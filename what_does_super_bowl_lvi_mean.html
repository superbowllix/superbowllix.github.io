        <p>Super Bowl LVI [11] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season.The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20.
