        <p>Anyway, as for the 2025 Super Bowl parade on February 10, expect it to step off roughly 30 minutes or less before Festival of Fantasy. That parade has two showtimes on Monday: noon and 3pm. If we’re going by past precedent, the Super Bowl pre-parade will step off between 2:30 and 2:45 pm, just before the second Festival of Fantasy. 
In 2018, the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory celebration cost $2.27 million, with both the team and the state chipping in. City taxpayers paid the remaining $1.5 million. Expenses included police and employee labor, security costs, and repairs to city equipment and property damaged during the celebrations. 
The last time the Eagles won the Super Bowl, the parade was held the Thursday following the big game. Ideally, it would be the same again, and not just because it gives fans nearly a week to  
Walt Disney World Hosting Super Bowl LIX Parade. The parade will take place at Magic Kingdom as players from the winning team ride down Main Street USA. An exact time for the parade has not yet been announced. Super Bowl LIX features the Kansas City Chiefs vs the Philadelphia Eagles and it will air on Fox starting at 6:30pm ET on Sunday  
The last few years of the Super Bowl parade have been at Disneyland in California. This year after the day of the game, the Super Bowl parade will take place at Disney World on Monday, February 10, 2025. Disney World has now confirmed through its Instagram story that the parade will occur on this day. There will typically be a short  
Mahomes appeared in the victory parade with Disney characters in Disneyland Park. The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a parade at Walt Disney World was in 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade on Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. 
The game is scheduled for Sunday, February 9, 2025, at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, with kickoff at 6:30 PM Eastern Time. The Chiefs, led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, are aiming for their third consecutive Super Bowl victory, a feat never before accomplished in NFL history.

The stage is set for Super Bowl LIX, with the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs set to battle it out on Sunday, February 9, 2025, in New Orleans. While fans eagerly anticipate the big game, Disney enthusiasts have an extra reason to get excited: the potential for a celebratory championship parade at Walt Disney World the very next day  
Super Bowl XXXI: Green Bay Packers 35, New England Patriots 21 Super Bowl XXXVI: New England Patriots 20, St. Louis Rams 17 Super Bowl XLVII: Baltimore Ravens 34, San Francisco 49ers 31 
If the Chiefs win Super Bowl LIX over the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans on Sunday, Kansas City will host a victory parade (per usual) but there will be no rally at Union Station. That

When is the 2025 Super Bowl? The 2025 Super Bowl will be held on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome at 5:30 p.m. Central time. Who is performing at the Super Bowl? 
Kansas City’s path to the Super Bowl was actually a lot smoother this season than last. The Chiefs' come-from-behind overtime victory against the San Francisco 49ers in 20-2024 capped off a tumultuous season, where a trip to (let alone a win in) Super Bowl 58 was never guaranteed. 
Expect more law enforcement officers at a public celebration if the Chiefs win the Super Bowl.  2025 Andy Alcock  75 troopers for a potential victory parade.“I think you're going to see a

Chiefs Have Alternate Plan to Celebrate Super Bowl Victory. The two-time defending Super Bowl champions do have a plan for the team to celebrate if they win a third straight championship. 
Jalen Hurts has a chance to do something only Nick Foles has ever done before: quarterback the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl victory. Standing in the way, just like in 2017, is an AFC dynasty. </p>
