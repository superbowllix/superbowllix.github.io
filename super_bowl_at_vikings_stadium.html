        <p>The Vikings then advanced to the NFC Championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, where the Vikings lost 38–7, costing the Vikings the chance to become the first NFL team to play a Super Bowl in its own home stadium. Super Bowl LII was played at the stadium on February 4, 2018 between the  
It has been 41 seasons since the Vikings last trip to the Super Bowl. If Minnesota can make it back this season, it will be the first team to play the Super Bowl in its own stadium. Published Jan  
The game will be held at U.S. Bank Stadium, which became the new home for the Minnesota Vikings in 2016. This marks just the second time in which Minneapolis has hosted a Super Bowl. 
On February 4, 2018, U.S. Bank Stadium hosted its first Super Bowl, the second for the city of Minneapolis. Super Bowl LII brought 67,612 fans and 5,800 credentialed media to the stadium and reached 103 million television viewers worldwide. U.S. Bank Stadium also became the home of the first “Zero Waste” Super Bowl, with 91% of trash recycled. 
The season is finally over for the Minnesota Vikings. After failing to beat Detroit and claim the NFC North crown on the last weekend of the regular season, the Vikings were forced to face the LA Rams in a Wild Card match-up. Due to the ongoing situation in Los Angeles, the game was moved to the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. 
Super Bowl VIII was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Minnesota Vikings and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Miami Dolphins to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1973 season.

The Minnesota Vikings have never won the Super Bowl. The Vikings have reached the Super Bowl a total of four times (1970, 1974, 1975, and 1977) but have never won. They are one of two teams in NFL history that have reached the Super Bowl four times without a win. 
Super Bowl IX was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Minnesota Vikings to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1974 season. 
In 1976, led by Rookie of the Year Sammy White and All-Pro Chuck Foreman, they made it to Super Bowl 11, their third Super Bowl appearance in four seasons, but lost in humiliating fashion to the Raiders 32-14. The closest Minnesota has come since was in 1998. With a 15-1 record, the Vikings were a heavy favorite to finally make a Super Bowl  
In the playoffs, the Vikings rallied to upend the Los Angeles Rams, 23-20, and destroyed Cleveland, 27-7, to claim the final NFL Championship and advance to Super Bowl IV against the AFL's Kansas  
All this makes it very difficult to project the Vikings’ future, and it makes it difficult to know if they are truly entering a winning window. From a broader perspective, however, the Vikings’ 2024 season raises the question of whether the oft-discussed notion of a “Super Bowl window” is truly a useful concept.

MINNEAPOLIS -- There was a thick fog surrounding U.S. Bank Stadium throughout Sunday, an endless cloud that skewed visibility outside the gargantuan windows of the Minnesota Vikings' downtown  
The first Super Bowl held in New Orleans was Super Bowl IV on January 11, 1970, in which the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 at Tulane Stadium, which held a crowd of 81,000 people. This was the last championship match between the NFL and AFL before the leagues completely merged. 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will meet in the Super Bowl for the second time in three seasons when Super Bowl LIX kicks off in New Orleans on Sunday evening (6:30 p.m. ET on FOX). 
The Vikings played in their second straight Super Bowl, Super Bowl IX (3rd overall), losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 16–6, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans on January 12, 1975.
