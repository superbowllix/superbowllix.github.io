        <p>Super Bowl halftime performers are paid the union-rate minimum. For Usher, that meant $671 for the actual performance last year and about $1,800 for the rehearsals leading up to the Super Bowl. 
The Super Bowl halftime show, despite hosting some of the world's biggest stars and attracting massive audiences, does not pay its performers. However, there's a specific reason for it. What began as a way to keep fans entertained during the Super Bowl's midgame break gradually evolved into a major spectacle. 
It has been widely reported that Super Bowl halftime performers do not get paid anything at all. This is not quite accurate, but the amounts involved are next to nothing for these A-list music acts. 
As it turns out, artists do not get paid for the Super Bowl Halftime Show—at least not by the NFL. The NFL does, however, cover all the production costs of the Super Bowl Halftime Show, so

Rihanna will not be paid to perform at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show on Sunday. The singer and beauty mogul is set to take the stage on Sunday, February 12, at halftime but won't be getting  
The Super Bowl is the most-watched event on television, drawing millions of viewers each year. In 2023, it was the most-watched in TV history when 118.7M fans tuned in for Rihanna's set. It’s an ideal time for artists to capitalize on upcoming tours, album promotion, brand deals, and, of course, bragging rights.

Especially with an artist of this caliber set to take over the field, viewers might be curious about the amount that halftime performers get paid to sing at the Super Bowl. Turns out, it's a lot  
NFL spokesperson Joanna Hunter told Forbes in 2016: "We do not pay the artists. We cover expenses and production costs." It is estimated that when Beyoncé first performed at the Super Bowl for  
Do Super Bowl halftime performers get paid? Despite the euphoria surrounding the event, entertainers do not get paid to play the Super Bowl. At least not what they usually make. 
According to Esquire, the Super Bowl still draws almost 100 million viewers, giving performers massive exposure. Rihanna is the main Super Bowl halftime performer for the February 12, 2023, Super Bowl. The Kansas City Chiefs are playing the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 2023. CBS Sports has a list of every other Super Bowl halftime  
So you might be wondering if the performers get anything for sharing their musical talents at the Super Bowl. It all boils down to free public relations exposure. 
The production surrounding the Super Bowl halftime show can cost upwards of $10 million and is arguably one of the biggest performances of the year for artists. 
Wild, but true. Historically, the NFL doesn't pay Super Bowl halftime performers, but that's because the coveted 13-minute slot is essentially A) a free concert smack in the middle of a football  
Super Bowl 57 is merely hours away, and the anticipation is at a fever pitch. However, aside from the big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, fans of Rihanna are also eagerly awaiting her halftime performance. 
However, the real value of the Super Bowl halftime show lies in its unprecedented exposure. The 2024 performance headlined by Usher drew massive viewership, continuing the trend set by Rihanna's  
More than 123.4 million viewers tuned in for Usher’s halftime show at last year’s Super Bowl, edging out Rihanna's performance in Glendale as the most-watched Super Bowl in history. That’s  
And Spotify reports that JLo and Shakira's streams surged by 335% and 230% respectively following their joint performance in 2020. How's that for Super Bowl trivia?

THE SUPER BOWL half-time show has become one of the most eagerly awaited moments in the pop culture calendar, drawing in million of viewers (including a huge number of non-football fans) each year  </p>
