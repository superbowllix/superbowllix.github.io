        <p>Confidence: Low - In three previous Super Bowl appearances, Mahomes has a 61.8% completion with five TDs and four INTs. He was clutch in the Super Bowl victories against the Niners and Eagles. Kelce has 23 receptions on 27 targets with 257 yards and three TDs in the playoffs, and that is going to be the key matchup against Warner and Greenlaw. 
We're finally here, r/NFL! The season is closing and we're in for a pretty great matchup. I hope you were all able to do well in your predictions this year and come out over .500. For the Championship games, I went 0-2, bringing me to 8-4. I've heard this matchup being called the Reid Bowl, or the Kelce Bowl. I'm just hoping for a great game  
I have time to killgonna do a full prediction lol My heart wants Cincy to win but I think the Rams experience in the Super Bowl will give them the slight edge. I have this game playing out like Pittsburgh/Arizona SB43 did. A couple of exciting late lead changes, but ultimately the Rams come out on top. SUPER BOWL 56

My Super Bowl winner value picks are either the Lions @ +1300 or the Eagles @ +1400! My long shot winner pick would probably be the Chargers @ +5000! As for my Super Bowl forecast, I don't think that you could go wrong grabbing the Chiefs to beat the 49ers @ +2700 or the other way around @ +2900!

I am not sold on Philly yet. I think New Orleans or the Rams are the most likely Super Bowl teams from the NFC. In the AFC, the only team I could truly see beating the Pats is Jacksonville because of their defense. I don't think they will though. So I'll say it'll be a Pats-Saints super bowl.

Hey r/NFL, it's Super Bowl week! As if you guys didn't already know that. I know everyone's already been making predictions over the last two weeks, but I would be remiss if I didn't complete my season-long string of prediction threads with one for the Big Show. Two weeks ago I did absolutely terrible with a big goose egg, going 0-2. 
Jaguars. (Lawrence is a good enough quarterback to win a Super Bowl and Allen is the most underrated pass rusher in the NFL.) Bills. (Have the pieces but Allen needs to take better care of the ball and himself.) Dolphins. (Show flashes but always seem to play like girls against good teams.) NFC in order: Eagles. (Clearly have the highest  
In their Week 9 matchup, the Chiefs were effective in keeping Hill away from making big plays. Mahomes is 9-2 at home in the postseason, but the offense just has not clicked the same this season. Look for McDaniel to be aggressive early. Tua gets his first career playoff victory over the defending Super Bowl champs. 
Travis Kelce Super Bowl MVP +2000 (FanDuel) I absolutely love this pick. Travis Kelce is a fantastic sleeper MVP candidate at this price. No TE has ever won Super Bowl MVP but Kelce regularly puts up WR numbers and is in the üêêconversation. 
Last week I barely broke even, going 8-8 on my picks and bringing my record to 152-88 on the season. How did everyone else do? We have five division games this week, with nine inter-conference and two cross-conference games lined up. We're also running one Saturday game this week, along with no Monday New Years Day matchups due to college bowl  </p>
