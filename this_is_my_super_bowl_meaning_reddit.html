The Superb Owl meme resurfaces every Super Bowl Sunday, causing many unknowing NFL fans to wonder about its meaning. Of course, "Superb Owl" is a misspelling of "Super Bowl." It's an anagram of the simplest degree, replacing one letter like a typo you'd receive from a lazy friend. The meme is back in the mainstream as Super Bowl LVIII approaches. 
A Super Bowl showdown with a little extra meaning. Returning to the Caesars Superdome for the biggest game of the season, the Eagles have a chance to win a Super Bowl in a stadium tied to their past.

Either switch days or places should make it a 3 day weekend. I heard on the radio studies show the Monday after the Super Bowl is the most unproductive day of the year Why not switch out a three day weekend for something lame like Presidents‚Äô Day?

Still to me, that's kind of referring to Hell as a place of torment which usually isn't considered a swear word, versus Hella fine meaning "great" or something else I thought is usually more like swearing (but like I said I don't know what they define as swearing).

Text from article. Call it what you want, but Taylor Swift has extended her pop culture dominance into 2024 in a big way.

6-bit is not Base 6 it's binary hence "bit". ENIAC and later Mauchley/Eckert computers like the UNIVAC did arithmetic using methods similar to how humans do it in Base 10 which made it faster and if memory serves more accurate for floating-point computations than similar systems of the era doing arithmetic in binary but I've never heard of an instruction set architecture relying on Base 6.
