This time, the Eagles will win the Super Bowl. It isn’t because the Eagles are better than the team that should have won that Super Bowl a couple of years ago: Their 17 combined wins are a  
The Eagles beat the Washington Commanders 55-23 to win the NFC Championship and advance to Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans. Meanwhile, Kansas City claimed its third straight AFC crown and the fifth in six seasons with a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills. 
The Eagles can and probably should win, but in the end, I think one of the best Super Bowl-capturing operations in recorded history will simply find a way to make it happen again. 
You can also get Hurts +350 to win Super Bowl MVP, which could make for a fun little arbitrage play. Consider throwing $21 on Barkley at +250 to win Super Bowl MVP and $17 on Hurts +350.

The NFL playoffs reach its climax in two weeks when the Chiefs and Eagles meet. We asked USA TODAY Sports' staff for their picks to win Super Bowl 59.

The Kansas City Chiefs must face one final test against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX in their quest to become the first team in NFL history to complete a championship three-peat.
