Philadelphia Eagles N (1, 0–1) Louisiana Superdome (2) [sb 6] New Orleans, Louisiana (5) 76,135: Ben Dreith  If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the  
Super Bowl LII (meaning Super Bowl 52 in Roman numerals) was an American football game in which the Philadelphia Eagles, who were winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the 2017 season, beat the New England Patriots, who were winners of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the 2017 season, 41-33 to become winners of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2017 season. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
The Eagles have won just one Super Bowl during their franchise's history. That came in Super Bowl 52, which was played in 2018 as part of the 2017 NFL playoffs.

While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14.

That Super Bowl was the first of four Super Bowls in five years for New England, one of which included facing the Eagles in Super Bowl LII. With the Eagles’ loss, the city of Philadelphia's sports championship drought continued (no Philadelphia-based pro sports team since the 1983 76ers won a title) until the Phillies won the 2008 World  
Em 23 de maio de 2018, a liga selecionou originalmente Nova Orleães como sede para Super Bowl LVIII, então provisoriamente agendado para 4 de fevereiro de 2024.

The 2004 season was the Philadelphia Eagles' 72nd in the National Football League (NFL).
