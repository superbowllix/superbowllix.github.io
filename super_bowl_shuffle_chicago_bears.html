We are the Bears Shufflin' through Shufflin on down Doin' it for you We'e so bad We know we're good Blowin your mind Like we knew we would You know we're just Struttin for fun Struttin our stuff For everyone We're not here To start no trouble We're just here To do the Superbowl shuffle Well they call me Sweetness And I like to dance Runnin the ball 
A s the Super Bowl returns to New Orleans this week, arguments will again heat up about whether the 1986 Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears are the best team in NFL history. But with personalities like Mike Ditka, Walter Payton, William “The Refrigerator” Perry, Richard Dent, Dan Hampton, Steve “Mongo” McMichael, and Jim McMahon, it’s

The legacy of the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only unbeaten team was safe, but the 1985 Chicago Bears would create their own legacy. “The Super Bowl Shuffle” might have been audacious, but it had good intentions—proceeds for Chicago’s needy—and it was tremendous fun.
