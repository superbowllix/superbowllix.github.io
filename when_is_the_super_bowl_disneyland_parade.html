        <h2><strong>when is the super bowl disneyland parade super bowl tv broadcast time</strong></h2>
        <p>The last few years of the Super Bowl parade have been at Disneyland in California. This year after the day of the game, the Super Bowl parade will take place at Disney World on Monday, February 10, 2025.

The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom. 
But since Super Bowl LVIII will be held this Sunday, February 11, 2024, I would say you’ve made a wise guess that the winning team would be visiting the resort on Monday, February 12, 2024. If that happens, I don’t believe an exact time will be announced, because the element of surprise will be a key part of the magic. 
Mahomes appeared in the victory parade with Disney characters in Disneyland Park.

This is the third time Disneyland will host the Super Bowl in as many years. Disneyland to host Super Bowl parade. 
The Super Bowl MVP is the third for Mahomes, who won the award last year in Super Bowl LVII and Super Bowl LIV in 2019. Each has ended with a national Disney commercial, a parade the day after the Super Bowl and a high-four with Mickey and the Disney gang at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles go head-to-head in New Orleans this Sunday, February 9th. The winning team from the NFL’s annual Super Bowl game is usually celebrated at Walt Disney World with the Most Valuable Player (MVP) being part of the iconic “I’m going to Disney World!” commercial, before starring in a parade down Main Street U.S.A. 
Visiting the Day After the Super Bowl. The day after the Super Bowl, attention shifts to whichever Disney park is hosting the winning team for their celebratory parade.In 2024, the tradition will continue at Disneyland Park when the LVII champions visit on February 13th. 
Walt Disney World Hosting Super Bowl LIX Parade. The parade will take place at Magic Kingdom as players from the winning team ride down Main Street USA. An exact time for the parade has not yet been announced. Super Bowl LIX features the Kansas City Chiefs vs the Philadelphia Eagles and it will air on Fox starting at 6:30pm ET on Sunday  
Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates the team's Super Bowl LVII win with a parade down Main Street, U.S.A., at Disneyland Park on February 13, 2023.
