        <p>There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season.

This shows the Lions are still searching for their first Super Bowl win. The Super Bowl Era: A New Challenge. Since the Super Bowl era started, the Lions have had trouble winning in the playoffs. They’ve had great seasons but never made it to the Super Bowl. The team’s success has changed since the 1950s. Now, they want to win a Super Bowl.

An early Super Bowl prediction. I had the Lions winning the NFC and facing the Kansas City Chiefs in my preseason Super Bowl prediction, and I don’t see much reason to change that now. The Lions are the best team in the NFC and they have the best non-weather-related homefield advantage in all of football. 
Detroit Lions fans had a vested interest in Super Bowl 56.. Not only did former Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford lead the Rams to a 23-20 win with a patented come-from-behind victory, but the
