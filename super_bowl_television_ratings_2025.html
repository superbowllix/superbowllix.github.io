Fox will air this year's Super Bowl and has "a chance" to deliver the most watched audience ever, said NFL Chief Media and Business Officer Brian Rolapp. 
After two of the last three Super Bowls because of the new TV contracts with the NFL, Fox won’t have the big game for four years as it is NBC (2026), ABC/ESPN (2027), CBS (2028) and then Fox in  
Super Bowl television ratings and shares, including network (both NBC and CBS televised the first Super Bowl). The rating represents the percentage of televisions tuned in to a program. The share is the percentage of televisions on at the time that watched: 
[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series.

The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until
