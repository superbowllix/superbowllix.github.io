        <p>Now we have “the Super Bowl massacre,” which was designed to make us not notice the war crimes that American taxpayers are funding. The attacks on Rafah should become a bigger part of football  
Super Bowl Massacre in Rafah Content warning: This article contains graphic images and content depicting and describing acts of genocide. While Americans watched and celebrated the Super Bowl this past Sunday, Israel ramped up its attacks and bombed Rafah – the last “safe” place left for Palestinian refugees seeking shelter. 
“#SuperBowlMassacre people in Rafah were kiIIed, while you cheered, our people died,” an X user said. “This was a z!onist fest.” “Israel  used the cover of the Super Bowl to launch an  
massacre Words are in a constant state of change: some become trendy, some get lost, and many soften over time. Massacre is one of those words that's broadened since first popping up in the 1500s. Originally, to massacre was to kill many people, and the term still has that meaning, often in reference to gun massacres. 
The attacks occurred at the same time as the Super Bowl in the US, and as images from Rafah hit people’s timelines, the hashtag #SuperBowlMassacre started trending online. 
4 of 5 | . FILE - People attend a candlelight vigil for victims of a shooting at a Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl victory rally, Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024, in Kansas City, Mo. Missouri prosecutors said Tuesday, Feb. 20, that two men have been charged with murder in last week’s shooting that killed one person and injured multiple others after the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl parade.

Downtown Kansas City had been a sea of red on Wednesday – Valentine’s Day – as Chiefs fans celebrated their third Super Bowl title in five seasons with the parade. On Sunday the team came

The Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl parade began around 11 a.m. local time and concluded at Union Station where players and coaches gave speeches that began at 12:45 p.m., local time.

The National Football League’s (NFL) forthcoming championship game, Super Bowl LIX, is set for February 9, 2025. This will be the 59th Super Bowl in NFL history. The event will occur at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
The Super Bowl has been used in the past to promote war, such as in 1991 when Whitney Houston sang the national anthem as warplanes flew overhead before Operation Desert Storm, and in 2002 when U2 and Bono performed in the wake of 9/11. The recent Super Bowl attack, now known as “the Super Bowl massacre,” is another example of this trend. 
Super Bowl viewers are a unique audience because they're as primed to watch the ads as they are the game. "This is a societal moment where we come together as a country,” said Kimberly Whitler  
On February 11, 2024, the Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII. On February 14, a victory parade and rally were held with a municipal budget of almost US$1 million. [12] The parade ran 2 miles (3.2 km) from Sixth Street to Union Station, culminating with the team and dignitaries giving speeches at the rally in front of the building. [13] 
The Sunday night series of airstrikes on Rafah, which caused another civilian massacre during the American Super Bowl, is only a taste of what is to come. In the early hours of Monday morning (Palestine time), while Americans were fixated on the Super Bowl, Israeli airstrikes pummeled the Gaza’s Rafah, killing upwards of 100 civilians. 
The hilarious new Dunkin' commercial ran just before the half-time break of Super Bowl LVIII, and was a brilliant display of the Massachusetts-based company and its famous hometown boys, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon (along with Tom Brady who retains honorary Beantown citizenship due to his long stint as quarterback for the New England Patriots). 
A year later, the AFL and NFL agreed to merge following the 1969 season, meaning that the fourth installment of the Super Bowl would be the final game ever played between the two leagues.
