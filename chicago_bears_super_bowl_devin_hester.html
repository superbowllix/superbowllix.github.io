This week, my special guest is Hall of Famer Devin Hester, the most prolific return specialist in NFL history. He played eight of his 11 pro seasons with the Bears and holds league records with 19 kick-return touchdowns, 14 punt-return TDs and 20 total return touchdowns, which also includes missed field goals, fumbles and interceptions. 
McMichael, 66, played 13 seasons with the Bears from 1981-93, appearing in a franchise-record 191 straight games.
