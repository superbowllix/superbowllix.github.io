        <p>But it was her Super Bowl show in California, referencing celebrated black figures of the past and recent black history, that gained the headlines. Super Bowl 50: Denver Broncos beat Carolina Panthers 
Beyonce caused controversy for performing her new single 'Formation' at half-time of the 50th Super Bowl, American football's end-of-season extravaganza, and the most-watched television event of the year in the United States in February 2016. 
Five days after Beyoncé’s Super Bowl half-time show in which dancers were clad in Black Panther inspired costumes and one dancer held up a "Justice 4 Mario Woods" sign, the controversy

After the Super Bowl performance on Sunday, February 7, Beyoncé’s choice of outfit caused news anchor Tomi Lahren to criticise her on the online show The Blaze. Beyoncé’s outfit was inspired by the Black Panthers, who were a militant party founded in 1966, aimed at promoting self-defence against the police, and formed specifically to  
Beyoncé stole the spotlight from Coldplay during the Super Bowl halftime show on Feb. 7. Former mayor Rudy Giuliani said her performance, which alluded to the Black Panthers and Malcolm X, was an  
Beyonce has remained silent in the face of the criticism. It almost makes one yearn for a time when the biggest controversy surrounding a Super Bowl halftime show was Janet Jackson‘s exposed nipple.

Beyoncé is inarguably among the most influential Black female voices worldwide, and the 28-time Grammy winner has never shied away from representing her heritage. Her halftime performance at the 2016 Super Bowl was, therefore, a power-packed tribute to two important moments in Black history: Michael Jackson and the Black Panthers. 
Beyonce fans were elated to see her perform at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. Unfortunately Beyonce herself apparently was not entirely content with how she looked during the performance. It came to light that after the Super Bowl, her publicity team attempted to scrub stills of her deemed incompatible with her curated image. Getty Images  
The Super Bowl performance a day later had folks clutching their pearls at her audacity to center blackness. Donned in black berets atop their fluffy ‘fros, Beyoncé’s dancers helped pay  
A day after the Super Bowl, people are still parsing over each frame from Beyonce's halftime performance, trying to glean the messages, both subtle and overt, that made for a stunning display of unapologetic blackness and political activism during one of the most-watched events of the year. The halftime show — seen by an estimated 112 million people — is drawing praise from her fans and

Similarities between Kylie Jenner and Beyoncé are causing controversy on social media. Queen Bey wowed onlookers at the Super Bowl on Sunday with her country-inspired outfit.

Those who missed the singer’s performance won’t be disappointed as the set, dubbed Beyoncé Bowl, will be available for streaming on Netflix. Previously, the Halo singer headlined Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 in New Orleans. She was joined onstage at the time by fellow Destiny’s Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. </p>
