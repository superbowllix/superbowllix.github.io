        <p>The first Super Bowl MVP to utter the now-iconic phrase was New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms, whose team defeated the Denver Broncos 39-20 in Super Bowl XXI in 1987. 
Since Simms became the first Super Bowl MVP to go to Disney in 1987, at least one player has uttered the line in all but one year (2005), when there was no commercial following Super Bowl XXXIX  
The Super Bowl Disney World trip is a decades-long NFL tradition. Since 1987, Super Bowl MVPs have been treated to a trip to "The Happiest Place on Earth. 
The beloved tradition dates back to Super Bowl XXI in 1987, according to Disney Parks Blog.As ESPN also reports, New York Giants quarterback and MVP Phil Simms was the first to shout the now  
And every year, the Super Bowl MVP does actually go to Disneyland in California, or another of Disney’s resorts, taking part in a parade in their honour a day after lofting the Lombardi. Watch Super Bowl LIX live on DAZN for just £0.99p 
35 years after winning Super Bowl MVP, the first man to say, "I'm going to Disney World!"  And if that isn’t really your taste, you can still go shopping at Disney Springs or enjoy the water  
Which players normally go to Disney World after the Super Bowl? Usually, the ‘MVP’ winner visits Disney World after the game, normally with a teammate and their families, which Mahomes has  
Since Simms became the first Super Bowl MVP to go to Disney in 1987, at least one player has uttered the line in all but one year (2005), when there was no commercial following Super Bowl XXXIX. It was a brief hiatus for the campaign, which has continued every year in the nearly two decades since. 
One of the Super Bowl's most famous and long-established traditions has nothing do with football, let alone the NFL. Every year, the Super Bowl MVP proclaims "I'm going to Disney World!" to an  
In 1987, Phil Simms, a former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, was featured in the first Disney post-Super Bowl ad exclaiming that he planned to go to Disneyland following his team  
Super Bowl LIV MVP Patrick Mahomes in the parade at the Magic Kingdom the day after the game "I'm going to Disney World!" and "I'm going to Disneyland!" are advertising slogans used in a series of television commercials by The Walt Disney Company that began airing in 1987. [1] 
I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information from the Disney playbook. I just spoke to an MVP of a Cast Member who confirmed that, at the time of this writing, no official announcement has been made about the Super Bowl parade. However, this Cast Member also told me that a Super Bowl parade generally occurs the day after the big  
The catch phrase “I’m going to Disney World” first attached to the Super Bowl MVP in 1987, after Phil Simms won the award after his Giants beat the Broncos. Ten years ago, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (pictured) pulled the Disney duty by winning the Super Bowl XLV MVP award. This year, the Super Bowl MVP will not be going to Disney  
At this time, we still don't know if the winning team of this year's Super Bowl will be visiting Walt Disney World or Disneyland for the parade of MVPs. With last year's game taking place in Las Vegas, the winning team went to nearby Disneyland for their parade , so it is possible that this year's parade will take place at Magic Kingdom since  
Unfortunately, we might have to wait until the iconic commercial airs to find out whether the Super Bowl MVP will visit the Disneyland Resort or the Walt Disney World Resort. Because the 2024 Super Bowl will be played in Las Vegas, I think it's likely that the MVP might visit Disneyland Park given that it is so closely located. I recommend  
If the winning team does head to Walt Disney World, fans can expect a magical celebration on Main Street, U.S.A., featuring the Super Bowl MVP waving to crowds, perhaps joined by a few teammates. This unforgettable moment will likely include appearances by Disney characters decked out in their celebratory best, music, confetti, and that classic  
The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom. 
Credit: Disney. As most marketed celebrity visits to Disney parks go, the winning Super Bowl team’s trip the Walt Disney World Resort or Disneyland is not really comprised of an actual vacation  
The most recent player to participate with an “I'm Going to Disneyland” statement was MVP Patrick Mahomes after the 2024 Chiefs' Super Bowl victory. In addition to getting paid for the commercial, the MVP enjoys the celebratory parade and a VIP tour with their family the following day at either Disneyland or Disney World whichever is closest. 
The 58th annual Super Bowl will be held on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Walt Disney World guests can watch the Super Bowl from the comfort of their in-room TVs or visit a variety of locations across Walt Disney World property, including many bars and lounges at Disney Springs and at Walt Disney World resorts. Stop by your resort  </p>
