        <p>The Kick of Destiny takes a slightly different format this year with two people taking part instead of just one, as Rob Gronkowski had done for the last two years. This year, Eli and Peyton Manning will be competing to see who can win the Kick of Destiny by successfully kicking a 25-yard field goal during the Super Bowl pregame show, 
Super Bowl 59 is on tap for Sunday, and for the third consecutive year, FanDuel Sportsbook users have the chance to participate in the free-to-play Kick of Destiny promotion for a shot at winning

The Super Bowl is the biggest day in football and FanDuel is once again raising the Sunday stakes even higher with the 2025 Kick of Destiny contest.. After two years of Rob Gronkowski starring, the Kick of Destiny 3 will feature legendary Manning brothers, Peyton and Eli. 
The sibling rivalry between Peyton and Eli Manning will be on full display on Super Bowl Sunday as the two will square off in FanDuel’s Kick of Destiny 3.. Instead of showing off their Super  
Eli Manning’s “dream” of being a kicker will come true during Super Bowl 59, as he and his older brother Peyton will compete in FanDuel’s Kick of Destiny 3 on Super Bowl Sunday. The Manning brothers will each attempt 25-yard field goals at 3pm ET during the Super Bowl Pregame Show on Sunday, Feb. 9. 
The FanDuel Kick of Destiny 3 is a Super Bowl promotional event that’s free to participate in, unlike last year when you had to wager at least $5 on the Super Bowl. Find the event in your promo  
Rob Gronkowski will attempt a field goal live during Super Bowl 58, a kick that puts $10 million in FanDuel free bets on the line.  when I missed the Kick of Destiny during last year's Super  
In its Kick of Destiny 3 promo, FanDuel is offering customers a share of $10 million in bonus bets if they pick the winner of Peyton vs. Eli Manning in a field-goal kicking contest on Super Bowl  
FanDuel is using this time to announce the continuation of its Super Bowl promo "Kick of Destiny," albeit with a few changes. In the past two years, former tight end Rob Gronkowski stood alone  
With FanDuel’s “Kick of Destiny 3” Super Bowl promo, FanDuel bettors simply choose which Manning brother will make the kick first. The winning side will get a share of $10 million in bonus  
Fresh off of coaching the Pro Bowl, brothers and football royalty Eli and Peyton Manning will show off what they learned from the NFL All-Stars in FanDuel Kick of Destiny 3 during the 2025 Super  
Super Bowl Sunday is here, which means football fans finally got to see legendary tight end Rob Gronkowski attempt a live field goal as part of FanDuel's Kick of Destiny 2. For the FanDuel users who correctly predicted that Gronk would miss the kick, you will now share a pot of $10,000,000 in Bonus Bets. 
The former NFL tight end missed a 25-yard field goal attempt, known as the "Kick of Destiny," ahead of Super Bowl 58 in Las Vegas, hooking it wide right. Gronkowski's field goal attempt was a part  
Rob Gronjowski’s “Kick of Destiny” was a fail. During the first-ever live Super Bowl commercial with FanDuel Sportsbook, the retired tight end missed the much-anticipated field goal kick. 
Welp, Rob Gronkowski let his believers down again. The FanDuel Kick of Destiny 2 took place prior to kickoff of Super Bowl 58, and Gronk just couldn’t put the football through the uprights. 
FanDuel’s Kick of Destiny has become a Super Bowl Sunday tradition. Since 2023, FanDuel has staged a field-goal-kicking contest that fans can bet on. Super Bowl-winning tight end Rob Gronkowski was the star of the FanDuel Kick of Destiny 1 and 2 . 
For Super Bowl 58, the ad is marketed as the Kick of Destiny 2 and is Gronkowski’s chance at redemption. The future Hall of Fame tight end and Fan Duel have already been on the promotion tour
