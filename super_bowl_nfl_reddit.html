My heart wants Cincy to win but I think the Rams experience in the Super Bowl will give them the slight edge. I have this game playing out like Pittsburgh/Arizona SB43 did. A couple of exciting late lead changes, but ultimately the Rams come out on top. SUPER BOWL 56

Confidence: Low - In three previous Super Bowl appearances, Mahomes has a 61.8% completion with five TDs and four INTs. He was clutch in the Super Bowl victories against the Niners and Eagles. Kelce has 23 receptions on 27 targets with 257 yards and three TDs in the playoffs, and that is going to be the key matchup against Warner and Greenlaw. 
#1- Super Bowl 51 Patriots-34 Falcons-28. I think this is the consensus opinion on the best Super Bowl out of this group and it has a good case for greatest Super Bowl ever but I think Ravens-49ers or Steelers-Cardinals are pretty hard to top. 
Seeing as the NFL doesn't pay people to perform it's always the same - people using that airtime to promote themselves and their shit. Pretty sure fenty sales or social media presence skyrocketed post superbowl at least for a bit. 
Keep in mind, the AFC representative lost 13 straight Super Bowls at one point. People started talking about how "the Super Bowl is always a bad game" because so many were lopsided. It was just an era where the top of the NFC was always better than the AFC. 
TSN will carry the Super Bowl ($20 monthly). TSN Plus ($8 monthly, included with TSN) will show a "data-enhanced" stream of the Super Bowl. DAZN will carry the Super Bowl as part of NFL Game Pass International ($30 monthly). This is probably true in many other countries where NFL GPI is available on DAZN. 
44 votes, 138 comments. true. Super Bowl 38 was a pretty insane game. Starts off as a defensive stalemate and then both offenses go off towards the end of the first half. 
Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money. </p>
