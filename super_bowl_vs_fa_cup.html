        <p>The FA Cup is WAY older than the Super Bowl. The first FA Cup Final was in 1872. In fact, the FA Cup had already been running for 95 years when Super Bowl I took place in LA in 1967. 
The FA Cup final is the obvious contender to compare with the Super Bowl for English sport. A famous tournament of the nation's favourite sport, settled by one single game that airs on terrestrial  
The FA Cup final (or maybe the semis) is more like the conference championship matches in the NFL playoffs. All three matches have great atmosphere and the teams are at top level. At the Super Bowl, the stadium is filled with rich people that aren't fans of either team, and the players play poorly from having two weeks off. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
Nah. Only gamblers care about the grand national. It's just an excuse to have a bet. No one actually cares about the actual race, they only care about whether they've won their bet. And it's in no way a big deal in the same way that the World Cup final is, or like how the Super Bowl is, or like the FA Cup final used to be. 
Manchester City vs. Tottenham (1981): Known for one of the most spectacular goals in FA Cup history, Ricky Villa’s solo effort for Tottenham in the replayed final is still replayed on highlight reels today. The Global Stage. Over time, the FA Cup has become much more than an English affair. 
A record 18,000 media credentials were issued for the World Cup in Qatar, according to FIFA. This weekend’s Super Bowl in Las Vegas will host over 6,000 credentialed members of the press. 
The Football Association Challenge Cup, or simply the FA Cup, is the world's oldest national soccer competition and the main domestic cup competition for men's teams in England. The Wanderers won  
But Super Bowl audiences are largely made up of domestic viewers, and are eclipsed by the global TV audiences of the 2022 men's World Cup final - which was watched by an estimated 1.5 billion

Welcome to my Predictions for the FA Cup 4th Round and the Super Bowl. FA Cup fixtures includeMan Utd vs LeicesterLeeds vs MillwallCoventry vs IpswichSoutham 
The third round of the Emirates FA Cup is underway, with Premier League teams entering the fray to battle it out with teams across the leagues. The two most successful teams in the history of the  
Super Bowl vs World Cup. As you can see, the numbers don’t lie when comparing the Super Bowl with the World Cup. If you want to compare football and soccer domestically, we have an NFL vs MLS article that may interest you. Also, here is one more look at the facts and figures comparing the Super Bowl with the World Cup. 
The FA Cup third round saw teams from the Premier League and Championship enter the fray in a magical time in the UK football calendar — and we’ve had upsets! Plymouth Argyle sit bottom of the Championship table but they went away to Premier League side Brentford and won 1-0 with Morgan Whittaker the hero for the Pilgrims as he scored a  
Liverpool vs Spurs team news. Trent Alexander-Arnold is Liverpool’s only absentee with a short-term thigh injury the wideman sustained during the 2-0 win at Bournemouth on Saturday. 
One of the most storied competitions in English soccer is intensifying as Premier League teams enter the FA Cup for the third round beginning on Thursday. In the 144th edition of the tournament  
This is funny, because you have pretended that my previous use of 'million' isn't implied in the further two numbers. I like humour, and you have used humour, in suggesting I meant 'one hundred and fifteen' viewers of the Superbowl in the United States of America, as opposed to my implied figure of 'one hundred and fifteen million' based on my previous sentence. 
The FIFA World Cup Final in 2018, which featured young phenom Kylian Mbappe and France defeating Croatia by a thrilling score of 4-2, had 3.57 billion viewers, per FIFA. For comparison, the 2022  
The 59th Super Bowl (Super Bowl LIX) kicks off this weekend, February 9, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, USA, in a clash between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs that is not only the height of American football but also a worldwide spectacle combining business, entertainment, and competition. 
How does the Super Bowl viewership compare to FIFA World Cup final? As per the official data from FIFA, the average viewership of the FIFA World Cup finals over the last three editions is in excess of 909.6 million. The 2010 FIFA World Cup had witnessed a viewership of 1 billion while the 2014 edition had a viewership of 562 million. </p>
