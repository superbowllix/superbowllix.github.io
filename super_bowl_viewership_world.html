        <p>In 1977, Super Bowl XI was watched by 81.9 million total viewers, beating the Game 7 viewership of the 1975 World Series and becoming the most-watched sports broadcast in American history. [69] 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
NEW YORK -- A global TV audience of 62.5 million viewers watched the Kansas City Chiefs defeat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Additionally, Australia's 2024 Super Bowl audience reach of around 3 million viewers was the most the country had since record-keeping began and it was a 26% increase from 2023's viewership. ×  
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
A global audience of more than 56 million watched the Kansas City Chiefs record a 38-35 victory over Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, a 7% increase over 2022 as international interest in  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
Explaining Super Bowl TV ratings in USA, around the world Edward Sutelan There's a reason it costs $7 million for an advertiser to have 30 seconds of screen time during the Super Bowl. 
That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
In 2023, the Super Bowl LVII raked in 115.1 million viewers on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming networks, which helped the event earn its place in history as the most-watched Super Bowl of all time. One of the most interesting facets about Super Bowl viewership is that not all viewers are sports enthusiasts. 
The Super Bowl on Sunday drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers who watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in a nail-biting overtime triumph, CBS Sports said in a  
How does the Super Bowl viewership compare to FIFA World Cup final? As per the official data from FIFA, the average viewership of the FIFA World Cup finals over the last three editions is in excess of 909.6 million. The 2010 FIFA World Cup had witnessed a viewership of 1 billion while the 2014 edition had a viewership of 562 million. 
The Super Bowl is the most popular sporting event in the world, and despite the Chiefs and Eagles meeting just two years ago in the Super Bowl, the matchup is still bringing in fans.

NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
Is The Super Bowl Losing Popularity? The Super Bowl is undoubtedly the most watched broadcast in the US year after year. According to the NFL, the highest Super Bowl viewership in NFL history was Super Bowl LVII in 2023, with 115 million views. The last time the NFL saw numbers like that was Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 with 114 million viewers. 
How many people watched the Super Bowl? 2024's Super Bowl had a viewership of over 123 million, making it the most watched TV telecast of all time. 
Sunday’s overtime thriller, which featured the Kansas City Chiefs facing off against the San Francisco 49ers, averaged 123.4 million viewers, CBS said Monday, breaking Super Bowl viewership records. 
This is because even by FOX’s assumptions, Super Bowl LVII could have fetched around 114.5 million views. The actual Super Bowl viewership numbers will come out in a couple of days but even if we go by the most optimistic assumptions, there is still a lot of catching up to do for NFL as far as attracting global viewership is concerned. </p>
