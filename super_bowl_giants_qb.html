Phil McConkey, the New York Giants wide receiver, got a Super Bowl touchdown in the fourth quarter of Super bowl XXI on a six-yard pass into the end zone from quarterback Phil Simms that was intended for Bavaro, the Giants' All-Pro tight end. 
Super Bowl XXV became the first Super Bowl to feature two teams representing the same state, even though the Giants technically play in New Jersey.
