        <p>Miami has hosted 11 Super Bowls. The last one, Super Bowl 54 in 2020, generated over $500 million for the local economy. On February 9, 2025, New Orleans will tie Miami as the city to host the  
The only three Super Bowl teams ranked ahead of the 1972 Dolphins were the 1985 Chicago Bears (who the Dolphins defeated in the regular season), the 1984 San Francisco 49ers, and the 1989 49ers. 
The Dolphins finished their perfect 1972 season by defeating the Redskins in Super Bowl VII. The Miami Dolphins joined the American Football League (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer Joseph Robbie and actor Danny Thomas in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie.

This is the uphill battle the Miami Dolphins face. There are no Super Swift tailor-made roads to the Super Bowl. It usually takes years of coming close, getting yourself back up again, and then trying again until, hopefully, a team has a breakout season where they get enough breaks along the way to make it to the Super Game. 
We look back: Dolphins' quest for three-peat Super Bowl started by playing the Oakland Raiders in an AFC divisional playoff game on Dec. 21, 1974.

Before beating the Dolphins on Sunday, Buffalo picked up a win over Miami on Oct. 1 and handed the team its first loss of the season. The Bills beat the Dolphins by a final score of 48-20 behind a great game from Allen, who threw for 320 yards and four touchdowns compared to zero interceptions.
