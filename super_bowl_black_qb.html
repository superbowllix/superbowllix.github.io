        <p>Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320  
Super Bowl LVII also marked the first time that both Super Bowl starting quarterbacks were black: Patrick Mahomes started for the Kansas City Chiefs, while Jalen Hurts started for the Philadelphia Eagles. [30] [32] The Eagles are the first team to have two different black starting quarterbacks start a Super Bowl. 
Steve McNair fell just one yard short of having a chance to become the second Black quarterback to win the Super Bowl. Spending most of his 13-year career with the Titans (he joined the franchise  
Selected third overall in the 1995 NFL Draft, Steve McNair was the highest-drafted Black quarterback at the time. He was a true dual-threat, leading the Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV against Kurt  
The first Black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl, he was named the game's MVP and went on to a long career as an NFL coach and executive. Steve McNair Season: 1999 | Team: Tennessee  
It would be another 26 years before another starting Black quarterback won a Super Bowl game. In the title game following the 2013 season, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson dominated Super Bowl 48 against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, leading his team to a 43-8 win to become the world champions. The 26-year-old QB completed  
Wilson was the first Black quarterback to appear in two Super Bowls. Heading into Super Bowl XLVIII the Seahawks were considered the underdogs facing the Broncos, led by the legendary, Peyton Manning. 
But racist assumptions kept Black players from the starting quarterback position for nearly another two decades. Doug Williams became the first quarterback to start in – and win – a Super Bowl in 1988. It was not until 2017 that all 32 NFL teams had started at least one Black quarterback. 
There's Marlin Briscoe, the first Black player in the Super Bowl era to start a game at quarterback. The Denver Broncos wanted to convert him to cornerback, but soon the team's white quarterback  
A decade later, he became the first Black quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl, in 1988 leading Washington over the Denver Broncos, 42-10. After the historic matchup with Hurts and Mahomes was set last month, Williams told NBC Philadelphia that he wants people to change their mindset surrounding the abilities of Black quarterbacks , adding  
Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320  
In the National Football League’s (NFL) history, three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. In 1988, Doug Williams, who played for Washington, made history as the first Black QB to win the NFL’s biggest game. Decades later, Russell Wilson would lead the Seattle Seahawks to victory in 2014 and, most recently, Patrick Mahomes of Kansas City won 2019’s Super Bowl after a standout  
The first time around when these two met in the Super Bowl, the headline was about history. It was the first time that two Black quarterbacks would play against one another as starters in the big  
Two more Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl since: Russell Wilson with the Seattle Seahawks in 2014 and Patrick Mahomes with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020. Williams was the first, a  
A Brief History. On January 31, 1988, Doug Williams quarterbacked the Washington Redskins to victory in Super Bowl XXII, the first time an African American quarterback had played in Super Bowl history. 
Only three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl — Mahomes, Williams and Russell Wilson. In 1969, James "Shack" Harris became the first Black QB to start a season-opener in the NFL — 15  
In 2023, Hurts and Mahomes made history as the first Black quarterbacks to face off in a Super Bowl. The game was an instant classic, with Mahomes leading the Kansas City Chiefs to a thrilling 38  
Black quarterbacks led both teams in Sunday’s Super Bowl. But for much of pro football history, Black players were steered away from the position because of racist assumptions. 
The fifth Black quarterback to start a Super Bowl — and the first to ever start two — was Russell Wilson, who led the Seattle Seahawks to back-to-back appearances following the 2013 and 2014 seasons.
