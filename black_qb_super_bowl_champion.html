In the National Football League’s (NFL) history, three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. In 1988, Doug Williams, who played for Washington, made history as the first Black QB to win the NFL’s biggest game. Decades later, Russell Wilson would lead the Seattle Seahawks to victory in 2014 and, most recently, Patrick Mahomes of Kansas City won 2019’s Super Bowl after a standout

Williams is best known for his performance with the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXII against the Denver Broncos, making him the first black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl.

The championship game is also significant from a cultural standpoint, marking just the second time in Super Bowl history that both starting quarterbacks are Black.

Kansas City failed to achieve the repeat victory in Super Bowl LV the next year, falling 31-9 to the Tom Brady–led Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Nevertheless, Mahomes has had a stellar career so far, and a victory in the upcoming Super Bowl LVII would make him the first Black quarterback to win the championship twice.

Washington won 42-10, and Williams was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to start in and win any NFL championship game, including those before the Super Bowl was established. 
It would be another 26 years before another starting Black quarterback won a Super Bowl game. In the title game following the 2013 season, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson dominated Super Bowl 48 against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, leading his team to a 43-8 win to become the world champions.

Williams ended the day 18 of 29 with four touchdowns (all in the second quarter). He set the Super Bowl record for most touchdown passes thrown in a quarter. Most importantly, the Redskins won their second title of the decade. Williams won Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to win the award. 
Williams was the first Black quarterback to win the Super Bowl, changing a narrative that Black QBs couldn't lead a team to a title while becoming a folk hero in the process.  CHAMPIONSHIP
