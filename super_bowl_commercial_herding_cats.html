The 2000 Superbowl commercial for Electronic Data Systems, which you can read a bit about on Wikipedia: 
Cowboys Herding Cats One of the funniest Super Bowl commercials ever. My favorite scene is the cats swimming across the river. 
While we wait for the newest ads from the companies that shell out $5.5 million for 30 seconds of airtime during the Big Game, here are a few of our favorite Super Bowl commercials from years pastall featuring cats, of course!

Cat Herders is the best animal Super Bowl ad with cats. Herding "10,000 half-wild shorthairs" does sound like quite the job. Complete with cowboys (or "catboys") trying to fetch cats out of trees, wrapping balls of yarn, and showing their battle scars, EDS really scored a touchdown with this ad.
