The Super Bowl Indicator is a spurious correlation that says that the stock market's performance in a given year can be predicted based on the outcome of the Super Bowl of that year. It was "discovered" by Leonard Koppett in 1978 [ 1 ] when he realized that it had never been wrong, until that point. 
The thesis behind the Super Bowl stock indicator is this: If an AFC team wins the Super Bowl, a stock market decline or bear market can be expected by year-end. Conversely, if an NFC team wins, it  
And a Super Bowl win for an AFC team hasn’t been bearish for stocks in recent years, either. The past four times an AFC team was crowned as champs — the Chiefs in 2020, the New England Patriots in 2019 and 2017, and the Denver Broncos in 2016 — the blue chip stock gauge finished the year up 7.3 percent, 22.3 percent, 25.1 percent and 13.4  
The stock market and the Super Bowl winners were only in sync in 2021 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFC) won. The S&amp;P 500 gained 14.51% that year. Furthermore, the indicator has many flaws since many teams, such as the Pittsburgh Steelers, changed conferences. 
The Super Bowl Indicator, a curious financial superstition, has captivated the minds of investors and sports enthusiasts alike since its introduction by Leonard Koppett in 1978.

For instance, the higher the points scored in a game, the better for the stock market. "When the teams in the Super Bowl combine to score at least 46 points, the stock market returns 16.3% on  
That’s because they believe in the well-known “Super Bowl Indicator,” which says the U.S. stock market will rise for the year so long as the game’s winning team was never a part of the  
There is obviously no logical reason for the Super Bowl outcome and the stock market to be related, but the Super Bowl indicator has a surprising rate of accuracy of around 80%. So is it true?
