        <p>The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. [1] 
The NFL casts a new trophy every year to award to the Super Bowl champion. The Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots have the most Lombardi Trophies with six. The 49ers can claim their  
The original trophy was produced by Tiffany &amp; Co. in New Jersey, but as of 2017, it has been made in Cumberland, Rhode Island. They say that winning the Super Bowl Trophy is priceless. Well, that’s not entirely accurate. The trophy costs $50,000 to produce and takes four months and 72 hours of labor to complete. 
Here’s how Tiffany &amp; Co. came to create the first-ever Super Bowl Trophy for the NFL in 1966, plus how it’s made year after year. 
The Lombardi Trophy is awarded annually to the winner of the Super Bowl, crowning that team as the NFL champion. It was first presented to the Green Bay Packers on Jan. 15, 1967, at the conclusion  
Since Super Bowl 45, the Vince Lombardi Trophy has been prominently featured in the Super Bowl logo design. The first trophy, inscribed with the words “World Professional Football Championship,” was awarded to the Green Bay Packers on January 15, 1967, after they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 1. 
The Chiefs have grown quite familiar with the craftsmanship that goes into the formation of a Lombardi Trophy with two Super Bowl wins in the last four years. This year they've got another strong  
The Lombardi Trophy stands as a testament to the dedication, teamwork, and perseverance required to achieve greatness in the NFL. For players and fans, winning the Super Bowl and raising the Lombardi Trophy represents the culmination of a season-long journey filled with highs and lows. 
An AWOL trophy: This Sunday marks the 49 th Super Bowl, but Tiffany &amp; Co. has actually crafted 50 trophies. The Baltimore Colts captured the Vince Lombardi Trophy for Super Bowl V in 1971; owner Carroll Rosenbloom traded the Colts for the Rams in 1972, but in what’s now considered a rather sneaky move, he finagled to get the trophy back into his hands a few years later for a Super Bowl party  
Though American football has been played since 1869, the first Super Bowl trophy was awarded nearly 100 hundred years later in 1967 when the Green Bay Packers, led by head coach Vince Lombardi, routed the Kansas City in Super Bowl I. Lombardi also won 2nd Super Bowl the following year as well against the Oakland Raiders. 
With the 2024 NFL season at its midpoint, our analysts revisit their preseason predictions for which teams will compete for -- and capture -- the Lombardi Trophy at Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9, 2025  
The Vince Lombardi trophy is the prize that the two teams in the Super Bowl battle it out for. But the winning team is not just given a shiny new trophy to put on show at their stadium, each  
Being the Super Bowl MVP is a monumental honor, but what this player really receives is more than just glory. A physical trophy, a trip, and even million-dollar contracts await the chosen one  
The Super Bowl MVP trophy has been won by some of the biggest names in American football history. Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, and Patrick Mahomes are just a few of the past  
SUPER BOWL PREDICTIONS: How the 2025 Super Bowl could go terribly wrong for Saquon Barkley and the Eagles 1. Empower Jalen Hurts to make throws against one-on-one coverage 
A new trophy has been crafted every year since Super Bowl I, made entirely of gleaming silver over the course of a painstaking four-month process at Tiffany’s workshop in Cumberland, Rhode Island. 
The Super Bowl MVP is known as the Pete Rozelle Trophy, but who votes for the award and how does the voting process work? The Pete Rozelle Trophy wasn’t awarded until Super Bowl XXV, but the NFL always recognized a Super Bowl MVP — even if the award was presented by SPORT magazine through 1989. 
Well a couple of things to know. There are at minimum 2 Lombardi trophies given to the team. One is usually kept somewhere safe like in a team museum (like the Patriots do) or with the owner. 
Winning a Super Bowl can assure immortality for teams and a shiny new Lombardi Trophy to put on display, but it also comes with a tidy paycheck for those players fortunate enough to compete for  </p>
