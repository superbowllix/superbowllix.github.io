        <p>The New York Jets, led by head coach Weeb Ewbank (who was the head coach of the Colts when they won the famous 1958 NFL Championship game and later the '59 title also), finished the season with an 11–3 regular season record (one of the losses was to the Oakland Raiders in the infamous "Heidi Game") and had to rally to defeat those same  
He led the Jets to the AFL championship in 1968 and the AFL-NFL championship in Super Bowl III. Walt Michaels led the team to the AFC championship game in 1982; he was also honored as the Pro Football Weekly NFL Coach of the Year and UPI AFC Coach of the Year in 1978. 
The following NFL head coaches have coached in two or more Super Bowls. Of eligible coaches not in the Hall of Fame, only two have had three or more appearances: Mike Holmgren and Dan Reeves. There are only two eligible coaches with multiple wins to not be inducted into the Hall of Fame: George Seifert and Mike Shanahan.

The Jets shutout of Earl Morrall and the Baltimore Colts through most of the game is a Super Bowl 3 element some youngsters might not realize. It wasn’t until Johnny Unitas entered the game that the Colts put points on the board. But for Baltimore and head coach Don Shula, it was too little, too late. 
Today we have Super Bowl III, the Third AFL-NFL World Championship Game, between the NFL champion Baltimore Colts and the AFL champion New York Jets. This game was played on January 12, 1969, at the Miami Orange Bowl. As discussed last week, Super Bowls II &amp; III are the only Super Bowls played back-to-back at the same stadium. 
The Jets' defensive line coach for Super Bowl III was Buddy Ryan, who later served as the mastermind behind the 1985 Bears' vaunted 46 defense. Baltimore's defensive coordinator was Chuck Noll,  
Coming off back-to-back Packers (NFL) victories and capturing the focus of over 50 million Americans, the NFL and AFL soon realized that these annual football championships were a massive hit. The two leagues officially dubbed the Third AFL–NFL Championship Game in 1969 “Super Bowl III,” the first of its kind. January 12, 1969, was the [] 
Coaches Baugh, Turner and Ewbank are all members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame; Baugh and Turner were inducted as players, while Ewbank was inducted as a coach/administrator. Three times in Jets history, the team has had an "interim" head coach. In 1975, Charley Winner was fired as head coach after leading the Jets to a 2–7 record. [4] 
The New York Jets stunned the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Fifty years later, the game resonates as a tipping point in pro football history. Saturday marks the 50th anniversary of the

The Jets won the AFL championship in 1968, and then went on to win Super Bowl III in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. Ewbank, who was known as a mild-mannered coach who favored simple but well-executed strategies, retired after the 1973 season and settled in Oxford, Ohio .

The Super Bowl III rings have created family bonds among strangers, helped cover medical costs and inspired acts of kindness.  Former Jets coach Rex Ryan drew straws with his brother and now  
In the 2023-2024 season, Bill Belichick (arguably the best NFL coach of all time) and Pete Carroll were numbers 1 and 3, respectively, on the list of highest paid NFL coaches. As of now, neither is an active coach in the NFL. 
On December 29, 1968, the Jets finally got revenge on the Raiders in the AFL Championship. 50 years later, players reflect on that season and why that game almost meant more than the Super Bowl win.
