        <p>From Michael Jackson to Beyonc√©, Lady Gaga to Rihanna, the Super Bowl halftime show is arguably one of the most iconic performances in an artist‚Äôs career..

Usher's half-time performance during this year's Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers has come under fire from thousands across the globe. As the players took a well-deserved break in the Allegiant Stadium locker rooms, Usher took to the field to belt out a long list of his best-known hits.

Yeah it should‚Äôve been the halftime show in the Atlanta Super Bowl instead of maroon 5 . Atlanta should‚Äôve had the about as Atlanta af as you can get halftime show. Reply reply 
Alicia Keys being there made perfect sense. She and Usher collabed on ‚ÄúMy Boo‚Äù in 2004 and it was a hit. Usher was long retired before she got to the scene. No. Alicia Keys‚Äô first album was released in 2001, same year as Usher‚Äôs 8701. Usher was well established but hardly retired. He hadn‚Äôt even released Confessions yet. Cee Lo in glasses

Roller, derby, aggressive, and session/jam skaters are surprisingly populous, and the network is pretty intimate.
