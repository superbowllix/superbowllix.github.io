        <p>On January 31, 1988, he became the first black quarterback to start in the Super Bowl, and a few hours later, the first to win it, ironically wearing the Super Bowl ring of the last team in the league to integrate black players. [28] Williams threw for 340 yards and four touchdowns–Super Bowl records at the time–and was named Super Bowl MVP. 
Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320

It would be another 26 years before another starting Black quarterback won a Super Bowl game. In the title game following the 2013 season, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson dominated Super Bowl 48 against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, leading his team to a 43-8 win to become the world champions. The 26-year-old QB completed  
The upstart Eagles star was right: Only seven other Black quarterbacks have taken the Super Bowl stage as starters since the big game's inception at the end of the 1966 season.

Wilson was the first Black quarterback to appear in two Super Bowls. Heading into Super Bowl XLVIII the Seahawks were considered the underdogs facing the Broncos, led by the legendary, Peyton Manning. 
The emotion he felt was decades in the making — 35 long years since Williams became the first Black quarterback to start in, and win, a Super Bowl when he was under center for the Washington  
But the history of African American quarterbacks in the Super Bowl goes back 35 years, with the one and only Doug Williams, the first Black quarterback to both start and win in the championship game. 
In the National Football League’s (NFL) history, three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. In 1988, Doug Williams, who played for Washington, made history as the first Black QB to win the NFL’s biggest game.

The following year, he became the first black quarterback to repeat as Super Bowl champion.
