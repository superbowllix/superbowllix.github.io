        <p>Jackson is the only quarterback to win the MVP award since Brian Sipe of the Cleveland Browns in 1980 who has never played in a Super Bowl. Jackson is also the only player with multiple MVP awards  
But in 2006, the Colts won their first Super Bowl. Jackson, whose team is 3-5 in his playoff starts with one AFC championship appearance, will enter his eighth NFL campaign looking for a similar  
At age 11 Jackson won the South Florida FYFL Super Bowl. Jackson, his brother Jamar and the Northwest Broward Raiders beat the Fort Lauderdale Hurricanes, who had been back-to-back champions with a long winning streak.

On the night he was drafted, Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson boldly promised that he would bring a Super Bowl to Charm City. Seven years later, he's still looking to fulfill that

Almost 30 years after Jackson's Super Bowl performance, the Super Bowl returned to Los Angeles. With the game being held in Los Angeles for the first time in 29 years, some of the city's best
