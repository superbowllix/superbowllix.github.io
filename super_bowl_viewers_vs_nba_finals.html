        <h2><strong>super bowl viewers vs nba finals super bowl mvps list</strong></h2>
        <p>In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
Which Is Viewed More – the Super Bowl or the NBA Playoffs? It’s estimated that 103.4 million people worldwide watched the Philadelphia Eagles beat the New England Patriots, 41-33, in Super Bowl LII last season. The season before that saw slightly higher numbers when 111.3 viewers tuned in to Super Bowl LI. 
Super Bowl. Kansas City Chiefs vs San Francisco 49ers. 123.4. NBA.  Viewership for the NBA Finals peaked back in 2017, when the league was able to average 20.4 million average viewers. 
The 2021 NBA Finals were about as successful as a Milwaukee vs. Phoenix matchup in July could be, and grew 32% in total viewers from last year’s series (when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the  
In the context of the current state of the television industry, Super Bowl LVII beat the NBA Finals' viewership by a significant margin. The former reportedly had 113.06 million viewers tuned in. 
Number of Super Bowl viewers in the United States from 2017 to 2023, by type (in millions)  Premium Statistic NBA Finals TV viewership in the U.S. 2000-2024  
Compare the Super Bowl to the entirety of the NBA Finals. Compare a Wild Card Round game to a first-round NBA matchup.  Viewership for the 2022 NBA Finals is up 37 percent from last year and  
The 2023 NBA Playoffs averaged a 2.7 rating and 5.12 million viewers across ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV, marking the highest average in five years (2018: 5.21M) and third-highest in a decade. After bottoming out at a 1.8 and 3.08 million in the fanless summer and fall “bubble” of 2020, playoff viewership has increased in three-straight years. 
In Super Bowl LI, the New England Patriots were able to come back from a 28-9 Atlanta Falcon lead in order to capture the Vince Lombardi trophy. There has, however, been a trend of poor super bowl performances, and fans are starting to question the importance of watching. NBA becoming predictable. The NBA finals have been a piece of work as well. 
The Bulls won the series to extend their record in the Finals to 5-0. The 2017 matchup between the Cavaliers and Warriors is the only NBA Finals among the most-watched to happen after the Bulls era ended in 1998. The series drew an average of 20.4 million viewers who watched Golden State capture the title. Ranking The Most Watched NBA Finals  
This figure beats every other sporting event: the '24 NBA Finals averaged 12 million, the '23 UEFA Champions League final attracted 450 million viewers, and the '24 Super Bowl had 173 million (123 million in the United States). 
The 2024 NBA Finals were watched by an average of 11.3 million viewers in the United States. This marked a decline from the previous year when over 11.6 million viewers tuned in to watch the  
Let's pretend the NBA Finals was single elimination. 11% of Americans say basketball is their favorite sport. 7% of Americans say soccer is their favorite sport. 37% of Americans say football is their favorite sport. If the Super Bowl had 113m viewers, we'd expect the Finals to get 34m viewers. The World Cup final had 25m US viewers this year. 
The 2021 NBA Finals were about as successful as a Milwaukee vs. Phoenix matchup in July could be, and grew 32% in total viewers from last year's series (when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the  
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
The Super Bowl is only one game so there are a ton more people watching, but then again the NBA Finals have 6 more games than the NFL Final. Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event of the year by a wide margin. People who haven’t watched a single NFL game all year will plan Super Bowl parties. That’s not to say that people consciously think ‘winning the Super Bowl is more impressive than winning the NBA Finals’. But way more people care about the former than the latter. 
The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. 
On ESPN's ‘Get Up’, Ryan Clark further explained that being the top seed doesn't guarantee progress in the NFL playoffs. He said: “Wildcard teams, number 7 or 8 seeds don’t win the NBA  
The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to date.A  </p>
