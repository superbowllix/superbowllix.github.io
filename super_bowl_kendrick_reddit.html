        <h2><strong>super bowl kendrick reddit super bowl rings through the years</strong></h2>
        <p>Great for Kendrick fans, or at a festival, but might not hit for the general public at the Super Bowl. Needs to be a livelier, louder, upbeat, mainstream and popular song. Would‚Äôve been cool tho! I mean I was here hoping for the 0.01% chance of Now Or Never üòÇ 
Kendrick will then say into the microphone, ‚ÄúNew. Album. Out Now.‚Äù A cloud of smoke will suddenly form around him, and when the smoke clears, Kendrick will be gone. Thinking he‚Äôs playing some sort of prank, you will check streaming services, and there it is, Kendrick‚Äôs new album. The super bowl is taking an hour break so you can listen  
But I listen to many artists from many genres including hip hop and to see a group of GOAT hip hop artists doing the Super Bowl was fucking sweet. I loved how it had Dre, Snoop, 50, Em, but Kendrick also there to rep the younger generation. Fucking great performance, most memorable halftime show in years. 
As if Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs recent history-making wins at the 2025 Grammys weren‚Äôt enough to get you exc ited for his upcoming Super Bowl LIX halftime performance, then theorizing about which songs  
Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs first Super Bowl halftime show appearance came in 2022, where he joined Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Eminem, 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige at Super Bowl LVI. Lamar was only on stage for a

A Drake and Kendrick Lamar reunion would collectively break the Super Bowl and the internet. While the chances of it actually happening are slim to none, Kendrick could choose to be "humble" and bring out Drake for their 2012 classic hit "Poetic Justice", paying tribute to their legendary beef that helped propel Kendrick to an unthinkable level of hip-hop greatness. 
Kendrick dedicates the first track on GNX to that situation, as well as his larger legacy and the wider reaction to the news that he would headline Super Bowl LIX. As Kendrick tells it, he took  
As if Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs recent history-making wins at the 2025 Grammys weren‚Äôt enough to get you excited for his upcoming Super Bowl LIX halftime performance, then theorizing about which songs  
In the September 2024 NFL ad announcing Kendrick Lamar as the halftime performer at Super Bowl 59, the 37-year-old rapper stands before a colossal American flag, feeding footballs into a machine  
Yeah, if there was a time to use 2Pac at a Super Bowl in Los Angeles, it for SURE would've been California Love and they got that out the way at the beginning of the half. I Ain't Mad At Cha is a classic song but it doesn't scream half time show performance lol. 
I've been watching it an embarrassing number of times. One thing that I noticed is how much Kendrick has evolved as an artist. It's breathtaking like I would not have imagined that GKMC Kendrick would performance with choreography and dance like that at the superbowl üòÖ ( the contrast between maad city at the gramnys and superbowl is amazing). 
Imagine this, the year is 2025, the Eagles and the Colts face off for the Super Bowl. The half time performer is Kendrick and goes his whole set without playing the song because UMG and the NFL banned it. 
Generation X was born, by broadest definition, between 1961 and 1981, the greatest anti-child cycle in modern history. Nevertheless, we grew up to become the world's most devoted parents: the "workhorse of America."

I think there‚Äôs a chance we have a single off the album released by then, maybe even the Friday before the Super Bowl the single drops. I also think there‚Äôs a chance it could be something off Dre‚Äôs upcoming album or something because rumors came out last year that Kendrick, Eminem and Dre were all working on music together and we had the Dre x Eminem snippet leak this past December I

Drake‚Äôs baiting of Kendrick ramps up on Instagram Drake drops Taylor made freestyle, again baiting Kendrick with AI Pac and snoop People use the timer to say Kendrick needs to respond within X hours Narrative begins that Kendrick is taking too long to respond People realise Drake had sus bars about young girls on the track 
basic synopsis is that Dre walks out on stage to Still D.R.E. but doesn't rap into it, there's a very cohesive "classic Dre beats" segment with Snoop, MJB and Eminem where Dre is onstage adlibbing but only does like one actual verse, Eminem does Lose Yourself which feels like it lasts too long but they need to milk because its the only part  </p>
