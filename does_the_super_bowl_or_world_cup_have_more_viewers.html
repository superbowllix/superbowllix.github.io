Qatar is expected to have 3 million fans across the world come into the country to attend live matches, which is just shy of the 3.1 million fans in the 2018 World Cup in  
The Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup wield considerable cultural and social influence, though in different contexts. In the U.S., the Super Bowl has become a cultural phenomenon. Super Bowl Sunday is an unofficial national holiday, with parties, family gatherings, and special events taking place across the country. 
More people tune into the World Cup Final than the Super Bowl, simply because soccer is a worldwide sport.
