The Baltimore Ravens last won the Super Bowl in the 2012 season. The Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in the Super Bowl. 
The game marked the first Super Bowl in which both of the teams had appeared, but had not yet lost a previous Super Bowl; the 49ers came into the game having won all five of their previous Super Bowl appearances, while the Ravens had won in their lone previous Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. 
Both players won a Super Bowl with the team, earned numerous Pro Bowl and All-Pro selections, and are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Along with their pick in the next year's draft, this was the highest first-round draft pick that the Ravens have had. In 1996, 2000, 2003, 2018, 2021 and 2022, the Ravens had two first-round draft picks.

The Ravens won the first of their two Super Bowls in the 2000 season If there was ever a team that proved that defense wins championships, it was the 2000 @Ravens . #OTD in 2001, Baltimore forced five turnovers and allowed no offensive TDs as it beat the Giants, 34-7, in Super Bowl XXXV. 
On Jan. 28, 2001, the Ravens played in the first Super Bowl in franchise history. Baltimore decimated the New York Giants, 34-7, at Super Bowl XXXV, bringing home the first of the two Lombardi Trophies sitting at the Under Armour Performance Center. It had been an interesting season for the Ravens, the second year under coach Brian Billick. 
With the win, and the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Diego Chargers, the Ravens clinched their sixth playoff berth in seven seasons, and the first since winning Super Bowl XLVII. In the wildcard playoff game, the Ravens won 30–17 against their divisional rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, at Heinz Field.
