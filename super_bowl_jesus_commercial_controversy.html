One year after ads by the He Gets Us campaign ignited a social media debate, a new round of Jesus-centric Super Bowl commercials on Sunday night found believers divided once again. 
A Christian commercial about Jesus that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday angered some conservatives who felt like the advertisement justified certain sins. 
The "He Gets Us" campaign, which describes itself as an effort to remind people of "the example that Jesus set while inviting all to explore his teachings so we can all follow his example of confounding, unconditional love," aired a 60-second ad during Super Bowl LVIII Sunday. The ad, titled "Foot Washing," featured still photographs of people  
T he agency behind the viral Jesus advertisements that played during Sunday night's Super Bowl explained why it welcomes controversy surrounding their campaign, after the ads drew backlash from  
A couple of controversial multimillion-dollar Christian advertisement campaigns featuring foot-washing scenes faced a holy mess during the 2024 Super Bowl, officially known as the Super Bowl LVIII. 
The advertisements are taking over social media after two commercials ran on Super Bowl Sunday, with some people saying those behind the campaign aren't what they seem. 
A multimillion-dollar Super Bowl ad campaign telling viewers that Jesus Christ "gets" them is the latest controversy surrounding the NFL's biggest event of the year. 
By the time the commercial aired, the ad campaign itself had caused more than a few fights. Religious leaders, LGBTQ rights activists and even some politicians have questioned the motives of the “He Gets Us” movement in recent weeks, as buzz about the then-forthcoming Super Bowl ads grew. 
In eight of the ad’s 12 images, the person doing the foot-washing is a put-together, cisgender-presenting white person, some middle- and some working-class, washing the feet of their presumed

Seth Andrews, podcast host of "The Thinking Atheist", says these ads may be trying to reinforce ideas that relate to Christian nationalism. He weighs in on b 
He Gets Us, a $100 million campaign reimagining Jesus’ message, is airing a 60-second “True Greatness” spot at Super Bowl 2025. Learn how the nonprofit Come Near, Jon Batiste’s Love Riot Festival, and AI-driven art are shaping this year’s faith-based outreach. 
The blood of Jesus wasn’t meant to whitewash right wing politics. This faux Christian right wing recruiting and bad faith Christians that are still privileged as people of faith is what is emptying churches of people of conscience. 
The "He Gets Us" Christian ad campaign made waves during the 2024 Super Bowl game. A spokesperson for the brand explained their message and respond to critics.

Super Bowl ads are by no means cheap, and reports estimate that “He Gets Us” paid roughly $7 million per 30-second ad spot. The campaign paid for two slots, a 3-second ad, and a full 1-minute ad. 
The buzziest Super Bowl ads of 2024 weren’t all the typical humorous, celebrity-driven ads of years past. Some of this year’s most discussed ad spots are a pair of pro-Jesus commercials that seemingly no one – Christians and non-Christians alike – is happy with. Controversial Feet Washing 
Setting a record with a staggering 123.4 million viewers, the Super Bowl was the most-watched American television broadcast in a generation, and all of those </p>
