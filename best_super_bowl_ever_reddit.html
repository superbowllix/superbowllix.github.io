        <p>I mean I get people will shit on Super Bowl 53, but I definitely isn't the only boring Super Bowl of the last 20 years. Ravens/Giants was boring Bucs/Raiders was boring Steelers/Seahawks was boring and was a horrifically reffed game Colts/Bears was eh Seahawks/Broncos was a complete beatdown and never in doubt. Broncos/Panthers was eh. 
2014 Divisional Round against the Ravens though. overcame a 14 point deficit twice.That game was something else. SB51 was incredible and is definitely up there in best games, but I've seen that game before against the 49ers, I think back in like 2012 was the game where we got blown out and then came back hard (lost unfortunately by like 3 points) and the Broncos I think in 2013 where we were  
The NFL gives teams $4,000 for each Super Bowl ring, and team owners spend their own money to improve them. The rings Chicago Bears players received from the McCaskey family for Super Bowl XX cost $4,000. 
Super Bowl LVII has all the ingredients to be a classic, but the Eagles and Chiefs have a lot to live up to. Here are the top 10 greatest Super Bowls of all time. 
HM. Super Bowl XXXVI: Patriots 20, Rams 17. Nobody saw Tom Brady coming at this point. This emotional game, played in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, was all about Kurt Warner and St. Louis

2. Super Bowl XXIV: January 28, 1990, Superdome in New Orleans . San Francisco 49ers 55, Denver Broncos 10 . Joe Montana throws a pass against the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl XXIV on Jan. 28  
In the postseason, Young’s offense scored 44, 38, and 49 points in the Niners’ three wins. In the Super Bowl, Young torched the Chargersto put it lightly. Young finished with 325 yards and six touchdowns. Jerry Rice put together another historic Super Bowl performance of his own — hauling in 10 catches for 149 yards and three TDs. 
What's the greatest Super Bowl of all time?  LI was the best I ever watched -- and the most exciting." Ric Tapia/NFL 50 / 52 3. Super Bowl XLIX - New England Patriots 28, Seattle Seahawks 24 
But recency bias is another issue all to itself. Too much emphasis is placed on the most recent Super Bowls because they are fresh in our memory. Jets-Colts is considered one of the greatest games ever, but Super Bowl III occurred 47 years ago. Personally, I think Super Bowl XIII was the greatest ever - Steelers vs Boys. 
Prince wasn't just the best super bowl halftime show. That was one of the best concerts ever. I don't even particularly like Prince's music, but his presence on a stage is unrivaled.

Patrick Mahomes in his first 4 years as a starter: 4 AFC Championship game appearances all in Arrowhead, 2 Super Bowl appearances (so far) a Super Bowl win, Super Bowl MVP, and regular season MVP. r/nfl 
I was working at a restaurant during the Super Bowl that year and I remember the game was on in the managers office so people could just filter in and out and kind of keep tabs on what was going on. But when that halftime show started I think every employee in that building was jammed into that office just watching it unfold in awe.

The memes flooding my feed facilitated so many trips to Chipotle at this point I’m convinced it was one of the greatest marketing schemes of all time. Adam not fully transforming into a Chipotle Bag has actually been surprising, I thought the Super Bowl was a career transition for him into the food industry! 
EDIT: Looking at this thread, it appears there are two camps of nacho. The other camp is the liquid queso camp. The nachos above are more like a pull-apart chewy cheese like you find on pizza. I guess the only way to settle the debate is to bring both to a Super Bowl party. </p>
