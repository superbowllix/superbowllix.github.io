        <p>The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. [1] 
It’s no surprise with how prestigious the Super Bowl Trophy is that no expense is cut in the process. Crafted entirely of sterling silver by Tiffany &amp; Co. silversmiths in a Rhode Island workshop, the Lombardi Trophy stands 22 inches high and weighs 7 pounds. The original trophy was produced by Tiffany &amp; Co. in New Jersey, but as of 2017, it  
Here’s how Tiffany &amp; Co. came to create the first-ever Super Bowl Trophy for the NFL in 1966, plus how it’s made year after year. 
The Lombardi Trophy is awarded annually to the winner of the Super Bowl, crowning that team as the NFL champion. It was first presented to the Green Bay Packers on Jan. 15, 1967, at the conclusion  
Though American football has been played since 1869, the first Super Bowl trophy was awarded nearly 100 hundred years later in 1967 when the Green Bay Packers, led by head coach Vince Lombardi, routed the Kansas City in Super Bowl I. Lombardi also won 2nd Super Bowl the following year as well against the Oakland Raiders. 
Since Super Bowl 45, the Vince Lombardi Trophy has been prominently featured in the Super Bowl logo design. The first trophy, inscribed with the words “World Professional Football Championship,” was awarded to the Green Bay Packers on January 15, 1967, after they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 1. 
The trophy received its official name ahead of Super Bowl V in 1971. It was named for legendary coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victory in the first two Super Bowls. 
Its story, intertwined with the evolution of the Super Bowl,  While winning the Super Bowl Trophy is often described as “priceless,” it costs approximately $50,000 to create each one. 
The Chiefs have grown quite familiar with the craftsmanship that goes into the formation of a Lombardi Trophy with two Super Bowl wins in the last four years. This year they've got another strong  
The Evolution of the Super Bowl Trophy Design. Over the years, the design of the Super Bowl Trophy has evolved to reflect the changing times and the growth of the NFL. Initially, the trophy featured a simple and elegant design, with a regulation-sized football made of sterling silver placed on a pedestal-style base. 
The 1969 Super Bowl was the third iteration of the championship tournament, and the first to bear the trademarked “Super Bowl” name. Going for an all-American red, white, and blue motif, the design featured the wordmark in two lines, with the word “SUPER” in the top line colored red, and the bottom “BOWL III” colored blue. 
Super Bowl Logo 2020. The Super Bowl 2020 logo stands out from all previous versions. It began a modernized design for the famous sports symbol and launched a new era, presenting the emblem as a dream prize that requires professional growth. This is conveyed primarily by the light shades of the trophy, shining like a polished treasure.
