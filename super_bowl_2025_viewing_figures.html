        <h2><strong>super bowl 2025 viewing figures starry super bowl commercial with ice spice</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl consistently ranks as one of the most-watched television events in the United States. According to Nielsen, last year’s Super Bowl drew an estimated 115.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched broadcast of the year. In comparison, the 2020 Super Bowl saw 99.9 million viewers, showing a strong upward trend in audience

Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four

Fox will air this year's Super Bowl and has "a chance" to deliver the most watched audience ever, said NFL Chief Media and Business Officer Brian Rolapp. 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
Thus removing out-of-home viewing from the equation puts this year’s games at a disadvantage compared to those of the past. Super Bowl ratings and viewership, all-time. As of 2021, out-of-home viewing is now included in traditional Nielsen-reported audience. * NBC’s 2022 streaming audience was 11.2 million viewers across 6.0 million devices. 
[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets  
Over the years, the Super Bowl has recorded figures of more than 100 million viewers in the United States, and more than 200 million around the world. The 2024 Super Bowl broke all records 
The price for placing commercials during the 2025 Super Bowl has not yet been reported, but for the 2024 game a 30-second spot on CBS cost around $7 million. 
Super Bowl LVIII’s combined UK TV audience of 3.4 million unique viewers broke the record for the NFL’s most prestigious game in 2024. One of its UK broadcasters, Sky Sports, reported 12.2m  
Nevertheless, the NFL objects to any unlicensed third-party advertising that refers to the Super Bowl.® For example, the use in advertising of taglines such as “Stock Up for the Super Bowl” for beer or snacks or “Get the Best View of the Super Bowl” for big-screen TVs has routinely led to the prompt issuance of cease-and-desist letters  
For the Super Bowl on Feb. 9 in New Orleans, the luxury hospitality and ticketing agency On Location sells packages that start at $7,050 per person and include a pregame party, open bar and a  
This year’s Super Bowl is expected to attract sports fans from across the country to Louisiana. Super Bowl LIX is scheduled to be played on February 9, 2025, at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, and will feature a rematch of Super Bowl LVII that will see the Kansas City Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles. Viewing Parties Attract Football Fans 
For the 2025 Super Bowl, CBS is the broadcaster, providing both traditional and online viewing options. The streaming aspect is significant since many people are moving away from cable subscriptions. Fortunately, CBS has partnered with its streaming service, Paramount+, which will be the main digital platform offering access to the Super Bowl. 
Given the value of the Super Bowl franchise, it is not surprising that the NFL is extremely aggressive in protecting its golden goose from anything it views as unauthorized efforts to trade off the goodwill associated with the mark or the game. Accordingly, with the coin toss almost upon us, advertisers should take special care before publishing or engaging in advertising or other promotional
