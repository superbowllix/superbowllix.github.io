        <h2><strong>super bowl qb for the ravens who won the super bowl cup 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Os quarterbacks que ganharam Super Bowls pelos Ravens foram Trent Dilfer e Joe Flacco. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Twenty-four quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. Seven of those quarterbacks have started at least one playoff game for the Ravens. These players are listed in order of the date of each player's first start at quarterback for the Ravens.

NFL.com ranked the best 66 quarterbacks to ever start a Super Bowl and two Baltimore Ravens landed on the list. Joe Flacco is the highest-ranked Raven at No. 49, followed by Trent Dilfer at No. 62. 
Last season, Jackson led the Ravens to their first AFC Championship Game since 2012, falling short at home to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, 17-10. All in all, Jackson’s playoff track record is less than stellar. He has completed a combined just 57.4% of his pass attempts for 1,324 yards, six touchdowns, and six  
Dilfer signed with the Ravens in 2000 as a backup before becoming the team's starter midway through the year, which concluded with the franchise's first Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl XXXV. Despite the championship, Dilfer was not re-signed by the Ravens, becoming the first starting quarterback to be released after a Super Bowl win. 
The Baltimore Ravens last won the Super Bowl in the 2012 season. The Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in the Super Bowl. 
That was when the Colts represented Charm City. Led by legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas, the Colts defeated the then-Oakland Raiders, 27-17. Now, 53 years later, Baltimore will hope for a long-awaited conference championship celebration  and a potential third Super Bowl parade after Feb. 11 for the Ravens. 
The Ravens and Giants squared off for Super Bowl XXXV on January 28, 2001 in Tampa, FL. The game pitted the league's two hottest teams against one another. 
Collins had a passer rating for the game of only 7.1, the second worst in Super Bowl history, [32] threw four interceptions (tying a Super Bowl record that has since been surpassed by Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon's five interceptions in Super Bowl XXXVII) and completed only 15 of 39 passes for 112 yards. Barber was the Giants' leading rusher  
Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is the first player to ever throw for more than 4,000 yards and rush for more than 800 yards in a season. Despite his impressive stats and on-field  
Joe Flacco, Tony Banks and Trent Dilfer are tied for the most career wins by a Ravens quarterback in Super Bowls, with 1 win.

Jackson would like to become the third Ravens quarterback to win a Super Bowl, following Trent Dilfer and Flacco. The journey begins next weekend, when Baltimore opens the playoffs at home in the wild-card round. 
The Baltimore Ravens have won 2 Super Bowls as they were crowned champions of the 2000 and 2012 NFL seasons. They defeated the Giants 34-7 in Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 and they beat the 49ers 34-31 in 2013 in Super Bowl XLVII.

The Ravens won their second Super Bowl (recount the Ravens first Super Bowl here), making them one of only two teams as of 2023 to go to multiple Super Bowls and win all of them. The other one will come up in a few months on this podcast, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. </p>
