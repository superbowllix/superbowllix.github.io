Super Bowl XLII was the championship game of professional football for the 2007 season, played on February 3, 2008, at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.[9] In one of the most significant upsets in Super Bowl history,[10] the NFC champion New York Giants (13-6), defeated the AFC champion New England Patriots (18-0), by the score of 17-14. Had the Patriots won this game, they  
Super Bowl XLII: Aftermath and Awards After three quarters, there were just ten points, and then this game turned into one of the greatest Super Bowl finishes ever.

Super Bowl XLII was also the second Super Bowl played in a retractable-roof stadium (the first was played at Reliant Stadium in Houston for Super Bowl XXXVIII).

Throughout the week leading up to Super Bowl XLII, the Giants were loose, the Patriots smooth yet practiced. For Brady, Moss, coach Bill Belichick, wideout Wes Welker, linebackers Tedy Bruschi and Junior Seau, this was another day at work.
