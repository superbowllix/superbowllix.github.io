        <h2><strong>super bowl odds by year super bowl commercial of jesus washing feet</strong></h2>
        <p>The smallest Super Bowl spread of the past two decades was Seattle -1 against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX; The largest Super Bowl spread over the past 20 years was New England -12 versus the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII; Recent Super Bowls have been closer contests, with three of the last four games decided by just a field  
For this year’s Super Bowl, the Kansas City Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites over the Philadelphia Eagles with a posted total of 48.5 points. The odds on the Super Bowl have been known to change, and there’s still a few days until the game. 
The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
The most infamous finale in Super Bowl history for oddsmakers was Super Bowl XIII and a lesson learned for all individuals standing behind the betting counter. The 13th installment saw the Steelers open as 4.5-point favorites over the Cowboys and the number dropped to 3.5 -points with early action on the Cowboys. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
Biggest Upset: The biggest upset in the Super Bowl was in Super Bowl III, when the New York Jets defeated the Baltimore Colts by a score of 16-7 as 17-point underdogs. Highest Total (Over/Under): The highest total (over/under) in the Super Bowl was 58.5 points in Super Bowl 58.5, when the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a  
The Super Bowl point spread involves the projected margin of victory.  Year Matchup Spread Bet Result; 2023: Chiefs v. Eagles:  Super Bowl 2025 Odds; NFL Schedule 2024-2025; 
Eagles Season and Super Bowl Betting History. ATS 13-7; Over 9-11; Super Bowl 2-1 ATS, Over 1-2; Super Trends of Yesteryear. The NFC once won 13 straight Super Bowls, starting with the Niners beating the Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX and ending when the Broncos upset the Packers as 11-point underdogs in Super Bowl XXXII 
Despite going into the 2021 season with 12-1 Super Bowl odds, Los Angeles became the largest pregame favorite at -200 odds to win the title. The Chiefs (+500) entered this season as the favorite

In last year's Super Bowl, I picked the Kansas City Chiefs to upset the San Francisco 49ers, and win by three points. That's exactly what happened.  Odds: Chiefs -1.5 O/U 48.5. 
The Kansas City Chiefs captured Super Bowl 58 and the team is listed as a +650 betting choice (Bet $100 to win $650) to three-peat in 2025. Here were the opening odds for which NFL team will win Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans later in 2025. 
Prior to their first postseason game against Houston, the Chiefs possessed +350 odds to win the Super Bowl and dropped to +240 prior to the AFC Championship. Regarding the Eagles, Philadelphia opened at +1600 to win Super Bowl LIX prior to the start of the regular season, an implied probability of 5.88%. Philadelphia’s biggest dip in Super  
Super Bowl favorites. The Chiefs (-124) and Eagles (+107) are only two teams remaining on the Super Bowl odds board. This year is a rematch from Super Bowl 57, which KC won 38-35. 
First Touchdown Scorer Odds for Super Bowl LIX. Philadelphia's Saquon Barkley (+410) has the shortest odds to score first, and he's followed closely by teammate Jalen Hurts (+600). After those two, we get three K.C. players with the next shortest odds between Travis Kelce (+800), Kareem Hunt (+900), and Xavier Worthy (+1000). 
Per Polymarket odds, Super Bowl LIX’s viewership is favored to land between 115 million and 120 million (+355). 120 million to 125 million (+376) is not out of the question, either. This year, the Super Bowl will air on Fox. 
The Kansas City Chiefs will meet the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59 on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans. Let's break down the 2025 Super Bowl odds with the big game just under a fortnight away. The Chiefs have the highest ticket % (12.6%) and handle % (16.8%) to win the Super Bowl per BetMGM.
