        <p>Super Bowl rings are crafted with real diamonds, but the number and quality vary depending on the team and the year. Learn how the rings are made, how much they cost, and how they reflect the team's identity and achievement. 
The first Super Bowl rings were awarded in 1966 to the Green Bay Packers. They featured a 0.5-carat diamond surrounded by white gold. The rings were designed by Packers head coach Vince Lombardi  
Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy substituted, with real diamonds surrounding the trophy, while the "C" level ring did not contain any diamonds. Per the CBA , players that were on the winning team's practice squad at the time of the Super Bowl victory are also entitled to a ring, but it can be one of lesser value. 
The Patriots’ Super Bowl LI rings featured 283 diamonds, which is not a random number—it reflects the 28 to 3 deficit the team overcame to beat the Atlanta Falcons, the largest comeback in  
These Super Bowl rings’ designs have become progressively exquisite, featuring a one-carat diamond at the outset but comprising over 250 10.5-carat diamonds and 36 rubies at the last Super Bowl. Originally, Super Bowl rings primarily featured gold and diamond materials until 2010, when the Green Bay Packers opted for a platinum-based set of  
Of course, the specific story on each year’s ring is always different. For example, the bezel of the Philadelphia Eagles ring for its Super Bowl LII victory depicts a single trick play known as the Philly Special through a “waterfall” of 127 diamonds, a number representing the total of the jersey numbers of the three players who executed it—running back Corey Clement (30), tight end  
Some 205 diamonds weighing 4.85 carats glittered in the NFL championship dazzler (the Patriot’s 2003 Super Bowl ring had 104 diamonds; the 2004 Super Bowl ring had 124 diamonds). Team owner Robert Kraft said he wanted this ring to outdo ones his earlier teams had received, and team officials proclaimed it was the “largest ring ever made.” 
The blingiest of bling, Super Bowl rings are typically made of yellow or rose gold and encrusted with diamonds. They usually include the team name, team logo, the phrase “World Champions”, and  
It also contained 16 rubies in the logo depicting the number of division titles won and 3 marquise cut diamonds embedded above, symbolizing the number of Super Bowl titles won by the team. 
The size and quality of the diamonds used in Super Bowl rings can vary. In the early years of the Super Bowl, the rings often featured a single, modestly-sized diamond. For example, the Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl I ring contained a single, half-carat diamond. Over time, however, the designs have become more extravagant and elaborate. 
The price tag for these rings is off the charts! A Super Bowl LI ring made for a family member of Tom Brady fetched a record-breaking $344,927 at auction despite having fewer diamonds and being smaller than Brady’s ring. Even before considering the sentimental significance, these rings are costly! 
Each ring is 16.1 total carats with over 600 diamonds and 35 custom-cut genuine rubies.  Can you buy a Super Bowl ring? Sure you can  if you have a cool $100,000 lying around. 
The genuine Super Bowl rings handed out to the victors are made with real gold and diamonds, boosting their value to thousands and thousands of dollars—and that's just for the ring itself. Pair that ring with a specific Super Bowl champion, and you could be looking at rings worth over $200,000 . 
The Patriots received their Super Bowl rings on Friday night, marking the fifth time the club finished the season as the NFL's best team. But unlike the previous four championship runs, this one  
Well, it for sure wasn't a player's or coach's ring. It doesn't have nearly enough diamonds. The team does allow it's employees to buy a cheaper version that is still considered official, though. Jostens also sells replica Super Bowl rings that are pretty much the same as the cheap ones that the team employees get, so there's probably not a good way to tell the difference wi 
The Los Angeles Rams have unveiled their Super Bowl LVI championship ring during a special Los Angeles ceremony with players, coaches and staff. The diamond-covered ring celebrates the Ram’s historic 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals at SoFi Stadium and is packed with details and symbolism that must be seen to believe. 
Why are the diamonds arranged a particular way? What do the inscriptions signify? Is there a reason for the number or shape of gems used? This collection of videos help explain the meanings behind the designs and what each team sought to commemorate with its Super Bowl ring. Super Bowl Rings (I - X)

Not for all the rings, but for each Super Bowl ring. The NFL puts $5,000 toward each ring for the first 150 and the team finances the rest. In some cases, it may come out of a player’s salary.
