        <p>There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. The closest they came to winning a Super Bowl was in 1991 and 2023 when they lost the Conference Championship. Detroit Lions Pages 
In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. The first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, so Detroit's championships do not count as Super Bowl  
The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships  
The Lions won four NFL Championship Games between 1935 and 1957. Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
The Lions last played for an NFL title in 1957, demolishing the Browns, 59-14 for the championship for the third time in the 1950s. The Lions also beat the Browns for the NFL title in 1952 and '53  
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. The Lions also lost the 1954 NFL Championship in their quest for a three-peat. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, the Detroit Lions have won the NFL Championship 4 times, most recently in the 1957 season. 
The Detroit Lions have not yet won a Super Bowl, as of December 2024. Get detailed information on Detroit Lions Super Bowl Appearances, their championships wins and much more on Sportskeeda. 
4-1 in pre-Super Bowl championships: Detroit does have championship history in football, but it has been 67 years. The Lions won their first championship in 1935 over the New York Giants. The  
Alex Chepeska, who got a tattoo claiming the Detroit Lions would be the 2024 Super Bowl Champs isn't worried they'll lose, but tells PEOPLE he has a plan in place, just in case 
The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX. 
This also remains as the Lions' fourth and most recent league title and most recent championship appearance (including the Super Bowl) as of 2024, starting a sixty-seven year championship drought for the Lions, which is currently the fourth-longest championship drought in the four major North American sports leagues. [13] 
The Super Bowl Drought. Since then, the Lions have had no championship or title. This is one of the longest droughts across all four major American sports. 66 years in the making, the Detroit Lions are poised to hang a banner up at Ford Field this season and capture their first-ever Super Bowl title. 
The 1952 NFL Championship Game was the 20th annual championship game, held on December 28 at Cleveland Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. [1] [2] [3] [4]The Detroit Lions (9–3) were the National Conference champions and met the Cleveland Browns (8–4), champions of the American Conference. 
Late in the first half of the Lions’ stunning 21-20 victory over the Super Bowl champion Chiefs in Kansas City on Thursday night, NBC showed a replay of the game’s first penalty of the  
By Justin Stulpe. The Detroit Lions are poised to make history this season, and it is time to believe the hype. Through the combination of strong leadership, a potent and explosive offense and a defense hitting its stride, the Lions are on the brink of unchartered territory in franchise history, aiming to win their first Super Bowl, and first pro football championship since 1957. 
The team earned the Vince Lombardi Trophy and a gold record in the same season. In 1985, on their way to an NFL championship, the Chicago Bears sold half a million copies of "The Super Bowl Shuffle" and just missed the Top 40, charting at #41. The thing is, members of the Detroit Lions football squad had recorded a song five years prior in 1980. 
Chepeska, 43, of Rochester Hills got a tattoo inked on his left upper arm in August that displays the Vince Lombardi trophy, along with the Lions logo and the words, "SUPER BOWL CHAMPS 2024." This  
But, they have no Super Bowl wins. Understanding the Lions’ journey is key. They have faced many challenges in their quest for a championship.
