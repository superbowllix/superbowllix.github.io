        <p>SUPER BOWL LVIII. What time did the Super Bowl end? The NFL championship game was one of just two Super Bowls to go to overtime and the Chiefs secured a famous victory at the death. 
Super Bowl XLVII, played on February 3, 2013, between the Ravens and the 49ers, lasted for 3 hours and 34 minutes in regular time. However, the game featured a 34-minute pause due to a power  
There are also lots of commercial breaks during the Super Bowl, with the prime-time TV slot featuring over 100 adverts! In 2025, the estimated cost of a 30-second ad spot for Super Bowl LIX will  
Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar Bowl), and El Paso (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton Bowl) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term "bowl" for any major American football game was well  
Sunday's game will be the first Super Bowl since February 2021 at which "End Racism" will not be in an end zone stencil. "The Super Bowl is often a snapshot in time and the NFL is in a unique  
This obviously impacted what time the Super Bowl finished as well. This past season’s Super Bowl ended at 10:14 p.m. ET.

Super Bowl start time Eastern: 6:30 p.m. ET; SB start time Central: 5:30 p.m. CT 
How Long Is the Super Bowl Game? Let’s look at a stretch during the 2010s to get an inkling of the total length of Super Bowl 57 (year denotes Super Bowl year, not the year of the regular season). 2010: Three hours and 42 minutes 2011: Three hours and 53 minutes 2012: Three hours and 23 minutes 2013: Four hours and 15 minutes 
This year’s Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans will start at 5:30 pm local (Central Time), so those on the East Coast will want to be ready to watch for a 6:30 pm local kick-off, Mountain Time Super Bowl kick-off is at 4:30, and those on the west coast will be able to tune in and catch kick off at 3:30 pm local time. 
The Super Bowl, of course, is set to kickoff at 6:30 p.m. ET. Championship games across professional sports (and at the college level) in the United States tend to start later than the time indicated. 
Super Bowl XXXVI : Adam Vinatieri kicked a 48-yard goal as time expired to give the Patriots a 20-17 victory over the St. Louis Rams. When the Rams tied the score at 17-17 in the final minute  
Super Bowl XLVII between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers did not go into overtime, but the game was extended by a bizarre interruption. Early in the third quarter the power went  
But, yes, it’s true: “End Racism” will be absent from Super Bowl LIX. In its place will be “Choose Love.” According to Silver, this will be the first time the “End Racism” slogan  
Dennis Deninger, who spent 25 years as an ESPN production executive and now teaches a Super Bowl course at Syracuse University, said that's because the NFL and the networks that air its games want  
What Time Does the Super Bowl End? Editor's note: This story originally ran Feb. 3, 2019. Sports Illustrated is republishing it with updates ahead of Super Bowl 59. 
LAS VEGAS — The NFL has a repeat champion for the first time in 19 years. The Kansas City Chiefs, with a third Super Bowl triumph in five seasons, cemented the league’s modern-day dynasty with  
Super Bowl LVII takes place on Sunday, Feb. 12, in Glendale, Arizona. Here's what time you can expect the national anthem, kickoff, and Rihanna's halftime show. 
For the first time since February 2021, the “End Racism” message stencil will not appear across the end zone of the Super Bowl. Instead, “Choose Love” will be featured along one of the end  
For the first time since February 2021, “End Racism” will not appear in the end zone during a Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 9, as the NFL plans to replace it with two different phrases. 
The game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles will mark the first time since February 2021 that “End Racism” is not included as a message in the back of a Super Bowl end  </p>
