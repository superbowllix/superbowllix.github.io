        <p>(Market-leading QB salaries have only escalated over the years, but so too has the NFL's cap, save for the 2020 pandemic-affected season.)  Only one QB since 1994 has won a Super Bowl with a  
A real-time, sortable list of NFL contracts including total value, guaranteed money, and complete salary breakdowns. All Signed Years 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 
The Highest Cap Percentages to Reach a Super Bowl. Going back to the year 2000, the QB who reached the Super Bowl with the highest percentage of league salary cap is Peyton Manning, whose $23.2M cap hit in 2009 represented 18.8% of the league cap. The Saints beat the Colts that year. Top 10 Super Bowl QB Cap Percentages. 2009: Peyton Manning  
The average spend on a Super Bowl QB has been just 6.4%. If Brady wins the Super Bowl his cap percentage will fit between the Manning brothers at 11.1%. Russell Wilson’s 0.49% would rank below all others except for Brady in 2001 who cost just 0.47% of the Patriots salary cap. 
Purdy would earn the standard $164,000 Super Bowl bonus all players would receive for winning the championship. Meanwhile, Goff would take in $945,000 and Mahomes would earn $1.3 million  
On the flip side, no QB with a cap percentage over 13.1% had ever won a Super Bowl – until this past season. Mahomes’ cap hit was a massive 17.16% of the team total, way more than the 13.1% of Steve Young in the very first year of the cap (under a contract that was signed before a cap existed). 
The amount players get paid for winning the Super Bowl is the same regardless of their contract. As with every playoff round, the stars on huge contracts get the same pay as everyone else on the roster. The NFL sets that number, and the payouts depend on if a team wins or loses.

Mahomes signed a 10-year, $450 million extension with the Chiefs in July 2020, just about five months after the quarterback led Kansas City to a Super Bowl 54 win over the San Francisco 49ers.

Every player who wins the Super Bowl will get a $171,000 bonus from the NFL. Some stars will also get bonuses from their team of up to an additional. $1.5 million. The Kansas City Chiefs and the  
It plans to have event contracts available in all 50 states through Kalshi, saying they “leverage the power and rigor of the financial market structure to facilitate greater liquidity, transparency, and price discovery.” The partnership furthers Kalshi’s rapid movement in getting Super Bowl wagers via event contracts available to the public. 
Since the inception of rookie contracts as we know them today, only 2 of 11 Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks were on rookie contracts at that time. Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.

Super Bowl Losing QBs: 6/12 on rookie deal 1/12 5th-year option 4/12 &gt; 10% of the cap (1 in last 6 years) Does having a QB on a rookie deal allow for better roster construction? Absolutely. But you know what trumps a better roster? A franchise QB. We can quit worrying that paying Jalen Hurts closes the Super Bowl window. 
Super Bowl LVIII features a polarizing QB matchup of polar opposites. Brock Purdy was the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft and is fighting for his first ring as one of the greatest underdog  
Detroit has former No. 1 pick (2016) and Super Bowl QB Jared Goff entrenched as their starter. Bridgewater can still operate as a sounding board and go-between with the coaching staff. 
In the modern NFL, having a quarterback on his rookie contract pays huge dividends.  Joe Flacco, and Jimmy Garoppolo are the other Super Bowl quarterbacks since the 2011 CBA’s inception. 
Quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts are competing Sunday as their teams vie for the Super Bowl championship title. FOX Business takes a look at their contracts. 
The assumption that a team is in their “Super Bowl window” while their quarterback is on a rookie deal can simply be dismissed by this century’s Super Bowl winning quarterbacks. Since 2000, there have been only 9 of a total 23 Super Bowl winning quarterbacks to win the big game on a rookie deal. </p>
