The 2023 Super Bowl (Super Bowl LVII) will be Sunday, Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona

How is the home team determined for the Super Bowl? Although the Super Bowl is played on a neutral site, the two conference representatives are still designated as home and away teams. The home

How Does the NFL Determine the Home Team in the Super Bowl? It’s a question many are curious about, and the answer is simple. As you all know, the Super Bowl occurs annually in February. The two participating teams, one from each respective conference, alternate between the home and road side each season. Yes, it’s that simple. 
In 58 editions of the Super Bowl, this phenomenon has only happened twice, and this gave rise to the “Super Bowl Curse”. The teams whose stadiums are picked for a Super Bowl usually miss the playoffs or are knocked out early in the postseason. No team whose stadium hosted the Super Bowl reached the Super Bowl until 2020. Another fun fact is

The AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs were the home team in Super Bowl 58 last February, so as the NFC champions, the Philadelphia Eagles are the designated home team in Super Bowl 59 on February 9, 2025. 
The NFL determines the home team in the Super Bowl by alternating each year between the AFC and NFC champions. This simple rotation ensures fairness.

How Is a Super Bowl Team Determined? NFL standings during the regular season are a good place to start since only the premier teams earn berths in the postseason. As the NFL currently has a 17-game schedule, it’s not unrealistic to suggest a team would need to win at least 10 games to qualify.
