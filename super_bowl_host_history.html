        <h2><strong>super bowl host history kansas city chiefs super bowl post game</strong></h2>
        <p>Through Super Bowl LVI, teams were allowed to bid for the rights to host Super Bowls, where cities submitted proposals to host a Super Bowl and were evaluated in terms of stadium renovation and their ability to host, but this competition was rescinded in 2018. 
Throughout history, 26 different stadiums in 17 major cities (or their environs) have played host. Miami holds the record for the most Super Bowl games with 11. 
Here is a list of the cities which have hosted the Super Bowl. See also the list of Super Bowl winners listed by year.

Host With The Most. New Orleans may not have much history playing in the Super Bowl, but we have an impressive history of hosting it. In fact, with the addition of Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, the Super Bowl has been played in New Orleans 11 times. 
When you look at the list of Super Bowl host cities, you can see one very common theme – most of these cities are in warm climate areas.

New Orleans is close to tying this record, as it will host Super Bowl 59, which will bring its total to 11. Los Angeles follows with eight Super Bowls hosted. Super Bowl locations and winners by year: 
New Orleans hosted its first Super Bowl on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in front of a crowd of nearly 81,000. Led by Head Coach Hank Stram, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in the last-ever championship between the NFL and AFL before the two leagues merged. 
Los Angeles hosted the first Super Bowl in 1967 and the last time was 1993, when we saw the Dallas Cowboys defeat the Buffalo Bills at the Rose Bowl. We are thrilled to welcome back the NFL’s big game – and the celebration that surrounds it – to the Los Angeles region in 2022 for the first Super Bowl at the new SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.
