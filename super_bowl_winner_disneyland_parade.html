The Disneyland Super Bowl Parade will take place on Monday, February 12, celebrating the winner of Super Bowl LVIII.

Disneyland has announced that the winner of Super Bowl LVIII will be celebrated at the Disneyland Resort on Monday, February 12, 2024. If you’ve ever been at a Disney theme park on the Monday following Super Bowl Sunday, you’ll know that this is typically a quick presentation where the game’s MVP rides down the parade route on a special  
Disneyland usually hosts the parade when the Super Bowl site is located on the West Coast. This year it’s in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Walt Disney World plays host to the cavalcade when the big game is on the East Coast or South. This will mark the third year in a row that the Super Bowl winners have gone to Disneyland. In 2023, the game was in

Last year’s game took place in Los Angeles, making the decision to celebrate the winner in Disneyland an obvious choice. This year’s game is taking place in Phoenix, which is still much closer to Disneyland than Walt Disney World. Next year, the Super Bowl will be in Las Vegas, making Disneyland a likely destination once again. 
The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will face off in Las Vegas on Sunday, February 11. It’s a tradition for the Super Bowl winners to then visit Disneyland or Walt Disney World.
