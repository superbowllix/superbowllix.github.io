A quarterback has taken home MVP honors in 32 of the 58 Super Bowls. The position with the second-most Super Bowl MVPs is wide receiver, at eight. Here’s a full breakdown of Super Bowl MVP  
Cooper Kupp was the most recent recipient of the Super Bowl MVP award for his outstanding play at Wide Receiver. Without Cooper Kupp, there is virtually zero chance that the Rams beat the Bengals. He was the best player in the league this year, performing far superior to everyone, including actual MVP, Aaron Rodgers.

So it seems only appropriate that the Super Bowl MVP here was the Cowboys' Chuck Howley, whose team lost 16–13 to the Baltimore Colts. Howley refused to accept it, citing the meaninglessness of  
He was the first quarterback to throw for more than 4,000 yards and rush for more than 800 as he totaled 5,087 yards. He had the fourth-highest passer rating of all time, finishing at 119.6. 
How Many Super Bowl MVPs Does Tom Brady Have? With five Super Bowl MVP trophies, it’s no surprise that the GOAT has been the most valuable player more times than anyone else. Brady has won a record seven Super Bowls (2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021). The first time Brady was named Super Bowl MVP was in 2002. 
Super Bowl LIII marked the only other time Tom Brady wasn’t named the MVP of a Super Bowl he won, as that honor went to Julian Edelman.

The two teams combined for a Super Bowl record 11 turnovers, with five recorded in the fourth quarter alone. The Colts’ seven turnovers remain the most committed by a Super Bowl champion. Dallas also set a Super Bowl record with 10 penalties, costing them 133 yards. 
The Super Bowl is by far the biggest stage in sports. More than 90 million people tune in to watch the final game of the NFL season each year. That means that all eyes are on the two teams that face off, which happen to be the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles in this year's showdown. 
A total of 10 defensive players have won Super Bowl MVP honors in nine Super Bowls.  The Cowboys won Super Bowl VI and Super Bowl XII and lost Super Bowl V, Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIII.
