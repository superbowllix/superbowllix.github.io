        <h2><strong>super bowl parade disney what day does super bowl come on</strong></h2>
        <p>The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom. 
The last few years of the Super Bowl parade have been at Disneyland in California. This year after the day of the game, the Super Bowl parade will take place at Disney World on Monday, February 10, 2025. Disney World has now confirmed through its Instagram story that the parade will occur on this day. There will typically be a short  
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles go head-to-head in New Orleans this Sunday, February 9th. The winning team from the NFL’s annual Super Bowl game is usually celebrated at Walt Disney World with the Most Valuable Player (MVP) being part of the iconic “I’m going to Disney World!” commercial, before starring in a parade down Main Street U.S.A. 
Mahomes appeared in the victory parade with Disney characters in Disneyland Park. The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a parade at Walt Disney World was in 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade on Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. 
While Disney has not yet announced an exact time for the parade, it is traditionally held in the early afternoon. This long-standing tradition dates back to Super Bowl XXI in 1987, when Phil Simms of the New York Giants first delivered the now-famous line. 
Walt Disney World has announced that they will host the celebratory Super Bowl LIX parade this year on Monday, February 10, 2025. This covers when you can expect to see the cavalcade, players you can expect to see, along with viewing tips and our past experiences watching Super Bowl parades at WDW and Disneyland. The [] 
Walt Disney World Hosting Super Bowl LIX Parade. The parade will take place at Magic Kingdom as players from the winning team ride down Main Street USA. An exact time for the parade has not yet been announced. Super Bowl LIX features the Kansas City Chiefs vs the Philadelphia Eagles and it will air on Fox starting at 6:30pm ET on Sunday  
I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information from the Disney playbook. I just spoke to an MVP of a Cast Member who confirmed that, at the time of this writing, no official announcement has been made about the Super Bowl parade. However, this Cast Member also told me that a Super Bowl parade generally occurs the day after the big  
It has become a beloved tradition for the Super Bowl MVP—or sometimes a group of key players from the winning team—to head to a Disney park for a victory parade. In recent years, the location has leaned toward Disneyland due to the proximity of the Super Bowl being played in Las Vegas, Arizona, and California. 
The 58th annual Super Bowl will be held on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Walt Disney World guests can watch the Super Bowl from the comfort of their in-room TVs or visit a variety of locations across Walt Disney World property, including many bars and lounges at Disney Springs and at Walt Disney World resorts.

Super Bowl Parade – Possibly Feb. 10, 2025 – Normally, the day after the Super Bowl, the Super Bowl MVP parades down Main Street, U.S.A. at Magic Kingdom or Disneyland. Since the Super Bowl is taking place in New Orleans, it is likely that the champs will head to Disney World. Hollywood Studios 
Super Bowl Sunday is wrapping up, and fans watching have grown to anticipate this phrase at the end of the game: “I'm going to Disneyland!” or “I'm going to Disney World!” The Disneyland Super Bowl Parade featured a celebration of the winner of Super Bowl LVIII after the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs faced off. 
While Disney hasn’t officially shared what time the parade will be taking place, the calendar shows 12 PM and 3 PM as the current times for the Festival of Fantasy Parade, so it’s possible the Super Bowl Parade will replace one of these. 
At this time, Disney World has not announced what time the festivities will kick off. We do know, however, that the Super Bowl winners participate in a parade at Magic Kingdom. So, be sure to check back with MickeyBlog. We will continue to update you on all the Super Bowl festivities as they are revealed. Thanks for visiting MickeyBlog.com! 
Just like the iconic commercial would have you believe, players from the winning Super Bowl team typically make their way to either Disney World or Disneyland for the Super Bowl parade, and this year, it’s taking place in Disney World! 
The Super Bowl and Disney parks have had a pop culture connection for decades. How did the NFL tradition begin?  the chosen player usually takes part in a parade at either Disneyland or Disney  
2) Parade. Google is failing me. Anytime I google Super Bowl Parade Disney it gives me info on past parades, mostly in Disneyland. This year, with SB in New Orleans, I think it will be at Disney World. Why is this info so top secret??? I suspect it'll be Monday. What time? Looking for educated guesses. Maybe 11 am? Thanks all! 
If we look back in the playbooks though, Naomi, the Super Bowl Parade typically happens the day after the Super Bowl at Magic Kingdom before the regularly scheduled 3pm Festival of Fantasy Parade. The Disney Super Bowl Parade's kickoff is usually kept under wraps to keep the magic -- which makes this offering a nice surprise! </p>
