        <h2><strong>super bowl wins do the 49ers have super bowl overtime promo</strong></h2>
        <p>The 49ers will make their eighth appearance in the Super Bowl. The franchise has a record of 5-2 all time in championship games, but enters the weekend on a two-game losing streak in the Super Bowl. 
The 49ers have tasted victory in the Super Bowl five times. Below is a quick review of all five of their Super Bowl wins. Super Bowl 16: 49ers 26, Bengals 21; 
The San Francisco 49ers are back in the Super Bowl for the third time since the 2012 season, but they’re seeking their first championship since 1994. 
The San Francisco 49ers are one of the most successful franchises in NFL history. The 49ers have won five Super Bowl championships and are appearing in pro football's ultimate game for an eighth  
How many 49ers have been named Super Bowl MVP? Three different 49ers have been named Super Bowl MVP. QB Joe Montana was named MVP in three of San Francisco’s first four Super Bowl wins, becoming the first player in NFL history to win three Super Bowl MVPs. Montana’s three Super Bowl MVPs are now the 2nd-most of any player (Tom Brady won five). 
The 49ers have won the Super Bowl fives times, one less than the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers who hold the record with six. When was the last San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl win? The 49ers last won the Super Bowl in 1995, the 75 points and 10 touchdowns scored in that win over the San Diego Chargers both remain the highest  
The San Francisco 49ers took on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII, but the game did not have the outcome Niners fans hoped for. Take a look back on how many wins and appearances the team  
The 49ers have two of the most dominant Super Bowl wins coming with a 55-10 win over John Elway and the Denver Broncos in the 1989 season. The 55 points scored are still a Super Bowl record and the 45-point win is also the biggest win margin in history. 
The San Francisco 49ers have won five Super Bowls in seven appearances. Their first Super Bowl win was in 1982 (Super Bowl XVI). The team won all of their Super Bowl matches in the 1980s and 1990s  
After winning the Super Bowl in one of the most dramatic finishes one year earlier, the 49ers captured Super Bowl No. 4 with the largest blowout in the championship’s history, beating the Denver Broncos, 55-10. The 55 points were a Super Bowl record, as was the 45-point margin of victory. 
How Many Super Bowl Wins Do the Ravens Have? (Flacco led the Ravens to an SB win during the 2012 season. Photo: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports) The Baltimore Ravens have won 2 Super Bowls as they were crowned champions of the 2000 and 2012 NFL seasons. 
The 49ers won Super Bowl 16, Super Bowl 19, Super Bowl 23, Super Bowl 24, Super Bowl 29 and lost Super Bowl 47 and Super Bowl 54.  Steve Young's 49ers defeated the San Diego Chargers 49-26 in  
Super Bowl XLVII: 49ers 31 Baltimore Ravens 34. Super Bowl MVP: Joe Flacco. All the 49ers had to do to win their sixth Super Bowl and be 6-0 all-time when the chips are down was win the Harbaugh Bowl.

49ers’ Super Bowl Wins. This year marks the 49ers’ eighth Super Bowl appearance, which is tied for the 2nd-most by any team in NFL history. San Francisco will join the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Cowboys, and Denver Broncos with eight Super Bowl appearances, while only the Patriots have played in more (11). 
The San Francisco 49ers took on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII, but the game did not have the outcome Niners fans hoped for. Take a look back on how many wins and appearances the team  
How many times have the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots have won a total of 6 Super Bowls, in 2001, 2003-2004, 2014, 2016 and 2018. 
The viral moment Kittle was referring to was during the 2024 Super Bowl, when the Chiefs took on the 49ers and the Chiefs missed out on scoring after a player fumbled. 
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. 
What's the 49ers's record in Super Bowl games? The NFC West franchise is 5-2 in its Super Bowl appearances. The 49ers won Super Bowl 16, Super Bowl 19, Super Bowl 23, Super Bowl 24, Super Bowl 29  </p>
