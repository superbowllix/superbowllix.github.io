        <h2><strong>super bowl detroit silverdome jokes about super bowl</strong></h2>
        <p>This was the only Super Bowl to be played at the Pontiac Silverdome. The Super Bowl did return to Michigan for Super Bowl XL, but that game was played at Ford Field in Detroit, which in 2002 had replaced the Silverdome as the home of the Detroit Lions. This was also only the second Super Bowl to not take place in one of the three so-called 'big  
The Silverdome hosted the Detroit Lions of the NFL (1975–2001), the Detroit Pistons of the NBA (1978–1988), the Detroit Express (for both outdoor and indoor soccer) of the NASL (1978–1980), the Michigan Panthers of the USFL (1983–1984), college football's Cherry Bowl (1984–1985), the Motor City Bowl (1997–2001), the MHSAA football state finals (1976–2004) and four first-round  
Despite its relatively short existence, the Silverdome had its fair share of memorable moments over the decades. The home of the Lions from 1975-2001, it also housed the NBA's Detroit Pistons from 1978-1988, the defunct NASL's Detroit Express from 1978-1980, and the defunct USFL's Michigan Panthers from 1983-1984. 
San Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh is carried off the field by his players after his team wins Super Bowl XVI, the first of the 49ers' five championships, on January 24, 1982 at the Silverdome  
Based in Pontiac, Michigan, the Silverdome was the home of the Lions, showcasing NFL games on a regular basis while it hosted the Super Bowl, a pope, the NBA finals, Led Zeppelin, Elvis, WrestleMania and dozens of other world-class acts and sporting events. However, in 2002, the Silverdome was cast aside by the Lions in favor of Ford Field. 
Thirty-four years ago, the Silverdome hosted Super Bowl XVI and the 49ers began their decade of dominance. With the Detroit stadium now in ruins, let’s look back at how San Francisco began its  
Super Bowl XVI was the first Super Bowl to play in a northern location or a cold-weather city. The game was played at the Pontiac Silverdome just outside of Detroit, which means the weather would  
For Super Bowl XVI, the NFL decided to do something different, move the game to a cold weather city, to the Pontiac Silverdome, home of the Detroit Lions. Prior to moving into the Silverdome, the Detroit Lions had played at Tiger Stadium since 1938, that was also the home of the Detroit Tigers (MLB). 
The Lions first few years at the Silverdome were mixed, managing only three winning seasons between 1975 and 1982, but the stadium was a popular draw. The profile of the Silverdome and the City of Detroit were raised in 1982 when the stadium hosted Super Bowl XVI between the San Francisco 49ers and the Cincinnati Bengals. 
In its time, it not only hosted the Lions, but the Detroit Pistons from 1978 to 1988, the Detroit Express soccer team and the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League. A Motor City Bowl and Cherry Bowl took place inside the dome, as did the 1979 NBA All-Star Game, FIFA World Cup games and more. 
Detroit has hosted two Super Bowls  one at the Pontiac Silverdome and one at Ford Field. 1) January 24, 1982 - Super Bowl XVI played at the Pontiac Silverdome. The San Francisco 49ers defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 26-21. 2) February 5, 2006 - Super Bowl XL played at Ford Field. The Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21-10. 
The fabled Silverdome, host to NBA and NFL games, the Super Bowl, and matches during the 1994 FIFA World Cup, now lies demolished, as reported by Historic Vids. The inaugural game at this stadium took place in 1975. Initially constructed as the exclusive home arena for the once illustrious Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). 
The Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan was home to the Detroit Lions from 1975-2001 and the Detroit Pistons, from 1978-1988. When it opened in 1975 it held the largest number of seats, 82,666, of any National Football League (NFL) stadium until it was surpassed in 2000.
