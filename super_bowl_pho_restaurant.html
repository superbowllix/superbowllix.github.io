Was in the area on the lookout for vietnamese food. My boyfriend and I saw Pho Super Bowl so he turned the car around. The service here is superb - friendly, fast, and superb!

The name sounded like NFL of Pho or something. I had to try Pho Super Bowl to see how big their food was. I ordered Lemongrass Pork with 2 Spring Rolls on Vermicelli ($19.75) it was big enough for 2 servings. And yes, this place is like NFL version of Pho it's gigantic! I was freaking out at the portion when it first came.

We had the Vietnamese spring roll (goi cuon) but they were mediocre though. They put too much veggies inside and we could not taste the meat. And I wish the beef could be medium well but they were all well done. The pho (soup noodles) was tasty. Service was okay and price was very reasonable. I'm craving for a hot bowl of pho now. 
Pho Tai - I personally think the pho was fine. It was a standard pho, what you would expect out of a pho place, though my wife wasn't a huge fan. The price is fair for pho in the area, though if you want to pay a bit more, there's better pho in the city. Price to value, this is ok.
