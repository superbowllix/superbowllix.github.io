        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games.

The average age of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is 30.71 years of age. Over the course of NFL history that seems to fit with what one would think of as the prime of a quarterback’s career. 
Elway won his first Super Bowl at age 37, then won a second straight at 38, before calling it a career.  The seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback has racked up more Super Bowl wins than  
Super Bowl QB Age: The Rarity of Twentysomething QBs. Super Bowl 57 marks only the 12th time the NFL title game has featured two starting QBs in their 20s, accounting for merely 21% of contests. In fact, it happened only twice in the first 29 Super Bowls.

HOFers Named Super Bowl MVP 23 members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame have earned Most Valuable Player honors in a Super Bowl. Three of them -- Bart Starr (2), Terry Bradshaw (2), and Joe Montana (3) -- have earned the award more than once. 
The oldest quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl is Tom Brady. He won Super Bowl 55 at 43 years of age when his Buccaneers beat the Chiefs, 31-9, in February 2021. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
A fourth Super Bowl win would tie Mahomes with Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the second-most Super Bowl wins by a quarterback. Mahomes' 17 postseason wins are already the  
Super Bowl LIX will see a rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. Chiefs' quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, hopes to secure a fourth Super Bowl MVP title, while Eagles' Jalen Hurts seeks redemption after a pivotal mistake in last year's game. Both quarterbacks bring unique skills and aspirations to the showdown. 
Brady could've been on this list three separate times as he has won a Super Bowl at ages 39, 41, and his latest at age 43, making him the oldest player to ever win the Super Bowl. The seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback has racked up more Super Bowl wins than any franchise has in history. 
The youngest starting quarterbacks in Super Bowl history all accomplished a remarkable feat, reaching the biggest stage in sports at an age when many other NFL stars are still developing their skill sets. Dan Marino is still the youngest quarterback to start the Super Bowl in history at the age of

Records Set by Super Bowl Winning QBs. Winning Super Bowls often comes with the chance to set new records. Some of the most notable achievements by Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks include: Most TD Passes in a Super Bowl – Steve Young with 6 TDs in Super Bowl XXIX. Youngest QB to Win – Ben Roethlisberger, at age 23, in Super Bowl XL. 
In 1998, Elway came back to play his final NFL season at age 38. In Super Bowl XXXIII against the Falcons, he completed 18-of-29 for 336 yards, one TD pass and one interception, adding a rushing  
Mahomes, a three-time Super Bowl Champion and three-time Super Bowl MVP, will play in his fifth Super Bowl on Sunday, the most ever for a quarterback under the age of 30. His only loss, as noted  
Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels could join Patrick Mahomes as one of the youngest starting quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl.  Age: 26 years, 5 months, and 29 days old. </p>
