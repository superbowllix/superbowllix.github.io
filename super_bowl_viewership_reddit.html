        <p>The Feb. 11 Super Bowl game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers brought in an average of 123.4 million viewers ‚Äî the highest number of people watching the same broadcast in the history of television. 112 million of those viewers were tuned into the CBS broadcast ‚Äî the largest audience ever for a single network. 
Super Bowl LVIII raked in an audience of 123.4M viewers on CBS, Nickelodeon, Univision, and digital platforms including NFL+. That‚Äôs up 7% from last year‚Äôs record-breaking audience of 115.1M on Fox, according to Nielsen data. CBS led the way with 120M watching on the broadcast network alone, marking the largest audience in history for a

Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched program in television history, with an average of 123.7 million viewers tuning in to the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win versus the 49ers. 
2014: FOX said Super Bowl XLVIII had a streaming average minute audience of 528,000 viewers and peak concurrent viewership of 1.1 million, with users spending an average of 47.8 minutes watching the stream. 2013: CBS Sports said Super Bowl XLVII had a streaming average minute audience of 508,000 with an average viewing time of 38 minutes.

The Super Bowl on Sunday drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers who watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in a nail-biting overtime triumph, CBS Sports said in a  
The 2025 viewership numbers most closely align with those of 2023, with Conference Championships drawing about 1.3% more viewers, Divisional Round viewership up 0.8%, and Wild Card \viewership  
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Global Super Bowl  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
"The Super Bowl is watched by an average of just under 100 million viewers in the US, with another 30-50 million tuning in from other countries." "The Champions League final usually attracts between 380 and 400 million viewers who tune in outside the stadium where the game is played."

I haven't been able to find a proper figure as to the difference between the worldwide viewership between these two events. The best i've found is that Superbowl had 111million viewers this time and the Champions league had 300million. 
Indeed it was not a great football game, but no one knew that for the first hour. I think a lot of LoL fans just chose LCS over Super Bowl. Me, I watched the Super Bowl live and TSM vs C9 right after, just like you, and it was great. I'm very grateful to LoLeventVoDs and to Riot for uploading the games so quickly. 
Missing the point. I'm talking about the Super Bowl versus the World Series. Sure. Ads on jerseys and all over the outfield are obnoxious, but the game remains the same all year. The Super Bowl is watered down and becomes about everything surrounding it. Pageantry, performances, and big names. 
[Meirov] Numbers are in: Super Bowl LVI featuring the Rams and Bengals was watched by 112.3 million viewers across all platforms. That‚Äôs up 14% over last year‚Äôs Super Bowl. The NFL finishes a strong season with another massive number. What a year.üèà üëë 
Na, Australia was just the biggest viewers per capita of Eurovision outside of Europe. Then as a special event, the Eurovision organisers decided to let us compete for one year. Then they got lazy and forgot to kick us out.

The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. 
The NFL gives teams $4,000 for each Super Bowl ring, and team owners spend their own money to improve them. The rings Chicago Bears players received from the McCaskey family for Super Bowl XX cost $4,000. </p>
