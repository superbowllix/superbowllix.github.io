Putting the iconic "I'm going to Disney" commercial together in the minutes after the game ends doesn't look like the easiest job in  
Mahomes’ three Super Bowl MVP honors equal the three earned by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, who was honored after the team’s titles in 1982, 1983 and 1990. 
The phrase has been uttered by the game’s MVP or a significant contributor to the win every year since except for Super Bowl XXXIX. Disney put the campaign on hiatus that season (2005), but it  
That’s where the idea of promoting it for the Super Bowl came from. Walt Disney met with NFL organizers, and they reached an agreement for the most valuable player to say the phrase after the game. 
Since Simms became the first Super Bowl MVP to go to Disney in 1987, at least one player has uttered the line in all but one year (2005), when there was no commercial following Super Bowl XXXIX. It was a brief hiatus for the campaign, which has continued every year in the nearly two decades since.

Since 1987, the entertainment giant has regularly tapped top performers from the winning Super Bowl team to declare “I’m going to Disney World!” after the win. Recent participants in the  
Following Super Bowl XXV in 1991, OJ Anderson the games MVP was given the option to say the traditional I'm going to Walt Disney World or to dedicate the win for the troops due to the Gulf War. Anderson chose the latter. 
At the end of almost every Super Bowl game since 1987, Disney has aired an ad featuring star players from the championship team enthusiastically proclaiming that they're going to a Disney theme  
The "I'm going to Disney!" tradition didn't start until Super Bowl 21 in 1987. Twice in history there was no Disney theme park celebration in Orlando or Anaheim for the winning Super Bowl team.

“I’m going to Disney World!” and “I’m going to Disneyland!” have solidified their spots in the cultural consciousness thanks to the Super Bowl. These phrases, often exclaimed post-game with different commercials airing based on regional locations, have been commonly uttered by non-Super Bowl champions since their debut in 1987. 
Walt Disney World has announced that they will host the Super Bowl Super Bowl LIX this year with the event being held in New Orleans. The parade will be on Monday, February 10th and it traditionally features the MVP of the Super Bowl.
