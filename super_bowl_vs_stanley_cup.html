        <p>In addition to that, in the nearly 100 years since the first Stanley Cup was won, only eight teams have ever won back-to-back championships. On the other hand, there are seven NFL teams that have taken home consecutive Super Bowl titles, but over 40 fewer years. 
This most recently happened in 2021 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV and Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2021 Stanley Cup, their second in a row. [1] Like with single season championships, New York City is the only city to win multiple titles in back-to-back calendar years, doing so in 1927 and 1928. [2] 
The Super Bowl features one of the most iconic prizes in sports: the Vince Lombardi Trophy.  The Stanley Cup is not recreated each year but is inscribed with the names of each player on the  
From Super Bowl XL to Super Bowl LIII, and again since Super Bowl LVIII, a former NFL player, usually a past Super Bowl MVP or notable figure of the host city's franchise, brought the Lombardi Trophy to the center of the stadium, as he walked past members of the winning team. Players who have partaken in Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremonies  
The Super Bowl is overrated. The Stanley Cup Finals are better. Allow me to explain so we all understand. In case you aren't sitting on the NFL's balls or just "watch for the commercials", the Super Bowl is Sunday. Kickoff is at 5:18 in the evening, or something weird and stupid. 
I feel like it's apples and oranges to compare these two. For starters, the Super Bowl is one game, while the Stanley Cup final can be up to 7 games. As such, for the Super Bowl, you can preemptively hype the game with tail gate parties and Super Bowl specific commercials. Not to mention hype knowing that you will know the winner after the game. 
What would it be like if the Stanley Cup was a one-and-out tournament with all the hype of the Super Bowl? 
In this essay, we will compare and contrast the most prestigious championships of four major American sports leagues – the Stanley Cup in the NHL, the Super Bowl in the NFL, the NBA Finals in the NBA, and the World Series in the MLB. The Stanley Cup is widely regarded as one of the most grueling championships in all of professional sports. 
Super Bowl 57 was historic for a number of reasons:  For the NHL, the Stanley Cup clocks in at 34.5 pounds, and is the tallest of the bunch at 35.25 inches tall. 
The players receive smaller replicas along with Super Bowl rings. Unlike the Stanley Cup, which is engraved and passed around annually, a new Lombardi Trophy is made each season. NFL - English; 
The Atlantic bottlenose dolphin has been making sports predictions since 2017 for various events, including the Stanley Cup, World Series, NBA Finals and NCAA National Championships, according to  
2) Kendrick vs Drake Props. The Super Bowl halftime show is the highlight of the event for most of America, and this year’s show promises extra spice. Kendrick Lamar will take the stage at Super Bowl 59, fresh off his 5 Grammy wins and ongoing feud with Canadian rapper Drake. 
He has covered dozens of marquee events including the 2010 Winter Olympics, the 2006 Stanley Cup final and Wrestlemania 23, and his work has appeared in more than 200 publications, including the  
The Stanley Cup has been given out since 1893. The Vince Lombardi Trophy (1967) is crafted each season by Tiffany &amp; Co. There's around 47 Lombardi trophy's and 1 Stanley Cup. Edit: As other people have mentioned, there is a replica version of the cup in the HHOF along with the original bowl. 
Stanley Cup is 1, I haven’t kept up with hockey in a long time but by nature it’s a very punishing sport both on the mind and body. You’re going to have to deal with fluke losses or 7 period overtime games consistently. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event of the year by a wide margin. People who haven’t watched a single NFL game all year will plan Super Bowl parties. That’s not to say that people consciously think ‘winning the Super Bowl is more impressive than winning the NBA Finals’. But way more people care about the former than the latter. 
ELI5: Why, exactly, has the Super Bowl become a much, much bigger cultural celebration in the USA than the World Series, NBA Finals, and Stanley Cup finals? Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. 
Here’s a glance at some other unique Super Bowl props: Luka vs. Chiefs.  NBA champion and NHL Stanley Cup champion. For example, the pick-four of the Eagles, Duke, Celtics and Capitals pays  
The 49ers also won the Super Bowl under Seifert's tutelage in 1995. 7. 1984-1990 Edmonton Oilers . Championships: 5; Stanley Cup Final appearances: 6; Wayne Gretzky was the man with the plan in  
After the Super Bowl fans really start to pay attention to the NHL season. This is the fun part of the season is always the drive to the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs. Get ready for super couple of months. </p>
