Since this incident, the NFL has now made it a requirement that all Super Bowl performances of the anthem are pre-recorded.

Before Super Bowl XXV in January of 1991, Whitney Houston sang the anthem in such an inspiring way that the single ended up going platinum (selling over a million copies) — except that the live performance wasn’t actually live. Houston was singing into a dead microphone and the NFL had, instead, used a pre-recorded version of her rendition

The technical and pressure-filled demands of the performance make the move understandable rather than scandalous. 
Asked why he recommended Whitney pre-record the anthem for the Super Bowl, Minor cited the unpredictability of live events, the noise of the crowd and the jet flyover and the echo and
