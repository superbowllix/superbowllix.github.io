        <p>And the best shows are the ones that transcend generations and demographics. Everyone loves Prince, old or young, white or black, it doesn’t matter. You can have great performances by any band, but there’s a lot of people that just don’t enjoy U2 and as such it’s not considered to be as good. 
At the end of that particular performance, Prince covers "Best of You" by Foo Fighters. This was a friendly "fuck you" to Foo for covering "Darling Nikki" without Princes' permission. In the most Prince-esque way, he found a way to retaliate by covering their own song on one of the "biggest" stages in the world. 
The memes flooding my feed facilitated so many trips to Chipotle at this point I’m convinced it was one of the greatest marketing schemes of all time. Adam not fully transforming into a Chipotle Bag has actually been surprising, I thought the Super Bowl was a career transition for him into the food industry! 
[+] February 07, 2021 in Tampa, Florida, one of the best Super Bowl halftime shows ever. Getty Images 14. Michael Jackson (1993) Super Bowl XXVII, Buffalo Bills vs. Dallas Cowboys. 
The best Super Bowl Halftime Shows of all time, from Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake to Prince. See how we ranked our top 14. 
With 117.5 million viewers, Gaga's set was one of the most-viewed Super Bowl halftime shows in history (third after Rihanna and Katy Perry, respectively) — and eclipsed the game's viewership. 
Rihanna — who is gracing us Sunday with her first public performance in nearly five years at Super Bowl LVII (Sunday 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX and the FOX Sports App) — is sure to upend it. 10. 
Usher is this year's Super Bowl 2024 halftime performer. Find out if he makes the list of the 10 best Super Bowl halftime shows of all time. 
What began with college marching bands showing their stripes, the Super Bowl halftime show soon became a full-blown music industry event. 1989's performer was 
Super Bowl XXXVI was a poignant one for a big reason—it was the first Super Bowl to take place in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. At the time of the show, it had only been a few months since that horrific day that had tragically and permanently impacted so many lives. 
#1- Super Bowl 51 Patriots-34 Falcons-28. I think this is the consensus opinion on the best Super Bowl out of this group and it has a good case for greatest Super Bowl ever but I think Ravens-49ers or Steelers-Cardinals are pretty hard to top. 
44 votes, 138 comments. true. Super Bowl 38 was a pretty insane game. Starts off as a defensive stalemate and then both offenses go off towards the end of the first half. 
Diana Ross was considered a safe choice for Super Bowl XXX, but only a diva of her magnitude could pull off such a shocking performance. It starts off with her descending from the sky on a sparking platform, slowing considerably through a medley of her biggest hits, like “Baby Love” and “Stop in the Name of Love” with tuxedo-clad dancers all around her. 
31 votes, 150 comments. 146K subscribers in the GenX community. Generation X was born, by broadest definition, between 1961 and 1981, the greatest 
Not a Chiefs fan, but I am ANIMATING my favorite play from every team! I was pretty shocked I didn't pick a Mahomes play also haha. This guy though was arguably one of the greatest at his craft, I don't think he is talked about enough to be honest with you. P.S. this my guess of Champ's least favs 
Panthers MLB Dan Morgan (#55) had 22 total tackles (16 Solo), 4 tackles for loss, 3 Pass Break Ups and 2 QB pressures. One of the greatest individual defensive performances in Super Bowl history. He set the NFL record for Total Tackles in a Super Bowl during this game, that record still stands today some 17+ years later. 
Her performance was great and rated one of the highest ever. She didn't give a typical pop girl performance was sparkles and lgbt flags like gaga, Katy and the like. It was very avant-garde and full of great visuals. There's a reason it has so many YouTube views 3 months after the performance. 
On a serious note, I don't have the time or inclination to go through all 52 Super Bowls + 104 Starting QB performances to check the averages with/without Brady and do a meaningful regression. On the other hand, Brady has 10 Super Bowl performances out of those 104, which means he's close to 10% of the overall population. 
Oh god, yes. When Bruno Freaking Mars is one of the 2 people that has to come to the rescue of your boring-ass super bowl show, you know you suck. And I think coldplay is a fine band, but not for the super bowl.
