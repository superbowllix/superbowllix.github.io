        <p>Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The most Super Bowl wins as a starting quarterback belong to Tom Terrific and his seven victories in the NFL title game (Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, LIII, and LV). He was the MVP of the biggest game five times. Conclusion. That is quite an impressive list of stars, but like they say, ” The Cream rises to the top.” 
The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three titles in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super Bowl titles. The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX , LI , and LIII for three titles in five seasons. 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
In his Super Bowl career, the six-time champion has the most starts (10) and wins (6) as a quarterback. He also holds the most career passing yards (2,838) and career passing touchdowns (18) in  
The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom Brady leads the pack with seven titles, three clear of any other quarterback, while  
33 players are tied for the most wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 1 win. The first three are Patrick Mahomes on February 11, 2024, on February 12, 2023 and on February 2, 2020, Matthew Stafford on February 13, 2022 and Tom Brady 7 times. 
Manning led the Broncos to the Super Bowl in 2014 and rode off into the sunset after winning Super Bowl 50 two years later. He holds many NFL records, including touchdown passes with 539 and MVP  
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles  
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
A fourth Super Bowl win would tie Mahomes with Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the second-most Super Bowl wins by a quarterback. Mahomes' 17 postseason wins are already the  
2. Joe Montana – 4 Super Bowl Wins. Joe Montana is another quarterback who is often mentioned in the conversation of the greatest of all time. With four Super Bowl wins to his name, Montana was known for his cool demeanor, accurate passing, and impeccable decision-making on the field. 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
The quarterbacks who won Super Bowls for the Pittsburgh Steelers are listed.

That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
In 2023, the Chiefs reached the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, securing Mahomes his second Lombardi Trophy. Currently positioned as the primary contender to Tom Brady’s seven titles, Mahomes has an opportunity to win his third Super Bowl on February 11, 2024, when the Chiefs take on San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII. </p>
