        <p>NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXII to San Diego on May 24, 1984, during their May 23–25, 1984 meetings in Washington, D.C.

Super Bowl XXII. By the 1987-88 season, teams were having trouble selling out stadiums, and viewership dropped 20%. Teams also played fewer regular-season games due to another players’ strike, taking to the field 15 times rather than the standard 16, with many starting players sitting out during negotiations. 
Doug Williams, Washington, Super Bowl XXII:  He had four touchdowns in the first half, and the game got so far out of reach that 49ers backup QB Bill Musgrave played the final series of the game. 
The 49ers defeated the Bengals 20–16, winning their third Super Bowl. The game was played on January 22, 1989, at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami (now part of the suburb of Miami Gardens, which became a separate city in 2003). This was the first Super Bowl hosted in the Miami area in 10 years, and the first in Miami not held at the Orange Bowl. 
This was the last Super Bowl played on the second to last Sunday in January. From 1990 to 2001, the game was played on the last Sunday of January, and from 2002 to 2021, on the first Sunday in February (with the exception of Super Bowl XXXVII, which was played on January 26, 2003).

Super Bowl Eighteen was different for Joe, as Tom Flores' Los Angeles Raiders blew-out Joe Theismann (2-ints), John Riggins (64-yds) and the rest of the Redskins, 38-9, in the Super Bowl's most lopsided contest yet. Marcus Allen literally ran away with Super Bowl MVP, compiling over 200 total yards and two touchdowns, with a record 192 rushing

Super Bowl 23. By the time the NFL penned Super Bowl XXIII into the schedule, the San Francisco 49ers were asserting themselves as a dynasty.
