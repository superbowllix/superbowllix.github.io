In his rookie season, Ahmed rushed for 319 yards and 3 touchdowns in just 6 games, providing a spark to the Dolphins' running game. With his career still in its infancy, Ahmed's future potential makes him an exciting addition to the long list of talented running backs who have graced the Miami Dolphins' roster. 
Among the most versatile running backs in the history of the Dolphins is Tony Nathan, who was selected by the team in the third round of the 1979 NFL Draft. After opening his career as a return man, Nathan worked his way into the offense and became a reliable runner and receiver while helping Miami to a pair of Super Bowl appearances. 
The Dolphins' first title game appearance came in Super Bowl VI on January 16, 1972, when Miami faced a daunting Dallas Cowboys crew at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
In 1972, Csonka helped Miami become the first team in the Super Bowl era to go undefeated. The following season, in 1973, he made his fourth straight Pro Bowl and won Super Bowl MVP, rushing for  
Jim Kiick (#21) rushes for Miami in Super Bowl VII. The 1972 Miami Dolphins season was the franchise's seventh season and third in the National Football League (NFL). The team was led by third-year head coach Don Shula and achieved the only perfect season in NFL history. It also led the league in both points scored and fewest points allowed.

The 1973 Miami Dolphins season was the franchise's eighth season and fourth season in the National Football League (NFL). The team entered the 1973 season as defending Super Bowl champion following its perfect undefeated 1972 season. In week 1, the Dolphins extended their winning streak to 18 with a 21–13 win over the San Francisco 49ers.

Eugene “Mercury” Morris - a three-time Pro Bowl running back, a two-time Super Bowl champion, a radiant and playful personality and perhaps the most vocal advocate for the undefeated Dolphins  
Joe Theismann is the only other former Notre Dame quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl, leading the Washington Redskins to a 27-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the 17th big game. 
Also helping that Eagles Super Bowl run was running back Jay Ajayi, who the Dolphins traded to the Eagles during the season for a fourth-round pick that ended up being used on another running back
