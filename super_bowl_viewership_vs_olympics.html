        <p>More than 2.5 million people watched the 2023 Super Bowl in Brazil, making it the country with the most viewers in South America. China was the country outside of the Americas with the largest  
On NBC alone, ratings increased 8% and viewership 30% from the comparable Sunday night in PyeongChang, with the obvious caveat that the 2018 telecast did not have a lead-in from the Super Bowl (9.1, 16.4M). Versus last year’s Super Bowl lead-out show, the series premiere of the CBS series “The Equalizer,” ratings fell 8% (from 10.7) but  
The most-watched telecasts of 2024 include the Super Bowl, Oscars and Olympics, while 'Tracker' and 'Young Sheldon' dominate among series.  VIEWERS (18-49) DATE AIRED: 1. Super Bowl LVIII  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
In fact, the NFL led viewership at the program level, with all top 10 U.S. sports programs comprising the 2023-2024 season NFL Super Bowl and playoff games. Super Bowl LVIII , featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, had the largest TV audience for a single-network telecast to date at 123.7 million viewers. 
The NFL and college football regularly filled most of the top 10 slots in total viewership, with the Super Bowl being the No. 1 telecast for a decade straight and the Olympics ranking high in the  
One would think a Super Bowl lead-in would get the Olympics to at least the 20 million mark, but in this Olympics one cannot even be completely sure viewership will surpass the comparable night in PyeongChang four years ago (18.2M across all NBC platforms). 
Interestingly, while Super Bowl viewership was higher in 2023 than 2022 Divisional and Wild Card Round viewership was down slightly in 2023 as compared to 2022. 
An average of 99.178 million viewers watched the Rams’ 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on NBC, the largest viewership for any U.S network since Super Bowl LIV. 
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of

FIFA World Cup 2006 vs. World Cup 2010; World Cup vs. Super Bowl vs. Olympics: The pinnacle of sports? Cricket One Day World Cup vs. Twenty20 World Cup; 1983 vs. 2011 Indian World Cup Cricket Team; Lionel Messi vs. Cristiano Ronaldo; Anaerobic vs. Aerobic Exercise; Salsa vs. Tango: What's the difference? 
Last year, the Super Bowl had an 82 rating in the city of Jacksonville. That means virtually everyone in the city watched the big game. By contrast, the Winter Olympics boasted an all-time high in national viewership last time with an audience of 190 million. How do these compare to the World Cup Juggernaut? 
World Cup vs Super Bowl Viewership. The 2021 Super Bowl between Tom Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs was the least-watched Super Bowl since 2008. Its 96.4  
I. f I was a betting person, way before the first play of the 2024 Super Bowl happened, I would bet the house on three things. Brands’ spokespeople will say that coughing up more than $7 million for a 30-second commercial, not including production costs (which can add many more millions of dollars to the ad), was money well spent. 
Is The Super Bowl Losing Popularity? The Super Bowl is undoubtedly the most watched broadcast in the US year after year. According to the NFL, the highest Super Bowl viewership in NFL history was Super Bowl LVII in 2023, with 115 million views. The last time the NFL saw numbers like that was Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 with 114 million viewers. 
The Super Bowl’s viewership is strong domestically, but when comparing its numbers to the worldwide reach of the World Cup or the Olympics, it falls behind. Therefore, while the Super Bowl is a  
The prior main event — Amanda Serrano vs. Katie Taylor 2 was billed as a “co-main event” — averaged an estimated 74 million live global viewers; 47 million were in the U.S., which is a new  
Also I never said the super bowl compares to the olympics. The NBC primetime broadcast of the Olympics averaged 31.1 million viewers. Super Bowl XLIXhad 114.4 million viewers. The World Series gets about 12-14 million viewers. The NBA finals brings in about 15 million viewers. Can we stop arguing now? </p>
