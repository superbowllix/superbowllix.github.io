        <p>Thus removing out-of-home viewing from the equation puts this year’s games at a disadvantage compared to those of the past. Super Bowl ratings and viewership, all-time. As of 2021, out-of-home viewing is now included in traditional Nielsen-reported audience. * NBC’s 2022 streaming audience was 11.2 million viewers across 6.0 million devices.

Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets  
The 21.8 million number refers to Out Of Home (OOH) viewers who watched the Super Bowl LVI in bars, restaurants, and other venues, including viewing in other people’s homes. To make it easy to get the numbers right, I have compiled a chart with viewership stats from 2013-2024 of all the numbers reported by the broadcast networks.

The World Cup winners’ haul looks handsome compared to the $164,000 each member of the Chiefs’ Super Bowl-winning team received from the NFL in 2024. San Francisco 49ers players took in around  
NFL Shop: Across NFL Shop sites in Europe, Canada and Mexico, total sales were up +39% year-on-year, compared to Super Bowl LVII. NFL Game Pass on DAZN: Viewership across Super Bowl LVIII week  
Female viewership in general was up 8% from last year from 53.78 million to 58.18 million, compared to a 5% increase among men. Women accounted for 47.5% of the overall audience, up from 46.7% last year. (Per the New York Post, that 47.5% mark is a new record for the Super Bowl.) 
That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
For Super Bowl LII in 2018, 103.4 million people worldwide saw the Philadelphia Eagles defeat the New England Patriots, 41-33 and the season prior, 111.3 viewers tuned in to Super Bowl LI. Compare those totals to the McGregor versus Mayweather fight, the biggest pay-per-view event of all time and in UFC history. 
Is The Super Bowl Losing Popularity? The Super Bowl is undoubtedly the most watched broadcast in the US year after year. According to the NFL, the highest Super Bowl viewership in NFL history was Super Bowl LVII in 2023, with 115 million views. The last time the NFL saw numbers like that was Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 with 114 million viewers. 
In fact, the NFL led viewership at the program level, with all top 10 U.S. sports programs comprising the 2023-2024 season NFL Super Bowl and playoff games. Super Bowl LVIII , featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, had the largest TV audience for a single-network telecast to date at 123.7 million viewers. 
How many viewers does the Super Bowl get? In comparison to the men’s FIFA World Cup final, not many at all. But from a United States-based audience perspective, it is the most-watched TV  
Not that I like one game over the other, but that comparison has its flaws too. Both are national leagues, but one is in a country with about 300 million people, and the other about 60 million. 
In the past three years, according to research by marketing professor Kim Whitler, the number of Super Bowl ads that have had male-only celebrities has declined by 26% compared with a similar  
As per Statista, the viewership of the Super Bowl LIV last year across the world was around 150 million. Even this year, the Super Bowl's viewership outside the United States is estimated to be in the region of 30-50 million, adding to the 96.4 million it recorded locally. How does the Super Bowl viewership compare to FIFA World Cup final?
