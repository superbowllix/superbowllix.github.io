"The Super Bowl Shuffle" is a song performed by the Chicago Bears football team (credited as the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew) in 1985. It was released in December 1985 on Chicago-based Red Label Records and distributed through Capitol Records [2] seven weeks ahead of their win in Super Bowl XX.

Under legendary NFL head coach Mike Ditka and defensive whiz Buddy Ryan, the Chicago Bears football team featured a record-setting defense and an offense led by quarterback Jim McMahon, running back Walter Payton and defensive lineman William Perry, better known as "Refrigerator Perry." 
In conclusion, The Super Bowl Shuffle remains an iconic piece of pop culture, with its memorable lyrics, entertaining dance moves, and controversial reception. It continues to be celebrated as a unique representation of the Chicago Bears’ journey to Super Bowl glory in 1985. Cultural Significance and Legacy
