        <p>The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
However, the 2019 game became the least-watched in more than a decade and the household rating for the Super Bowl declined for the fourth consecutive year.

Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched program in television history, with an average of 123.7 million viewers tuning in to the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win versus the 49ers. 
NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). 
That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
Sunday’s overtime thriller, which featured the Kansas City Chiefs facing off against the San Francisco 49ers, averaged 123.4 million viewers, CBS said Monday, breaking Super Bowl viewership records. 
The ratings growth continued in the postseason—the 12 playoff games leading up to Sunday's Super Bowl averaged 38.5 million viewers on TV and streaming platforms, the Associated Press reported

There's a new Super Bowl TV ratings record, as an average of 120.3 million viewers tuned in on CBS to watch the Chiefs beat the 49ers. 
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
Last year's Super Bowl, for example, brought in just shy of 115 million viewers-- a notable number because it was the highest since the 2014 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Seattle  
The Super Bowl LVII telecast ran from 6:44 PM ET to 10:14 PM ET and averaged nearly 112.2 million viewers on FOX. An additional 882,000 watched the Spanish broadcast on FOX Deportes. 
120.5 million viewers for Super Bowl 59 We will see an increase in viewership from the Super Bowl 57 matchup as it is the second time 2 Black Quarterbacks will face off in the big game and there is a great deal of interest in seeing whether or not the Chiefs can be the first team to three-peat! 
Nielsen also reported 202.4 million viewers had tuned in to some portion (a minimum of six minutes) of Super Bowl LVIII, a year-over-year increase of 10% (184 million).
