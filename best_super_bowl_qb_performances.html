        <p>Completions: 22 for 25, 268 yards, three touchdowns Quarterback rating: 150.9. Simms’ performance against the Broncos was the single-most efficient game in Super Bowl history. 
Joe Montana’s Super Bowl QB performance in 1990 is the best of all time because his stat sheet combined both of what made Young and Simms’ games so memorable. The Super Bowl XXIV MVP had an  
Following Mahomes' performance in Sunday night's 25-22 overtime win over the 49ers, we've decided to come up with a ranking of the top quarterback performances in Super Bowl history. This was the  
The best Super Bowl performance by a quarterback we have ever seen belongs to Rodgers in his one and only appearance — and it’s not even close. Rodgers had a 94.2 passing grade in his Super Bowl 45 victory over Pittsburgh and gathered up nine big-time throws while going without a single turnover-worthy play. 
That game did not earn a spot among the top 25 performances from a quarterback in the Super Bowl, but Brady did top this list with four appearances. Three quarterbacks—Brady, Montana and Kurt  
Tom Brady and Joe Montana stand out as the best quarterbacks in Super Bowl history. By Logan Reardon • Published January 31, 2025 • Updated on February 2, 2025 at 8:04 am NBC Universal, Inc.

What is the record for completions in a Super Bowl? Tom Brady and Peyton Manning dominate this list. They have five of the top 10 performances in terms of completions, though there is a key difference between the two – Brady’s three appearances on the list all came in wins against the Atlanta Falcons (No. 1), Seattle Seahawks (No. 2) and Carolina Panthers (tied for No. 4), while Manning  
5. Phil Simms, Giants vs. Broncos, Super Bowl 21. The year was 1987, and the New York Giants beat the Denver Broncos 39-20 in Super Bowl 21. Within that, Simms recorded one of the most efficient quarterback performances in Super Bowl history, going 22-of-25 for 268 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions. 
49ers QB Steve Young had six passing touchdowns in a 49-26 rout over the Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX. He had four touchdowns in the first half, and the game got so out of reach that 49ers backup QB Bill Musgrave played the final series of the game. 
Of the top 20 passer rating performances in Super Bowl history, 17 of them came from winning quarterbacks, including Rodgers’ outstanding game in Super Bowl XLV. It was only Rodgers’ third year as the starting quarterback, and he outdueled two-time Super Bowl champion Ben Roethlisberger to take home the title. 
9. Marcus Allen, RB, Los Angeles Raiders (Super BOWL XVIII) On top of an all-time performance, Marcus Allen also has one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history. After being caught dead to rights on a blown-up rushing play in Super Bowl XVIII, Allen reversed direction before finding a crease for a 74-yard touchdown. 
Joe Montana’s Super Bowl QB performance in 1990 is the best of all time because his stat sheet combined both of what made Young and Simms’ games so memorable. The Super Bowl XXIV MVP had an
