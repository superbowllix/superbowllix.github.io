        <p>The Minnesota Vikings started playing in the NFL in 1961 before the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Since their creation, the Vikings as of 2022 have won at least three games in every regular season, excluding 1962, and are just one of seven teams to have been victorious in at least 15 regular season games. 
The Minnesota Vikings have a 0-4 (0%) record in the Super Bowl. When was the last time the Minnesota Vikings lost the Super Bowl? The Minnesota Vikings last lost the Super Bowl in the 1976 season. 
All of those teams have at least made the Super Bowl and more than half have won it.  Minnesota Vikings 7; 1975 Super Bowl (9): Pittsburgh Steelers 16, Minnesota Vikings 6; 
The Minnesota Vikings have appeared in the Super Bowl 4 times, in 1969, 1973, 1974 and 1976. How many Super Bowls have the Vikings won? The Minnesota Vikings have never won a Super Bowl. 
The Minnesota Vikings have never won the Super Bowl. The Vikings have reached the Super Bowl a total of four times (1970, 1974, 1975, and 1977) but have never won. They are one of two teams in NFL history that have reached the Super Bowl four times without a win. 
More than a third of the teams in the NFL have never won a Super Bowl, and four franchises have never even appeared the title game.  Most Super Bowl appearances without a win: Vikings: 4. Bills  
Although the Vikings have failed to win any Super Bowl games, they have appeared in four games as of December 2024. Their first appearance was in the Super Bowl IV in 1970. 
How Many Super Bowls Have the Vikings Won? Despite reaching a quartet of Super Bowls, the Vikings have never hoisted the Lombardi Trophy. In fact, the team has never really been all that close, as its narrowest defeat came by a score of 10 points when Minnesota fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers 6-16 on January 12, 1975, in Super Bowl IX.

The Vikings have made four trips to the Super Bowl in their 57 years as a team.. Minnesota's first appearance in the Super Bowl was Super Bowl IV in 1970 when the Chiefs toppled the Vikings 23-7. 
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game.

No Super Bowl Wins. Despite his dominance, Moss never found himself hoisting a Lombardi Trophy. The teams he played for made it to two Super Bowls, including the 16-0 Patriots, who lost to the New York Giants, and the 49ers, who lost to the Baltimore Ravens.
