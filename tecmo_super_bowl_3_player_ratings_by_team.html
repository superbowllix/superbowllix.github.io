        <p>Comprehensive list of player attributes, rankings, and teams for TSB III Google Docs Form The Book of Armaments - 2017 Update.xls  Tecmo Super Bowl III ; TSB III  
I've been tinkering with 100-point-scale TSB III ratings for a few years, and every system I've ever done actually shows Dallas as the best team ratings-wise, with San Francisco 2nd. Miami, in my system, comes out 3rd, with Denver 4th, and Pittsburgh 5th. 
Let's take a closer look at how this scoring system works for two players: Jerry Rice and Bo Jackson. First, here are the attributes and scores for each player. (Reminder: Score = Highest value for any player at that position/player value * 100) Rice: Running Speed: 44 (69.84%) Maximum Speed: 69 (92.00%) Hitting Power: 13 (0%) Ball Control: 81  
Among the Tecmo Super Bowl community, it is common for distinguished groups/tournament organizers (such as the Tomczak Bowl) to create tier lists, rankings of a teams's potential in tournaments. Tomczak Bowl uses a tier system of play. Teams are grouped into tiers of five based on their overall strength of play. Tier 1 is reserved for the best teams while Tier 5 is for the not so great. All 28

Hi! Huge TSB3 fan. At one point (circa 1996) I unlocked the historic players after winning 3 consecutive Super Bowls with the same team. I made a spreadsheet with each players' abilities mapped out. 
1. San Francisco 49ers: Unsurprisingly, the team that has Joe Montana and Jerry Rice on it is pretty good. But it takes more than two great players to make a great team, and the 49ers great players all over, on both sides off the ball. While the running backs aren't all that great by themselves, 
For Tecmo Super Bowl III: Final Edition on the Super Nintendo, a GameFAQs message board topic titled "Team lineups/player stats FAQ". 
For Tecmo Super Bowl on the Super Nintendo, Roster FAQ by Toad22484.  rosters I've always wanted a quick reference guide to all the tecmo teams players and Ratings  
Yeah I did, too, at first. But really look at their defense. Fulcher is a superstar and I gave him 125 points, higher than any other player in the game except Jerry Rice, and Francis is slightly above average (a lot of guys have at least 31 RS and 44 RP), but other than that it sucks. 
No, I did the three-year. It started in 1992, then when the 1993 season started, I looked for the 1992 stats, but they didn't show up.I'm trying to sim through a whole season using 'trade' mode and see what happens at the end of the year. 
Tecmo Super Bowl 3 – Training Manual Understanding your Roster – This might be the most important aspect of learning the game. Each team has 37 players (17 offensive, 18 defensive, 2 special teams). Each player has a series of attributes that determine how good that player is. 
MIA – Marino is a unique QB in Tecmo due to his excellent passing speed and good control, which can take man defenders out of their usual coverage game. And MIA has an above average core of pass catchers with Clayton/Duper/Jensen. 
After being involved in countless 2-player games against 3 buddies, here's where I feel the teams stack up. 1. New York Giants. Other teams have more star players. Other teams have a better playbook. Other teams don't have LT and the best punter in the game. Giants really aren't the "best" team, but they are the hardest to beat. 
The reason is that not all the Tecmo ratings are on the same scale. For example, with WRs you have a few players with 81rec but there are quite a lot with 75rec. With RBs you have one at 75ms, one at 69ms, and 4 at 63ms.

A few things:-I'm totally new here, so forgive me if this topic has come up before-This is assuming head-to-head play against another human. I am not considering at all how well each team is to have against the computer.-I never change playbooks nor do I allow my opponent to, so the playbooks are </p>
