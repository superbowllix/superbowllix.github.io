        <p>The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
The Eagles and Chiefs' 2023 Super Bowl clash - which the latter won - drew incredible viewing figures. A whopping 115.1 million viewers tuned in to watch the Chiefs' 38–35 triumph at Super Bowl 57. The record was eclipsed the following year, with 123.7 million viewers tuning in to watch the Chiefs' overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers. 
That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
There's a new Super Bowl TV ratings record, as an average of 120.3 million viewers tuned in on CBS to watch the Chiefs beat the 49ers. 
The Super Bowl on Sunday drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers who watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in a nail-biting overtime triumph, CBS Sports said in a

Sunday’s overtime thriller, which featured the Kansas City Chiefs facing off against the San Francisco 49ers, averaged 123.4 million viewers, CBS said Monday, breaking Super Bowl viewership records. 
Super Bowl ratings hit the 40 mark for the first time in three years. Sunday’s Super Bowl 57 (Chiefs-Eagles) averaged a 40.0 rating and 113.06 million viewers across FOX (112.7M) and Fox Deportes (882K), marking the highest rated Super Bowl in three years (Chiefs-49ers: 41.6) and the most-watched in six (Patriots-Falcons: 113.7).* 
A rematch of the most-watched Super Bowl on record — at least officially — delivered one of the top audiences of the NFL season. Sunday’s Chiefs-49ers NFL national window averaged a 12.9 rating and 27.08 million viewers on FOX, marking the third-largest Nielsen-measured audience of the NFL season. 
It was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show since Katy Perry’s performance in 2015. It also was the second most-watched Super Bowl halftime performance on record. In terms of metered markets, Kansas City led the way with 52 rating and an 87 share. That essentially means that 87% of households in K.C. were tuning into the Chiefs game. 
With the Kansas City Chiefs going for an unprecedented threepeat and the Eagles hoping for a second Super Bowl win plus having Kendrick Larmar at halftime coming off a Grammy win, there is going to be a lot of interest in Super Bowl LIX. Yes, there will be Chiefs fatigue, but with a lot of viewers hoping to see the Eagles stop the three-peat, I  
Super Bowl 59 will take place on Sunday, February 9 at 6:30 p.m. ET at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. This year, the Kansas City Chiefs will represent the AFC, while the Philadelphia Eagles  
That's exactly what happened. In the first Super Bowl matchup between the Chiefs and Philadelphia  Hurts had 141 yards targeting his top two wideouts while registering a 143.4 passer rating. 
A champion will be crowned when the Philadelphia Eagles battle the Kansas City Chiefs (-1.5, 48.5) in Super Bowl 59. The action kicks off from Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday, February  
The Kansas City Chiefs seek a historic third consecutive Super Bowl title against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans. This clash is a rematch of their 2023 encounter. Key storylines include a potential dynasty for the Chiefs, Saquon Barkley's impact for the Eagles, and officiating controversies.
