The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
The Super Bowl isn’t going to become the most-watched sporting event on Earth, and the FIFA World Cup — nor anything else — is likely going to oust the NFL title game from its domestic throne. 
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games.

Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four
