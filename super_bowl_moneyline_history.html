The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
The most infamous finale in Super Bowl history for oddsmakers was Super Bowl XIII and a lesson learned for all individuals standing behind the betting counter. The 13th installment saw the Steelers open as 4.5-point favorites over the Cowboys and the number dropped to 3.5 -points with early action on the Cowboys.
