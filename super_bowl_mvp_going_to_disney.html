        <p>Super Bowl LIV MVP Patrick Mahomes in the parade at the Magic Kingdom the day after the game "I'm going to Disney World!" and "I'm going to Disneyland!" are advertising slogans used in a series of television commercials by The Walt Disney Company that began airing in 1987. [1] 
The first Super Bowl MVP to utter the now-iconic phrase was New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms, whose team defeated the Denver Broncos 39-20 in Super Bowl XXI in 1987. 
Since Simms became the first Super Bowl MVP to go to Disney in 1987, at least one player has uttered the line in all but one year (2005), when there was no commercial following Super Bowl XXXIX  
The Super Bowl Disney World trip is a decades-long NFL tradition. Since 1987, Super Bowl MVPs have been treated to a trip to "The Happiest Place on Earth. 
After his 2019 Super Bowl win, his last with the New England Patriots, Brady and game MVP Julian Edelman appeared in the Walt Disney World parade the day after the game. 
The beloved tradition dates back to Super Bowl XXI in 1987, according to Disney Parks Blog.As ESPN also reports, New York Giants quarterback and MVP Phil Simms was the first to shout the now  
One of the Super Bowl's most famous and long-established traditions has nothing do with football, let alone the NFL. Every year, the Super Bowl MVP proclaims "I'm going to Disney World!" to an  
Sometimes the Super Bowl’s standout performer offers a slight variation on the theme, saying they’re going to Walt Disney World. It comes across as an off-the-cuff moment in the celebratory hubbub after the NFL’s showpiece game has culminated, with confetti still falling and the hordes of players staff and media still flooding the field. 
Since Simms became the first Super Bowl MVP to go to Disney in 1987, at least one player has uttered the line in all but one year (2005), when there was no commercial following Super Bowl XXXIX. It was a brief hiatus for the campaign, which has continued every year in the nearly two decades since. 
Monday's visit will mark the third time the Chief's 28-year-old quarterback has visited a Disney theme park as the Super Bowl MVP. Mahomes appeared at Walt Disney World Resort in 2020 after Kansas

Each year after the Super Bowl game, it has been a tradition for a player of the winning team (usually the MVP) to say that they going to Disneyland or Disney World, which is followed by their appearance soon after (often the next day) as part of a celebratory cavalcade. 
Disney's marketing department began working on the campaign and coordinated efforts to work with the Super Bowl XXI MVP. In 1987, that was Phil Simms of the New York Giants. 
This year, Super Bowl LIX will be held in New Orleans, and the winning MVP player will be headed to visit Disney World the day afterward. In this year's game, the Kansas City Chiefs face off with the Philidelphia Eagles. We will share everything you need to know about the 2025 Super Bowl parade at Disney World! 
In 1987, Phil Simms, a former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, was featured in the first Disney post-Super Bowl ad exclaiming that he planned to go to Disneyland following his team

I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information from the Disney playbook. I just spoke to an MVP of a Cast Member who confirmed that, at the time of this writing, no official announcement has been made about the Super Bowl parade. However, this Cast Member also told me that a Super Bowl parade generally occurs the day after the big  
The "I'm going to Disney!" tradition didn't start until Super Bowl 21 in 1987. Twice in history there was no Disney theme park celebration in Orlando or Anaheim for the winning Super Bowl team. 
The following year, Mahomes and the Chiefs were back in Super Bowl LV, but the hometown Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated them at Raymond James Stadium. Following that victory, Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady and longtime teammate Rob Gronkowski turned to the TV cameras and said that iconic line: “I’m going to Disney World!” But they didn’t. </p>
