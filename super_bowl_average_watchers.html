        <p>In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until

An additional 2.3 million viewers watched the Spanish-language broadcast on Univision, and 1.2 million tuned in to watch the kid-friendly broadcast on Nickelodeon and Nick-at-Nite. The overtime thriller between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs drew a combined average household rating of 43.5, and combined household share of 83.

That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
NEW YORK – February 14, 2023 –An estimated 113.06 million viewers were tuned in for Super Bowl LVII on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The Super Bowl LVII telecast ran from 6:44 PM ET to 10:14 PM ET and averaged nearly 112.2 million viewers on FOX. 
How much do Super Bowl 59 tickets cost? This year's Super Bowl tickets are at lower prices compared to the same point as last year, according to TickPick. The average ticket price is $6,645, per

Across the 18 categories in Table 9, the average index (214.6) is more than twice that for Super Bowl watchers—those making no purchases index lower at 95.6. More frequently purchased products, such as groceries and pet supplies, are indexed somewhat lower than less frequently purchased products, such as appliances and sporting goods. 
The Super Bowl typically starts around 6:30pm ET, and lasts (on average) 3.5 hours. Over the last 20 years, only four Super Bowls have finished in under 3.5 hours. 
Football’s average age of its viewers was at 50. That’s better. It’s still not the NBA (42) or soccer (39). A 1.5-year median age jump in one year for the Super Bowl should be a slight concern. After all, just staying at the same rate should make the average median age 48.7. No league wants to be associated with an aging fanbase.
