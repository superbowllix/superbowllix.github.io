        <h2><strong>super bowl qb smoking super bowl when the power went out</strong></h2>
        <p>A quarterback smoking at halftime of the Super Bowl? Unheard of these days.  Will Len Dawson’s Super Bowl smoking photo get a reboot? Smoking in NFL locker rooms may be a remnant of the past,  
The photo Pro Football Hall of Fame QB Len Dawson – who died at 87 – smoking a cigarette during halftime of the first Super Bowl is still remembered. 
Explore the iconic moment from Super Bowl I where Len Dawson, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, redefined cool under pressure with a cigarette and a Fresca during halftime. Dive into the backstory of this legendary photo, its reflection on the era's social norms, and its enduring legacy in sports cult 
Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes came to the stadium tonight in a sweatshirt with the famous TIME Magazine picture of Chiefs QB Len Dawson at halftime of Super Bowl I, smoking a cigarette and drinking a  
The two quarterbacks went back-and-forth with touchdowns, with the difference being a 14-yard run by Packers running back Jim Taylor, which the Chiefs could only answer with a field goal. 
He spent 14 years with the organization as he racked up seven Pro Bowl nominations, including four in a row between 1966 and 1969. He finished his career with 28,711 passing yards, 239 touchdowns  
Photos are much like time machines, they can really give us a glimpse into how things used to be. That’s the case of one picture of former Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson. In the now iconic photo you can see Dawson Sitting on a chair at halftime of Super Bowl I, Dawson was taking a drag from his cigarette when the photo was shot. 
This is Chiefs QB and HOFer Len Dawson smoking a cigarette and drinking a Fresca at halftime of SB I.  They went on to win Super Bowl IV under Stram, and Dawson was named that game’s MVP. He  
A quarterback smoking at halftime of the Super Bowl? Unheard of these days. But it happened at the very first edition, and here's what led to the moment being photographed. 
With the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl for the first time since Hall of Fame quarterback Len Dawson led them to a famous win in 1970, now is the perfect time to remind everyone that for all the pomp and circumstance around the modern NFL, it's a 6-0, 190-pound quarterback from the 60s who is featured in arguably the most amazing single photograph in pro football history. 
Both quarterbacks have also experienced roughly a tale of two seasons, enduring a turnover-littered stretch to open the season -- with Hurts forcing passes in key spots, including the red zone  
And man, do you need a cigarette after while playing in a hard-fought Super Bowl I contest in which the Packers dominated those AFL underdogs 35-10. Well, Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson can feel  
Bradshaw threw for 300-plus yards in half his Super Bowls which, in the 1970s, was the quarterback equivalent of going to the moon (Super Bowl XII, in 1978, featured 217 total net passing yards). 
NEW ORLEANS — On Wednesdays and Thursdays, Patrick Mahomes enters the Kansas City Chiefs quarterbacks room around 6:30 a.m. He pulls his headphones over his ears, his hoodie over the headphones. 
Another less iconic photo of Len Dawson smoking a cigarette (Bill Ray/Life Picture Collection/Getty Images). Honorable Mentions. Ken Stabler and Jack Lambert were also frequent smokers at games. These greats literally sacrificed their minds, bodies, and teeth for the game. They can smoke all they want, wherever they want. 
Though the goal for any team is to win the Super Bowl and hoist the Lombardi Trophy, the Seattle Seahawks were playing for individual hardware too in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers  
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
And then at age 26 in year 5, he was comfortable in his second Super Bowl. Idk how the stats reflect that progression, especially with how the OL was almost a polar opposite in 2008 from how it was in 2005, but that’s what I remember watching.

Carson Wentz once again will mostly be a spectator on the sidelines during a Super Bowl appearance by the Philadelphia Eagles. Seven years after he watched his backup Nick Foles win the MVP after delivering the Eagles their first Super Bowl title, Wentz is back on the big stage as a backup to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes as the Chiefs prepare to take on his former team and his former backup  </p>
