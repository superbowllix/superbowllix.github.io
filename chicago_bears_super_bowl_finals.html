The Bears made it to a Super Bowl last in 2006, after which they came closest to a Super Bowl appearance in 2010 (lost the Conference Championship to their rivals Green Bay Packers). Bears play in  
The Chicago Bears last played a home playoff game on Jan 6, 2019  have appeared in the Super Bowl 2 times, in 1985 and 2006.  
Super Bowl XLI was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Indianapolis Colts and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2006 season.

The Chicago Bears have a playoff record of 17 wins and 20 losses in 37 games as of December 2024. Get Chicago Bears complete playoff history, appearances, wins and super bowl information. All you  
Super Bowl XLI, played on Feb. 4, 2007, pitted the Bears against the Indianapolis Colts.

The next season, Chicago had the franchise's best season to date, going 15-1 in the regular season and marching all the way to Super Bowl XX, where they

III: The Bears taped "The Super Bowl Shuffle" at the Park West in Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 3, hours after landing in Chicago following their only loss of the season, a 38-24 defeat on Monday Night Football in Miami. Walter Payton and Jim McMahon taped their portions later via a green screen in a racquetball court at Halas Hall. 
The Bears won Super Bowl XX, the first one they appeared in. That season was famous for the release of the "Super Bowl Shuffle," a quintessentially '80s rap song that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 immediately following Chicago's championship and is still talked about today. 
McCaskey had served as the team’s owner since 1983 when her father George Halas passed away, and under her watch the Bears made 14 playoff appearances, including winning the Super Bowl in 1986  
Take heart, Bears fans. Your team is in a 21-year cycle of recurring excellence — 1985, 2006, etc. Should it persist, you’ll be headed for New Orleans and Super Bowl LXII after the 2027 season. 
Virginia Halas McCaskey, the matriarch of the Bears franchise and the NFL’s most direct link to its very founding, died Thursday at the age of 102. One of founder George Halas’ two children

The first guest I wanted to feature was a no-brainer. Tom Thayer is the only person on earth who grew up in the Chicago area as a Bears fan, helped his hometown team win a Super Bowl and has remained with the team for decades as a radio analyst. In the Bears universe, the Joliet native is the most interesting man in the world. 
No, the Chicago Bears were the mightiest, proudest, most ferocious team in NFL history. Chicago won its first 12 games in a row, and most of them by convincing margins: 45-10 over the Redskins, 26-10 over the 49ers, 44-0 over the Cowboys, even 20-7 over the Patriots early in the season. </p>
