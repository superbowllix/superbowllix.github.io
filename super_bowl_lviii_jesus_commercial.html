As far as the He Gets Us commercial that aired during Super Bowl LVIII, BrandHaven president Jason Vanderground spoke to Crain's Grand Rapid Business about how he saw the ad as being essential at

Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched Super Bowl in history, and while the Dallas Cowboys may not have reached the big game, their home region still managed to find its way into the night's  
This year the ad campaign got an early start playing its black and white commercials during the NFL playoffs, which generated more than 166 million impressions, Deseret News reports. "We've had three ads that have been running on a lot of the big sports networks leading up to the Super Bowl," said Jordan Carson, spokesperson for "He Gets Us." 
A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines. 
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Who Is My Neighbor,” the 15-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.”

Wahlberg, 52, teamed with Jesus Christ — aka actor Jonathan Roumie from TBN’s “The Chosen” — to encourage prayer in a 30-second Super Bowl LVIII commercial for the Catholic app Hallow. 
Super Bowl LVIII is bringing out all the commercials and movie trailers. During the championship game, viewers were met with a commercial from an organization that they may have remembered from  
The Jesus advertisement was funded by David for the second year in a row, helping to run a pair of Super Bowl ads in commercial time worth millions of dollars meant to promote "loving your neighbor like Jesus did". The original 'He Gets Us' Super Bowl ad spots, which ran in 2023, encouraged viewers to 'love your enemies'.
