        <p>New Orleans will host its 11th Super Bowl this year, tying Miami for the most ever. Los Angeles is in third with eight games. The city is a natural setting for several reasons. 
New Orleans moves into a tie with South Florida as the site where the most Super Bowl games have been played. See the full list with game results. 
The city hosted the Super Bowl four times in the 1970s, twice in the 1980s and twice in the 1990s. New Orleans also hosted the Super Bowl in 2002, which culminated with a 20-17 upset victory by  
New Orleans hosted its first Super Bowl on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in front of a crowd of nearly 81,000. Led by Head Coach Hank Stram, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in the last-ever championship between the NFL and AFL before the two leagues merged. 
In fact, with the addition of Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, the Super Bowl has been played in New Orleans 11 times. New Orleans is tied with Miami for the most hosted Super Bowls; however, the Caesars Superdome has hosted eight Super Bowls, the most of any venue to date.

The city of New Orleans has hosted the Super Bowl 11 times, the most of any city and second-most of any metropolitan area (Miami). Caesars Superdome — previously the Louisiana Superdome and Mercedes-Benz Superdome — has hosted the game seven times, the most of any stadium. Tulane Stadium — demolished in 1980 — hosted three times. 
Super Bowl LIX will take place next month in the Superdome. The venue has hosted many NFL championships, as New Orleans has been a great backdrop. Which games have taken place in New Orleans and what other venue hosted the Super Bowl? Let’s take a look  
New Orleans will host its 11th Super Bowl this year, tying Miami for the most ever. Los Angeles is in third with eight games. The city is a natural setting for several reasons. 
The City of New Orleans says it has spent more than 18 months preparing to host its 11th Super Bowl on Feb. 9 NEW ORLEANS -- After a New Year's Day attack struck at the heart of the French Quarter  
That's the New Orleans way. Look at all the artist you've of you from New Orleans. No, no. They're all unique in what they bring and that's. I'm talking about you. I'm talking about you.
