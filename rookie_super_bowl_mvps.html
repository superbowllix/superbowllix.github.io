Following victory in the Ice Bowl, led the Packers to victory in the first-ever Super Bowl against the American Football League’s Kansas City Chiefs.

Players with the most to gain/lose at the Super Bowl Jalen Hurts. Hurts is not the headliner here, but I’m listing him first because he stands to gain the most in the Super Bowl.
