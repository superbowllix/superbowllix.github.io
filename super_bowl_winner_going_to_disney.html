As the confetti is still falling at the Super Bowl, you can expect these four magical words: “I’m going to Disney!” The now-iconic phrase has been exclaimed by Hall of Famers and football greats, 
Typically, Super Bowl winners go to Disney World the day after the Super Bowl. On that day, the chosen player usually participates in a Disney World or Disneyland parade. 
If you've ever wondered how this came to be, the iconic commercial got its start after the 1987 Super Bowl when winning quarterback Phil Simms was the first to take in a payday (reportedly $75,000 in 1987) in exchange for saying a couple of lines and taking a trip to Disney World. 
Sometimes the Super Bowl’s standout performer offers a slight variation on the theme, saying they’re going to Walt Disney World.

Shortly after the dinner party was held, Phil Simms led the New York Giants to a 39-20 win over the Denver Broncos. Following the victory, Disney paid Simms $50,000 to say, “I’m going to Disney 
The day after the Super Bowl, the chosen player usually takes part in a parade at either Disneyland or Disney World. One notable exception was in 2021, when Tampa Bay Buccaneers stars Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski had to forgo the parade, which was canceled due to COVID-19. 
“I’m going to Disney World” is a phrase you’ve probably heard many times after a team wins the Super Bowl. It is one of the great traditions that is related to the amusement park found 
Following Super Bowl XXV in 1991, OJ Anderson the games MVP was given the option to say the traditional I'm going to Walt Disney World or to dedicate the win for the troops due to the Gulf War. Anderson chose the latter. 
In 1987, Phil Simms, a former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, was featured in the first Disney post-Super Bowl ad exclaiming that he planned to go to Disneyland following his team  
Since 1987, the entertainment giant has regularly tapped top performers from the winning Super Bowl team to declare “I’m going to Disney World!” after the win. Recent participants in the  
I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information from the Disney playbook. I just spoke to an MVP of a Cast Member who confirmed that, at the time of this writing, no official announcement has been made about the Super Bowl parade. However, this Cast Member also told me that a Super Bowl parade generally occurs the day after the big

Walt Disney World has announced that they will host the Super Bowl Super Bowl LIX this year with the event being held in New Orleans. The parade will be on Monday, February 10th and it traditionally features the MVP of the Super Bowl.

“I’m going to Disney World!” and “I’m going to Disneyland!” have solidified their spots in the cultural consciousness thanks to the Super Bowl. These phrases, often exclaimed post-game with different commercials airing based on regional locations, have been commonly uttered by non-Super Bowl champions since their debut in 1987.
