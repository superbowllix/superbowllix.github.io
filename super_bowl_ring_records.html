This is a list of Super Bowl records. The list of records is separated by individual players and teams. Players and teams, along with their records, are noted with the Super Bowl game played. All records can be referenced at the National Football League (NFL)'s official website, NFL.com. [1]

Super Bowl rings’ history dates back to the first Super Bowl occurrence, Super Bowl I, where inaugural winners, Green Bay Packers, were awarded the single one-carat diamond ring. However, the tradition of championship rings traces to baseball in 1922, when the New York Giants won the 1922 World Series. 
The auction record for a ring once owned by a player ring belongs to the 2012 sale of Lawrence Taylor’s Super Bowl XXV ring, which he had won with the New York Giants. It sold for $230,401.
