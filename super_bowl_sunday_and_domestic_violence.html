        <p>The weeks and months after the 1993 Super Bowl saw a fair amount of backpedaling by those who had propagated the Super Bowl Sunday violence myth, but as usual the retractions and corrections  
The Post’s 1993 article particularly pushed back against the claim being made by anti-violence advocates at the time that the Super Bowl is the single highest peak of domestic violence cases in  
A study shows that police receive increased calls reporting domestic violence every Sunday during football season [iii]. Researchers analyzed over 700 cities and counties using data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) of police reports, revealing that these spikes are linked to teams losing a game [iii]. 
"The Super Bowl does not cause domestic violence, and it doesn't increase domestic violence, but it does increase the public's awareness of the issue, which will help victims learn about help and  
In the 1990s, reporters began circulating a chilling statistic: Super Bowl Sunday was the most dangerous day of the year for women in abusive relationships. 
The fantastic fact-checking website Snopes tackled the football and domestic violence connection back in 2001. That article pointed to a 1993 news conference by a coalition of women’s groups, bringing forth “significant anecdotal evidence suggest[ing] that Super Bowl Sunday is ‘the biggest day of the year for violence against women.’” 
A 2021 study found that since 2000, 134 NFL players have been arrested for domestic violence, making it the most common criminal charge among players. As Americans tune in to the Super Bowl on Sunday, it’s important to acknowledge this event isn’t just about football. 
Clarifying myths and facts about domestic violence By RACHEL POMERANCE January 31, 2013 Urban myths rarely have a useful purpose other than to confound, outrage, and frighten people into passing them along. But there’s a silver lining to this one—the idea that Super Bowl Sunday is linked to 
COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — With flowing beer taps, tensions running high and large gatherings, it’s often said that rates of domestic violence and human trafficking spike during the Super Bowl. 
“We know from statistics that domestic violence cases seem to rise during game days. And this is the Super Bowl, so it’s very significant to talk about this very serious issue during the Super Bowl weekend,” Howard Smith said. While the Super Bowl is over, Howard Smith said the fight against domestic violence is ongoing. 
The researchers found a tiny positive effect for a rise in domestic violence dispatches on or after Super Bowl Sunday. By comparison, they found a much bigger effect for a rise in domestic violence calls around major holidays like Christmas though — nearly fives times as many.

Domestic Violence and Super Bowl Sunday: The Original Myth The fantastic fact-checking website Snopes tackled the football and domestic violence connection back in 2001 . That article pointed to a 1993 news conference by a coalition of women’s groups, bringing forth “significant anecdotal evidence suggest[ing] that Super Bowl Sunday is  
“A 2006 study published in the Handbook of Sports and Media that examined over 1.3 million domestic violence police reports from every day of the yearfound only a very small rise in domestic violence dispatches on (or just after) Super Bowl Sunday but nearly a quintupling of domestic violence police dispatch reports around major holidays  
This Sunday, America will celebrate our non-official national holiday – The Super Bowl.As a divorce lawyer, I sometimes get asked, “Is it true that there are more domestic violence incidents on Super Bowl Sunday than any other day?” 
“The claim that Super Bowl Sunday is the largest day for domestic violence is one that is not well supported by statistics,” president and co-founder of Arizona State's Team One Love organization and ASU biochemistry sophomore Julie Alvarez said. “This may have stemmed from the idea that testosterone-filled heterosexual men on game day  
Domestic violence is a serious problem, but the fuss about Super Bowl Sunday makes it more likely that allegations will be encouraged, whether or not they are strictly true. Emotions Do Run High In the past, the idea that domestic violence increased on Super Bowl Sunday was attributed to the fact that people sit around a television all day  
While there is a spike in domestic abuse calls on Super Bowl Sunday, experts and advocates agree the event does not produce a peak in the number of incidents. An uptick occurs on most major holidays. 
The perpetuation of the Super Bowl myth has potentially harmful consequences. By making the domestic violence about the date on the calendar rather than the reprehensible act itself, the game becomes yet one more excuse in the arsenal of apologies for domestic violence. </p>
