        <p>Super Bowl Overtime Rules I noticed the ref explaining that each team would get a possession in OT. There was a lot of controversy around the 49ers’ decision to go first. 
That gives a massive advantage to the the team that wins the coin toss in overtime because it could just march down the field and win the game without the other team's offense ever getting a shot. It just boggles my mind that a game could come down to the consequences of a single coin toss. Remember Super Bowl 51? 
regular season- if clock expired and the 49ers were up by 3 in overtime, game over? If tied, then ends in a tie. No second overtimes. Correct. playoffs/ Super Bowl- each team must now get a possession. The time doesn’t matter? They'll change direction. That could matter a bit in an outdoor game with wind, but otherwise no. 
The Patriots won the first overtime Super Bowl after making a 28-3 second-half comeback against the Falcons. New England's win came amid the old overtime rules, when the game automatically ended  
Only two Super Bowl have ever gone to overtime. You might remember both. Somehow, the Patriots forced an extra period despite trailing the Falcons 28-3. And of course Tom Brady and New England won  
Last season’s Super Bowl gave fans their first look at the new playoff overtime rules in action. Months of debate over how teams might handle the situation were finally tested. And many were  
It ensures both teams receive at least one possession in any playoff game that goes to overtime. Below, we will discuss the differences between the overtime rules for the regular season compared to the NFL playoffs. Regular Season Overtime Rules. In the regular season, NFL games that are tied after four quarters go to a 10-minute overtime period. 
Super Bowl LI, which saw the New England Patriots overcome a 28-3 deficit to force overtime, and then win the game on the opening possession of OT with a touchdown. 
Super Bowl overtime functions in much the same way as it does during the regular season. When the NFL amended the rules in 2010, they made it so both teams had a chance to possess the ball, except  
Super Bowl LVIII in February of 2024 was played under the NFL’s current playoff overtime rules. The 49ers won the toss, chose to receive and kicked a field goal on their first possession. 
Yo I was playing Superstar mode in madden 24. The game was tied and we went into overtime. The CPU’s team got to receive the ball first. The CPU went on to score and boom the game was over. WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THE FUCKING NEW OVERTIME RULE DUMB FUCKING MADDEN????? U FUCKING SCREWED ME OVER SO HARD. 
So if your still reading this overthought and probably flawed analysis, in the current rules the coin toss winner has a +2 advantage. In your purposed rules, the coin toss winner has a +4 advantage. This is due to them getting the ball first if it gets to sudden death, which is the most likely outcome,. 
I’ve worked in the national sports tv industry for a few years and also have gotten to work on a Super Bowl project. It’s largely dependent on the network/ client but the other comments are right in that the airing schedule is predetermined and they’ve definitely planned for overtime.

I just posted this because this section was kind of mind blowing to me that the 49ers players didn't know the new playoff OT rules. Multiple San Francisco players said after the game that they were not aware that the overtime rules are different in the playoffs than they are in the regular season, and strategy discussions over how to hand 
With the Super Bowl coming up, let's take a deeper statistical look into the matchup. Record/Strength of Schedule/Quality Wins Kansas City had a 12-4 record, while San Francisco had a 13-3 record in the regular season. 
In the extraordinarily rare event that a super bowl were to exceed 5-6 overtimes, the NFL would probably pause the game and then continue it at a later date, most likely 1-7 days later. The game wouldn’t become boring, people would be able to watch it, and the NFL could make even more money on ads. 
According the wording in the rules, you always play to the end of a period. "If the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended — the teams will play another overtime period. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined." 
But that rule ended in 2022, so there's really no excuse to make that mistake. The 49ers coach knew the current overtime rule when he selected to take the ball first on the coin flip. Commentators weren't sure why he chose that at the time (the Chiefs knew what they needed to score to win, on their drive), but it wasn't because of mistaken rules. 
Got the ball 1st / received. Against the reigning Super Bowl champions— whom this new OT rule was made for. Went for a FG on 4th instead of the TD. This calls into question the post game narrative of a winded defense. Why would he not maximize points? He clearly trusted his defense to stop the reigning Super Bowl MVP in overtime </p>
