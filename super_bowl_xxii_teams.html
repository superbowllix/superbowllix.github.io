        <h2><strong>super bowl xxii teams super bowl 2025 post malone</strong></h2>
        <p>The primary storyline surrounding Super Bowl XXII was that Washington's Doug Williams was the first African-American quarterback ever to start in a Super Bowl. This was even more meaningful given that the Redskins had been among the last teams to sign a black player after they reentered the league. 
The Jets' most recent championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002

Super Bowl XXII. By the 1987-88 season, teams were having trouble selling out stadiums, and viewership dropped 20%. Teams also played fewer regular-season games due to another players’ strike, taking to the field 15 times rather than the standard 16, with many starting players sitting out during negotiations. 
Super Bowl XXII was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Washington Redskins and American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1987 season. The Redskins defeated the Broncos by the score of 42–10, winning their second Super Bowl. The game was played on January 31, 1988, at

The game was also the third rematch between Super Bowl teams after Super Bowl XIII and Super Bowl XVII. This was the Bengals' second Super Bowl appearance after finishing the regular season with a 12–4 record. The 49ers were making their third Super Bowl appearance after posting a 10–6 regular season record.

Super Bowl 23. By the time the NFL penned Super Bowl XXIII into the schedule, the San Francisco 49ers were asserting themselves as a dynasty. The 49ers — led by two-time Super Bowl MVP Joe Montana — were looking to go three for three on their Super Bowl appearances, the first of which was seven years earlier. 
Today we have Super Bowl XXII, which was held on January 31, 1988, between the third-time AFC champion Denver Broncos and the fourth-time NFC champion Washington Redskins at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, California, the second straight Super Bowl in southern California. 
Over the 59-year history of the Super Bowl, only nine teams have successfully defended their title. Going even further, no team in NFL history has won three straight Super Bowls. The Chiefs will  </p>
