        <h2><strong>black super bowl qb winners kc chiefs super bowl games</strong></h2>
        <p>In the National Football League’s (NFL) history, three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. In 1988, Doug Williams, who played for Washington, made history as the first Black QB to win the NFL’s biggest game. Decades later, Russell Wilson would lead the Seattle Seahawks to victory in 2014 and, most recently, Patrick Mahomes of Kansas City won 2019’s Super Bowl after a standout  
Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320  
In Super Bowl XXII, he threw for 340 yards and four touchdowns, earning MVP honors. His legacy as a pioneer for Black quarterbacks remains unmatched. Steve McNair (Tennessee Titans) – SB XXXIV  
It would be another 26 years before another starting Black quarterback won a Super Bowl game. In the title game following the 2013 season, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson dominated Super Bowl 48 against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, leading his team to a 43-8 win to become the world champions. 
The upstart Eagles star was right: Only seven other Black quarterbacks have taken the Super Bowl stage as starters since the big game's inception at the end of the 1966 season. 
Wilson was the first Black quarterback to appear in two Super Bowls. Heading into Super Bowl XLVIII the Seahawks were considered the underdogs facing the Broncos, led by the legendary, Peyton Manning. 
The first Black quarterback to start a Super Bowl was also the first to be taken in the first round of the NFL Draft.. Selected by Tampa Bay with the No. 17 overall pick in 1978, Doug Williams took the Buccaneers to the postseason three times in five years before a messy divorce led to his exit from the NFL. 
What started with Marlin Briscoe — the first Black starting quarterback in NFL history — and Doug Williams — the first Black quarterback to start in a Super Bowl MVP — has evolved to a  
Two more Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl since: Russell Wilson with the Seattle Seahawks in 2014 and Patrick Mahomes with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020. Williams was the first, a  
Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was the seventh black quarterback to start a Super Bowl. [30] The combined Super Bowl records of black quarterbacks is 5–7. Williams and Mahomes are to date the only players to win the Super Bowl MVP award. [31] 
For many, Williams winning the Super Bowl remains the most singular achievement by a Black QB. It is on par with Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball and Jesse Owens winning the  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
From 1988 to 2019, five more Black quarterbacks played the Super Bowl, but only Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks led his team to a win – 43-8 against the Denver Broncos (just like Doug Williams) in Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014. He and the team returned to the Super Bowl in 2015 but failed to beat the New England Patriots. 
The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom Brady leads the pack with seven titles, three clear of any other quarterback, while  
Two Black quarterbacks in the Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and the Eagles' Jalen Hurts isn’t a story line for Super Bowl LIX, and that’s a beautiful act of resistance and acceptance. 
Super Bowl. Bart Starr (QB) Green Bay Packers. I. Bart Starr (QB) Green Bay Packers. II.  Throughout his career, he has written about collegiate sports, NFL Draft, Super Bowl champions, and  
Williams won Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to win the award. “I know a lot of people wanted to make it about me,” Williams said. “Being Black and playing in the Super Bowl, that was great. But, for me, I just happened to be the quarterback of the Washington Redskins, who just happened to be Black. 
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
No matter who wins, the first Super Bowl with 2 Black quarterbacks will make history With Jalen Hurts under center for the Eagles and Patrick Mahomes helming the Chiefs, Sunday's game will mark a  </p>
