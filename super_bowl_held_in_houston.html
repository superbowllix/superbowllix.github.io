        <p>This was the second Super Bowl to be held at NRG Stadium, the other being Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, which also featured the New England Patriots against that season's NFC South champion Carolina Panthers. It was also the third time the Super Bowl has been played in Houston, with Super Bowl VIII in 1974 having been held at Rice Stadium. 
Houston has been the host of three Super Bowls, including the 2017 game, Super Bowl LI. The city last hosted the game in 2004, which was the first time Houston hosted the game in 30 years. 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
A lot has changed since Houston hosted its first Super Bowl -- Super Bowl VIII -- in 1974. More than 71,000 fans gathered at Rice University Stadium to watch the Miami Dolphins play the Minnesota

See also the list of Super Bowl winners listed by year. Florida have hosted the most Super Bowls, with a total of 17 (11 in the Miami area, five in Tampa, and one in Jacksonville). In terms of cities, Miami has hosted the Super Bowls with 11, a total which will be matched by New Orleans in 2025. See the Super Bowl hosts cities list. 
According to reports, Houston appeared to be the front-runner in 1991 to land Super Bowl XXIX for January 1995. The exploding scoreboard at the Dome had long been removed and replaced with extra  
The celebration didn't last long, though, because Houston had less than two years to prepare for Super Bowl VIII, which would be played on Jan. 13, 1974, at Rice Stadium. 
The 2017 Super Bowl LI was the 51st Super Bowl in American football played at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on Feb 5, 2017. This was the third Super Bowl to be held in Houston, the city previously hosted the event in 1974 and 2004. The game was played between the AFC champions New England Patriots and the NFC champions Atlanta Falcons. 
NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXXVIII to Houston during their November 1, 2000, meeting held in Atlanta. It marked the second Super Bowl held in the Houston area, the first was VIII played at Rice Stadium. [10] Three Super Bowls host sites were selected during the meeting, XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XL.

It was also the first Super Bowl game played on the then-popular AstroTurf artificial playing surface, not surprising since Houston's Astrodome was the first facility to install AstroTurf in 1966. (Super Bowl V and Super Bowl VI, the first two Super Bowls played on artificial turf were played the competing Poly-Turf brand.) 
It was Super Bowl VIII, held in Houston in on January 13, 1974. The Miami Dolphins took on the Minnesota Vikings in Rice Stadium. The Super Bowl was still in its infancy.
