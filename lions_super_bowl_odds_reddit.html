        <p>Per Fanduel, the playoff-bound Pittsburgh Steelers are at +13000 odds (130-1) to win the Super Bowl. This is lower than the Panthers' Super Bowl odds entering the season (+8000). upvotes · comments 
Two things relative to the Lions that I'm having a hard time believing: Dallas is twice as likely to win the Super Bowl - Even if you believe that Dallas is a better team, you can't say that their path is easier seeing as they are most likely going into the playoffs as a wild card.

The Detroit Lions clinched the NFC's No. 1 seed with a Week 18 win over the Minnesota Vikings, and they entered the playoffs as the Super Bowl favorite.

Based on their +250 moneyline odds, the Lions have an implied probability of 28.57% of beating the 49ers and advancing to Super Bowl 58. Odds refresh periodically and are subject to change. You  
Last year, the Lions came the closest they’ve ever been to the Super Bowl, holding a 17-point lead at halftime over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game before letting the game  
I’m 100% full of kool aid optimism and yes, having a better team helps your odds but man the NFL is so whacky sometimes it could be anybody, we could be watching the giants fall backwards into a wildcard only to lose in the super bowl to a completely receiver less mahomes to concrete their dynasty, it would be fucking terrible but it’s  
Before the season started, I took the Lions to win the Super Bowl at +2100. Currently a cash out would return $1.70 on the dollar. That's obviously not a great return given the potential for much more with only two wins standing in their way, but I also realize the Lions have an uphill climb this weekend against the 49ers and have tall odds even just to win that game. 
The question really isn't "who has the highest likelihood of winning super bowl 59", it was about value, and the Browns looked way stronger this year than their record and seed, and the Colts probably should have won that division this year and will be much stronger in 2024.

Introduction: The Detroit Lions, a team long known for their resilience and unwavering spirit, defied all odds in 2024 to capture their first-ever Super Bowl championship. Overcoming years of adversity and building upon a strong found 
Vegas odds imply a 1.5% chance of DET vs. HOU Super Bowl, based on the combined odds of Lions winning the NFC and Texans winning the AFC. It's super unlikely (as is any individual matchup). 
I’ve been tracking the Superbowl odds every week since the start of the season. Odds are all pulled from DraftKings before each week kicks off on Thursdays. So the latest odds are the odds entering Week 7. I cut the chart off at +10,000 because it’s too hard to read otherwise. So the bottom teams have fallen off already. 
Lions (+900) Packers (+3000) Buccaneers (+3300) Texans (+3300) Source: FanDuel For those unfamiliar with how these odds work, the number represents how much you'd win if you bet $100 on that team and they won the Super Bowl.

The more I learned about spreads odds futures parlays and betting the less I wanted to risk money on it. I monitor spreads and odds for different reasons like “do we realllllly have a chance” I went to Vegas in ‘14 for other reasons but I bet the Entire NFL Schedule that weekend to try, and got killed. Probably good in the long run. 
Now that the NFL playoff field is set, all eyes are on Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans. Fourteen teams still have their championship dreams alive, but only one will walk away with the Lombardi Trophy  
Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money. </p>
