        <h2><strong>super bowl audience vs world cup super bowl first touchdown scorer odds</strong></h2>
        <p>The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
When it comes down to the international TV audience, revenue generated per game and even the pay that winning players receive, the World Cup vs Super Bowl debate has a clear winner. The World Cup  
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
And in the case of the World Cup finale, it’s a national-team match with a built-in global audience on hundreds of channels while the Super Bowl is played on one domestic network, and some  
The FIFA World Cup Final in 2018, which featured young phenom Kylian Mbappe and France defeating Croatia by a thrilling score of 4-2, had 3.57 billion viewers, per FIFA. For comparison, the 2022  
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
What is watched more, the Super Bowl or the World Cup? The Super Bowl LVIII had 62.5 million television viewers, as reported by the NFL, making it one of the most-watched single-day sporting events in the world. 
The Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup wield considerable cultural and social influence, though in different contexts. In the U.S., the Super Bowl has become a cultural phenomenon. Super Bowl Sunday is an unofficial national holiday, with parties, family gatherings, and special events taking place across the country. 
In spite of the Super Bowl being the most viewed annual sporting event on TV, the World Cup has the bigger global audience. TV Revenues. The Super Bowl pulls in larger sums of TV advertising revenue than the World Cup, and there are a number of reasons attributed to this. 
To give you a sense of just how huge, we visualized a comparison of viewership, looking at how many people watched the Super Bowl this year compared with the number of viewers of the final match of the last World Cup. If you had any doubt about the popularity of soccer in the rest of the world, let those doubts be dashed: 
Super Bowl vs World Cup; who has more viewers? Soccer (or football) fans have blind faith that there is nothing bigger than the World Cup in the whole universe, especially when it comes to viewers. 
How many viewers does the Super Bowl get? In comparison to the men’s FIFA World Cup final, not many at all. But from a United States-based audience perspective, it is the most-watched TV  
FIFA World Cup Final Beat Super Bowl LVI By More Than One BILLION Viewers In TV Ratings / FIFA has claimed that around 1.5 billion people watched the 2022 World Cup final live on television. 
How does the Super bowl viewership compare to the ICC World Cup 2019 final? The ICC World Cup 2019 was played between England and New Zealand. It turned out to be the most closely-fought match in cricket history, where a total of 2 Super Overs weren't enough to decide the winner of the match. 
According to Roadtrips.com five billion people watch the World Cup Final, while the Super Bowl is actually the 8th most-watched event with 115 million views. Finishing above NFL's showpiece are the Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, Women's World Cup, Olympic Games, Winter Games and the Champions League Final. 
On Sunday, the 2022 FIFA World Cup begins in Qatar. Its final matchup, the World Cup Final, is the Super Bowl of the association football. Or maybe the Super Bowl is the World Cup Final of American football? See the comparison below, and decide for yourself. 
Yes: Super Bowl viewership might exceed World Cup viewership on a single game basis, but World Cup viewership will be in the billions by 2026. Three North American countries, a new format, lots of  
Following a graphic that contrasted Super Bowl viewing with FIFA World Cup watching, the sports world had a lot to say on Twitter. An infographic comparing the viewership of both big sporting events was published by the well-known Twitter account @nocontextfooty. The image shows the viewership of the Super Bowl to that of the FIFA World Cup. 
The fairest comparison would be the UEFA Champions League Final - which has 450 million global viewers. Superbowl is impressive at 155, but 115 of those are in the USA. 
As the world cup is broadcasted in hundreds of countries, it's probably tricky to get an exact number, that's why we're just talking estimates, but I think the point stands, there are a lot more people viewing the World Cup than the Super Bowl (which is probably only a mild surprise as the Super Bowl is mostly a national event, while the World  </p>
