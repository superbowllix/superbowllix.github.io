        <h2><strong>team without super bowl wins super bowl predictions score</strong></h2>
        <p>That is even more crazy when you think about how 12 NFL teams have never won even one Super Bowl. Let’s take a look at those 12 teams and see how close they’ve come to getting off this list  
The Vikings are easily the most successful team on this list: Their 54.5% win percentage in the regular season ranks eighth all-time, and their four Super Bowl appearances are tied for the 13th  
Most Super Bowl appearances without a win. The Vikings and Bills have each appeared four times in the Super Bowl without a victory to their name. The Vikings' most recent appearance came in 1977  
A. 8 teams have Super Bowl appearances without victories. These teams are the Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Carolina Panthers, Atlanta Falcons, Los Angeles Chargers  
In two appearances, Atlanta fell short in Super Bowl 33 and lost more famously in Super Bowl 51. The New England Patriots would win that game after the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead. 
Cleveland Browns. The Browns won four NFL championships pre-merger (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964), but have never won a Super Bowl. Cleveland’s 1964 championship was the city’s most recent title  
Oldest NFL team without a Super Bowl win. No franchise has been held without a Super Bowl win longer than the Cardinals, who have existed in some capacity as an NFL franchise since 1920, picked up  
What Team Has Lost the Most Super Bowls? The Denver Broncos and New England Patriots have each lost five Super Bowls, the most among all teams. The Buffalo Bills and Minnesota Vikings are tied for the most Super Bowl losses (four) without a win. The Broncos are 3-5 in eight Super Bowl appearances, while the Patriots are 6-5 in 11 appearances. 
The Cardinals are the oldest NFL team without a Super Bowl win. The franchise has been in the NFL in some form since 1920, yet they have never held the Lombardi Trophy. Twenty years before the Super Bowl era got underway, Arizona won an NFL title in 1947. The Cardinals did play in Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, but they lost to the Pittsburgh  
In the first year that the squad was called the “Tennessee Titans,” the team made it to the Super Bowl in the 1998-1999 season but fell to the Rams 23-16. A last-second Kevin Dyson dive to the end zone to tie the game came up short, and the Titans were left without a Super Bowl victory.

The longest currently active Super Bowl drought belongs to the Arizona Cardinals, who have gone 77 seasons without winning the Super Bowl. This drought pre-dates the modern Super Bowl era, so before 1966 the drought also counts seasons since they last won the NFL Championship. 
The Patriots and Steelers each have six Super Bowl wins, followed by the Cowboys and 49ers with five apiece. How many NFL teams have never been to a Super Bowl? Four franchises have never been to a Super Bowl: The Browns, Lions, Texans and Jaguars. Which team won the first Super Bowl? 
This list also counts all seasons since a team last won the league championship or Super Bowl. Of active NFL teams, 20 have won the Super Bowl, 7 have not won a Super Bowl, but have won an AFL or NFL championship pre-merger, and 5 have not won any championship or Super Bowl. 
The following is a list of all NFL teams without a single Super Bowl win. Arizona Cardinals. Atlanta Falcons. Buffalo Bills. Carolina Panthers. Cincinnati Bengals. Cleveland Browns. Detroit Lions. 
The Arizona Cardinals hold the honor of being the NFL’s oldest team without a Super Bowl win. Established in 1920, the Cardinals have just one NFL title to their name (1947). Their lone Super  
The annals of NFL history include 58 legendary and memorable Super Bowl matchups. Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers dominated the 1960s with championship wins in 1966 and 1967. Joe Namath did the  
This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos). 
In the first year that the squad was called the “Tennessee Titans,” the team made it to the Super Bowl in the 1998-1999 season but fell to the Rams 23-16. A last-second Kevin Dyson dive to the end zone to tie the game came up short, and the Titans were left without a Super Bowl victory. 
Teams without a Super Bowl win despite success in playoffs #1 - Minnesota Vikings - 21 playoff wins. The Minnesota Vikings are the most successful team in the history of the NFL playoffs to have  </p>
