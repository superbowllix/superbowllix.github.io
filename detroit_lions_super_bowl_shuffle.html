        <p>In 1985, on their way to an NFL championship, the Chicago Bears sold half a million copies of "The Super Bowl Shuffle" and just missed the Top 40, charting at #41. The thing is, members of the Detroit Lions football squad had recorded a song five years prior in 1980. 
"The Super Bowl Shuffle" is a song performed by the Chicago Bears football team (credited as the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew) in 1985. It was released in December 1985 on Chicago-based Red Label Records and distributed through Capitol Records [2] seven weeks ahead of their win in Super Bowl XX. 
He was also a member of the "Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew" in the video "The Super Bowl Shuffle," which featured him pantomiming on the bass. In 2001, he was the running backs coach for the XFL's Chicago Enforcers until the league folded. [2] [3] Later that year he was hired as a BLESTO regional scout for the Detroit Lions until 2011. [4] 
Super Bowl LIX will be played in New Orleans on Sunday at the Superdome.  Four teams have never played in the Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions,  “The Super Bowl Shuffle  
The Super Bowl Shuffle Production Released by Red Label Records and distributed through Capitol Records two months ahead of the Super Bowl, the song quickly blew up in popularity . Although not played often on the radio, over 500,000 copies of the song were sold, and was number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February of 1986, and was nominated  
Ever since the Super Bowl became the biggest stage in American sports in 1967, the Lions have not had the best history. However, change has come in Detroit and it warrants a deeper look. To begin, it took the Lions three years to make their first Super Bowl playoff appearance in 1970. That being  
The Lions are one of 12 NFL teams that do not have any Super Bowl wins in franchise history. Yet while Detroit does not have a Super Bowl to its name, the franchise has won an NFL championship. 
The Detroit Lions have never played in a Super Bowl. If they win Saturday against the Washington Commanders they'll be one step closer. Long-suffering Lions fans have waited decades for this moment. 
The Lions have been left out of the Super Bowl party for over 66 years. Detroit has long awaited the return of a top football team, and the 2024 Lions are just that. This team has so many things that it does so well that it has become incredibly hard not to consider them a Super Bowl favorite. Detroit has arguably the best offense in the entire  
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. 
Tim Twentyman covers all the Detroit Lions news of the day including injuries on the offensive line, preparing for the home opener and more. 
Both teams lead their respective conferences after Week 9 – Kansas City in the AFC and Detroit in the NFC – putting them in prime position at the halfway mark of the season to make Super Bowl  
Second-year linebacker Jack Campbell has been the one constant all season for the Detroit Lions in a linebacker room that has been anything but. That room has been decimated by injury and forced to shuffle around and sign new players more than any other position for the Lions so far this season. 
Prince is a former college offensive coordinator at Boise State. He joined Jim Caldwell's staff in 2014 and was retained by Patricia in 2018. He's in his seventh season as Lions receivers coach and 13th NFL season overall.

Jackson went to the Pro Bowl as an alternate in 2021. The Lions re-signed Graham Glasgow, their primary starting right guard last season, at the start of free agency, but could shuffle personnel  
They know the Detroit Lions’ Super Bowl odds just fell off the Ambassador Bridge. Two more critical defensive pieces went down Sunday against Buffalo. Star lineman Alim McNeill tore his ACL.
