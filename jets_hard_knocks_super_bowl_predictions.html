        <p>Hardman predicted the Jets would beat  wait for it  the 49ers 31 to 21 to win the Super Bowl. Of course, that didn’t happen. The New York Jets didn’t make the Super Bowl. But Mecole Hardman, the player that Oz the Mentalist randomly chose out of all the Jets players, did make the Super Bowl, with the Kansas City Chiefs. In fact, he  
With the Super Bowl 58 matchup set between the Chiefs and the 49ers, another fun but mind-boggling theory is making its way around the football world thanks to a preseason "Hard Knocks" clip  
The second episode of HBO’s “Hard Knocks:  Pearlman asked Mecole Hardman for his Super Bowl prediction. The wide receiver chose the San Francisco 49ers as the NFC team they would face for  
However, while it’s a stirring prediction that was seen in the latest Hard Knocks, it should be noted that in 2022 it was envisioned the Ravens would trounce the Atlanta Falcons 35-14. Of course, two different teams played in Super Bowl 57. But still, Hardman and Pearlman did enough to catch the attention and blow minds in the newest episode. 
Mecole Hardman brings the Super Bowl LVIII winning mentality to this team . As the mentalist carried on with his performance, it provided a segue for others to look into the Jets' Super Bowl LVIII

The Jets were chosen to be the team followed on HBO’s Hard Knocks. The second episode of the show aired on Tuesday night, which featured a clip of Hardman predicting the Super Bowl matchup for  
The segment ended with this bold prediction: Jets 31, 49ers 21 in Super Bowl 58.  “Got carried away watching hard knocks and booked my Super Bowl flight. @49ers taking it this year, and  
Episode 1 of Hard Knocks 2023 promised a lot with Aaron Rodgers and the New York Jets being featured, and it certainly did not disappoint. It acts as yet another marker that the new season is near. 
Jets' Super Bowl prediction American mentalist Oz Pearlman started off this week's show, where he performed magic tricks for the players that involved everything from puzzles, cards, and even a  
As a 49er fan who lives in NYC and has the Jets as his other team, this would be a nightmare. But I've seen the 49ers win 4 SB in my lifetime and I'm not sure I'll live to see a Jets SB. So it would be hard not to root for the Jets but it would be painful because the 49ers are my first team. Let's pray this never happens.
