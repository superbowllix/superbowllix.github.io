Each year, every NFL team’s goal is to win the Super Bowl. However, only one team can win it, and just two will appear in it. Some teams, obviously, make that appearance more than others. Here’s a list of Super Bowl appearances by team, arranged alphabetically and chronologically from the most recent to the earliest trip. 
Super Bowl XLI, played on Feb. 4, 2007, pitted the Bears against the Indianapolis Colts.
