        <p>In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17. [ 99 ] On September 26, 2012, following a 31–30 loss to the Baltimore Ravens , Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official's arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly  
As the head coach of the Patriots, Belichick first suffered a loss in Super Bowl XLII when Eli Manning and the Giants upset them 14-17. Next up was Super Bowl XLVI when the same combination of  
Two of his three Super Bowl losses came to the Giants and another was at the hands of the Philadelphia Eagles. Bill Belichick record with Patriots Belichick went 266-121 in the regular season. 
During Belichick’s tenure under Parcells, the Giants won two Super Bowls (1986,1990) and made the playoffs three other seasons. The 1986 Giants is considered one of the greatest NFL teams ever with a defensive unit led by MVP linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Following the 1990 Super Bowl victory, Belichick accepted his first head coaching position.

Eli Manning and the Giants are also the only team to defeat the Brady-Belichick combination in the Super Bowl. During both the 2007 and 2011 seasons, the Giants topped the Patriots in the Super Bowl. 
The Giants defeated the Broncos in Super Bowl XXI and the Bills in Super Bowl XXV before Belichick left for his first head coaching gig with the Browns. Belichick stayed in Cleveland for five  
The Giants defeated Belichick-coached Browns teams in 1991 and 1994, and the Patriots in Gillette Stadium in 2011. The Giants lost regular-season games in 2003, 2007 and 2011, though the latter two seasons ended with the more significant Super Bowl triumphs. 
Four years before his drastic change in game plan helped win Giants Super Bowl XXV, Bill Belichick's Big Blue defenders were carrying their defensive coordinator off field following shutout of  
He won his first two Super Bowls as defensive coordinator for the New York Giants in 1986 and 1990 before claiming six Super Bowl championships with the Patriots. Belichick launched his coaching career in 1975 with the Baltimore Colts and continued as an assistant coach with Detroit (1976-77), Denver (1978) and the New York Giants (1979-1990). 
The 1990 Super Bowl champion Giants found success largely through a defense that manhandled most opponents. That unit ranked second in the NFL (behind a 9-7 Pittsburgh Steelers team that didn't make the playoffs), allowing just 262.9 yards a game. 
Before Bill Belichick won five Super Bowls with the Patriots, he was the brains behind the Giants’ 1986 and 1990 Super Bowl champion defenses. Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports 
Patriots head coach Bill Belichick takes a look back at his 12 year tenure as an assistant coach for the New York Giants where he won two of his five Super Bowl rings. 
Six Super Bowl wins. Bill Belichick, New England Patriots (Super Bowls 36, 38, 39, 49, 51 and 53) Four Super Bowl wins. Chuck Noll, Pittsburgh Steelers (Super Bowls 9, 10, 13 and 14) 
The Packers won the first two Super Bowls (1966 and 1967) but had to wait 30 years for the next win, which came in Super Bowl XXXI. The team’s most recent Super Bowl victory capped off the 2010  
Bill Belichick is among the best coaches in the history of the NFL. He won six Super Bowl titles as head coach of the New England Patriots, and two more as an assistant coach with the New York Giants. 
Speaking of underdog, the other two memories of the four I mentioned Belichick was a part of, was Super Bowl XLII and Super Bowl XLVI, when the (David) Giants beat the (Goliath) Patriots in both games, to hoist the Lombardi trophy. As we sit today, the New York Giants have a massive opening with their defensive coordinator position available. 
Bill Belichick is synonymous with NFL greatness, but for New York Giants fans, he’s also the coach who twice fell short against Big Blue on the biggest stage. With six Super Bowl wins, nine  
The Giants served Belichick two of those three losses.  The Patriots were coming off one of their most famous Super Bowl wins — when they rallied from a 28-3 deficit to defeat the Atlanta  
2011 season. The Patriots finish the regular season 13-3 and earn a trip to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. But they are again thwarted by the Giants in a 21-17 loss. </p>
