        <p>During the 2023 Halftime Show Sunday (Feb. 12), Rihanna's backup dancers wore puffy white coats and matching pants ‚Äî an outfit many viewers joked looked like "marshmallows" or the Michelin Man. 
For 13 minutes last night, Rihanna was back.She danced, showed off her pregnancy bump, and reminded us about how vast and unforgettable her catalogue is. But even as she was elevated into the sky on a platform in a red Loewe jumpsuit and jacket, her 80 dancers held their own.

Another random idea we've come up with is that perhaps it was a homage to the 2021 Super Bowl's socially-distanced halftime show (via Mediaite). Surely you remember how The Weeknd trotted out his own lineup of backup dancers in poofy white outfits. 
On February 12 th 2023, pop icon Rihanna took the stage at Super Bowl LVII for a 13-minute musical performance, immediately going viral not only for her songs but also for the style and design of the performance itself. Styled by Jahleel Weaver in bright red, the singer stood out from her 280 backup dancers who wore stark white puffers.
