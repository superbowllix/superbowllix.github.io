            <p>The Evolution of Super Bowl Halftime Performances</p>
        </div>

    <section id="about">
        <h2><strong>super bowl performers reddit super bowl halftime show 25</strong></h2>
        <p>In a few years, I can see Doja Cat crushing the Super Bowl. She's already a good live performer, just needs more time to build her catalog. I know they offered Adele the position a few years ago and that would be a fascinating show to see at the Super Bowl. 
At the end of that particular performance, Prince covers "Best of You" by Foo Fighters. This was a friendly "fuck you" to Foo for covering "Darling Nikki" without Princes' permission. In the most Prince-esque way, he found a way to retaliate by covering their own song on one of the "biggest" stages in the world. 
We have different definitions of irrelevant I think. Most Super Bowl performers are legacy artists because you need an entire career’s worth of hits to pull it off. Someone like P!nk may not be “trendy” but irrelevant seems like a stretch. I thought we were talking about like Bebe Rexha tier people. 
The memes flooding my feed facilitated so many trips to Chipotle at this point I’m convinced it was one of the greatest marketing schemes of all time. Adam not fully transforming into a Chipotle Bag has actually been surprising, I thought the Super Bowl was a career transition for him into the food industry! 
If they play the recipe and love game i’ll eat my shoe. Those feel like way too deep cuts for the super bowl. Not that i’d hate it tho! Loyalty feels like a rando pick? I’d guess some combo/medley of Humble, m.A.A.d. city, Swimming pools, Alright. But i’d take anything really. 
Labels likely pay for it as well. No publicity is bad publicity . "Maroon 5 is facing backlash for signing on for the Super Bowl, here's Girls Like You on 202501 FLZ." It sells. It increases buzz. The Super Bowl is incredibly intuitive for popular artists. I think doing the SB in 2019 is bad though. Wait until 2020 so on when the backlash has  
The NFL has never paid their Super Bowl half time performers. As far as the NFL is concerned, they're providing a platform of 100 to 120 million domestic eyeballs, plus another 50 million or so abroad, primarily in Canada and Mexico. That is a level of exposure the performer will never, ever, ever, ever get anywhere else. 
It's about putting the idea fresh into your head. As a musician and really any brand, you want to constantly be reminding people of you and your music. Cause even a few thousand extra ticket sales from being the halftime performer of the super bowl is exposure beyond what you can get in most other ways. 
TIL That the crowd during the Super Bowl halftime show do not have tickets to the game and the performers are paid nothing. The NFL justifies the lack of earnings by saying the performers will make it back in download revenue. 
Rihanna's catalog is amazing and her hits are undeniably great, but IMO the show really fell short in terms of spectacle. Other halftime performers elevated their hits by performing them in a noteworthy fashion, but Rihanna's performance was literally rescued by the music rather than augmenting it or bringing anything new to the table. 
A No Doubt/Gwen Stefani performance could also do well since they had a great reception at Coachella and have a wide audience with A LOT of hits. Or it can be a rapper coalition like the Dre Super Bowl because Lil Wayne is a Louisiana native. 
Want to add - I heard that the powers that be who run the Super Bowl half time show don’t allow artists to sing live anymore. It’s a policy, in their eyes it’s too risky to chance it. Which makes it frustrating when people criticize artists for not singing live. 
I didn’t say he was out of the question. He’s a megastar, he has the hits and he’s one of the best live performers of his generation. BUT and it’s a big BUT. His stadium shows and his live technique with the acoustic guitar and the loop pedal is a very unique thing that I don’t see necessarily translating to a Super Bowl.

Consider this, companies that want to advertise during the super bowl pay millions for just 30 seconds Performers are companies as well with a product to sell, they get a entire showcase on the field for free. That is a huge value to them. 
The Super Bowl Halftime Show is one of the most prestigious concerts in music. Who will hit the stage at Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9? Below, you’ll find Super Bowl 2025 Halftime Show information, including performers, time, guest appearances, and rumors. Who Is Performing At The Super Bowl 2025 Halftime Show? Super Bowl LIX. 
This is rather ironic because playing the Super Bowl Halftime show is considered one of the pinnacles of a pop star’s career. This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). 
The Super Bowl Halftime Show is the most watched musical event (at least in America) each year. Over 100 million people watch it live just in the US (about 1/3 of the population), plus however many millions of people watch it later and/or outside of the US. 
Not a Chiefs fan, but I am ANIMATING my favorite play from every team! I was pretty shocked I didn't pick a Mahomes play also haha. This guy though was arguably one of the greatest at his craft, I don't think he is talked about enough to be honest with you. P.S. this my guess of Champ's least favs 
Madonna's one was total lip sync, from start to finish, Shakira didn't lip synced Empire and Waka Waka, JLo intro was Live and the rest till Born In The USA was lipsync, also, Bruno Mars &amp; Beyoncé didn't lipsync any super bowl performance as well Prince and the rock bands from the 00's halftime shows </p>
