        <h2><strong>super bowl performers are not paid super bowl macclesfield soft play</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl halftime show, despite hosting some of the world's biggest stars and attracting massive audiences, does not pay its performers. However, there's a specific reason for it. What began as a way to keep fans entertained during the Super Bowl's midgame break gradually evolved into a major spectacle. 
Rihanna will not be paid to perform at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show on Sunday. The singer and beauty mogul is set to take the stage on Sunday, February 12, at halftime but won't be getting  
The NFL once looked at whether musicians would pay for the privilege because the Super Bowl halftime performance has such enormous value and is seen by over 100 million people. According to estimates, the production expenditures for Beyoncé’s unpaid 2013 performance came to over $600,000. 
The Weeknd rehearses for the Super Bowl LV Halftime Show at Raymond James Stadium on February 04, 2021. Kevin Mazur/Getty. In 2021, the NFL was criticized for not paying dancers fairly as half the  
The NFL's check will not be a major concern to Dr. Dre—whose net worth was $800 million in 2019, according to Forbes—but the question of who does and doesn't get paid for the Super Bowl  
Super Bowl halftime performers are paid the union-rate minimum. For Usher, that meant $671 for the actual performance last year and about $1,800 for the rehearsals leading up to the Super Bowl. 
Five years ago, Joanna Hunter of the NFL said to Forbes: "We do not pay the artists. We cover expenses and production costs." When Beyonce first performed at the Super Bowl without a fee in 2013  
Despite the euphoria surrounding the event, entertainers do not get paid to play the Super Bowl. At least not what they usually make. They only make union scale for the performances, according to  
Rihanna Did Not Get Paid for Jaw-Dropping Super Bowl Halftime Show — Here's Why. Halftime show performers may not receive a paycheck for their high-profile sets, but the NFL does cover  
Mary J. Blige was not paid for her Super Bowl Halftime Show performance in 2022—but neither was anyone else who took the stage with her. Next, Relive the Best Super Bowl Halftime Shows of All  
NFL players make, on average, $3.2 million per year. That number is up from 2024 when the average was $2.8 million. But even that number varies if you account for the wide discrepancy in salary  
According to a Sports Illustrated report, Usher was paid "$671 for the actual performance last year and about $1,800 for the rehearsals leading up to the Super Bowl." 
Wild, but true. Historically, the NFL doesn't pay Super Bowl halftime performers, but that's because the coveted 13-minute slot is essentially A) a free concert smack in the middle of a football  
How much do Super Bowl performers get paid? The NFL may cover travel costs for artists, but maintains its long-standing tradition of not paying performers for the pregame and halftime shows beyond  
Believe it or not, Super Bowl halftime performers don't get paid much. "There is not an appearance fee," NFL Vice President of Communications Brian McCarthy tells ThePioneerWoman.com. "But the artists are paid union scale." 
During the Super Bowl 56 halftime show in Los Angeles three years ago, Lamar performed alongside other West Coast and rap/R&amp;B icons: Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J. Blige. 
Just a few years ago, the league floated the idea of making artists pay to perform at the Super Bowl. That did not sit well with artists. “I put my foot down very early in the courtship,” Katy Perry told The Associated Press in 2015 after her Super Bowl halftime performance. “I said, ‘Look guys, here’s where I draw a line in the sand.’

It's about putting the idea fresh into your head. As a musician and really any brand, you want to constantly be reminding people of you and your music. Cause even a few thousand extra ticket sales from being the halftime performer of the super bowl is exposure beyond what you can get in most other ways. </p>
