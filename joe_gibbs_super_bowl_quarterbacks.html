        <p>Joseph Jackson Gibbs (born November 25, 1940) is an American auto racing team owner and former football coach. He served as the head coach of the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) from 1981 to 1992 and then 2004 to 2007, leading them to nine playoff appearances, five NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowl wins over 16 seasons. 
Joe Gibbs served as a college and pro football assistant for 15 seasons before winning his first head coaching job with the 1981 Washington Redskins. During a 12-year term that ended after the 1992 season, the Gibbs-led Redskins won the NFC title in the strike-shortened 1982 season and NFC East Division championships in 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1991. 
The second triumph in an NFL championship game followed in January 1988 with a rout of the Denver Broncos, and Gibbs scored his hat trick in Super Bowl 26 by downing the Buffalo Bills.

The Redskins were one of the NFL’s great teams in the 1980s under the leadership of head coach Joe Gibbs. They went to consecutive Super Bowls behind quarterback Joe Theisman, and won it all in 1982. Another NFC East title followed in 1984 before losing to the Chicago Bears.
