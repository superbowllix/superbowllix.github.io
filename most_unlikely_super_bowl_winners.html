This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers ) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos ). 
After a 7-9 2016 season, the Eagles entered the '17 slate as the ninth-most likely NFC team to qualify for Super Bowl LII. At plus-4000, Philly was viewed as a middle-of-the-road team.

10 Most Unlikely Super Bowl Winners Ever. Story by Alex Hoegler • 11mo. 1 / 11 
Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. T1) New England Patriots, 6. XXVI (2002) 20-17 vs. St. Louis  
How do the Foxes compare to other unlikely champions? Here are the top 10 most improbable title winners in sports history. 10. 2001 Patriots.  Before Super Bowl III,  
The 2007 Giants have been mentioned in this thread a couple of times as an unlikely team but that wasn't even the unlikeliest Giants team to make a run to the Super Bowl. Following their narrow victory in Super Bowl XXV, the Giants had a quiet decade in the 90s, with only two 10+ win seasons and one playoff win in that span coming in 1993. 
It is not surprising to anyone that the New England Patriots are once again in the Super Bowl . The Giants weren't expected to be in the Super Bowl, but it will not be a surprise if they win 
These are the 10 most unlikely playoff teams in the Super Bowl era, a ranking that was determined by preseason win totals, the team's record the previous year, and Super Bowl odds. 
Here are the 10 most unlikely players to win Super Bowl MVP of all-time.  While the MVP of the Super Bowl is generally a great player, there have been some very unlikely award winners. Players  
Rod Martin, Oakland Raiders LB: Super Bowl XV 6 of 20 Martin intercepted three passes as the Raiders claimed their second Superbowl with a 27-10 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans. 
Considered by many as one of the most outstanding regular-season quarterbacks, Manning solidified his status among the elite by securing his second Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl 50. Retiring as a five-time MVP, Manning held NFL records for most touchdowns (539) and passing yards (71,940), although these records have since been surpassed. 
One kinda crazy one, at least in the moment, was the 2015 Broncos. The last stretch, the future super bowl winners had a chance to be the #1 seed or completely out of the playoffs. I think the Bengals game + Philly and Miami beating the Patriots secured it, but it's crazy to think that 1 game could've really cost us. </p>
