        <h2><strong>quarterbacks to win super bowl in rookie year super bowl qb matchups</strong></h2>
        <p>NFL rookie QBs have a lowly .355 winning percentage in playoff games. NFL QBs who won the Super Bowl in their first year as starters. Two players have won the Super Bowl in their first year as  
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Marino never won a Super Bowl in his illustrious 17-year career, while Montana went on to win four with the 49ers. Ben Roethlisberger is the youngest QB to start and win a Super Bowl. 
There have been just five rookie quarterbacks to start in a conference championship game, and they all lost, falling one game short of a Super Bowl appearance. Buccaneers QB Shaun King became the  
Jayden Daniels is the sixth rookie quarterback to start conference championship games. The first was Shaun King with the Buccaneers in 2000, and Brock Purdy was the most recent in 2023. Ben  
The Youngest QB To Win The Super Bowl While no rookie has claimed a Super Bowl title, a young quarterback still holds the record for the youngest to do so. Ben Roethlisberger won Super Bowl XL in  
However, in its storied existence, not once has a rookie QB managed to win the Super Bowl as a starter. There are a number of reasons why it’s so difficult for a rookie QB to lead a team to the  
The answer: no. A rookie QB has NEVER won the Super Bowl. Tom Brady won a Super Bowl in his SECOND year in the league. After all, he was with the team in 2000, throwing three passes for one completion, and then won a Super Bowl the following year. Brady was not a rookie in 2001. Mahomes won a Super Bowl at an early age but was also not a rookie. 
NFL QBs who won the Super Bowl in their first year as a starter. Both Kurt Warner and Tom Brady won the Super Bowl in their first year as a starter. Warner led the Rams to a dramatic 23-16 victory over the Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV. It was his second year in the NFL after spending his rookie campaign in 1998 behind Tony Banks and Steve Bono on  
While no rookie has claimed a Super Bowl title, a young quarterback still holds the record for the youngest to do so. Ben Roethlisberger won Super Bowl XL in 2006 at just 23 years old. He led the Steelers to a 21-10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks with help from a dominant defense and wide receiver Hines Ward, who earned MVP honors. 
There are four second-year quarterbacks to start a Super Bowl who have gone on to actually win: Kurt Warner (1999), Tom Brady (2001), Ben Roethlisberger (2005) and Russell Wilson (2013). 
Has a Second-Year Quarterback Ever Won the Super Bowl? Four of the seven second-year quarterbacks to start a Super Bowl in their second season managed to lift the Lombardi Trophy. Those four are Warner, Brady, Roethlisberger, and Wilson. Warner’s Rams defeated the Tennessee Titans 23-16 in the game that ended with “The Tackle.” Brady  
The National Football League has been around for a long time. However, in its storied existence, not once has a rookie QB managed to win the Super Bowl as a starter. There are a number of reasons why it’s so difficult for a rookie QB to lead a team to the Super Bowl. First of all, rookie QBs tend to be drafted by teams that are rebuilding. 
Jayden Daniels has the Washington Commanders just one win away from the team’s first Super Bowl appearance since 1991. The first year quarterback has helped his team pull off two upsets so far this postseason, and will be looking for a third as he tries to become the first rookie QB to ever win (or even start) a Super Bowl. No Rookie  
Of the four rookie QBs who led their team to the conference championship game, none of them were able to advance to the title game. This Sunday, Brock Purdy can become the first rookie quarterback in NFL history to win a conference championship game and reach the Super Bowl. 
While the Packers are set to clash with the 49ers, the Texans will have a go against the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday in the AFC Divisional Round Game, determining whether Stroud, in his rookie season, could reach a conference championship or even a Super Bowl. 
There are four second-year quarterbacks to start a Super Bowl who have gone on to actually win: Kurt Warner (1999), Tom Brady (2001), Ben Roethlisberger (2005) and Russell Wilson (2013). 
Quarterback Jayden Daniels was preparing for the NFL draft this time last year. Now, he’s on the doorstep of the Super Bowl. The No. 2 overall pick has taken a Washington Commanders team that  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Warner also set a Super Bowl record by attempting 45 passes without a single interception. For his performance, Warner was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award. [24] Warner was the last player to win both the NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same year until Patrick Mahomes did so in Super Bowl LVII in the 2022 NFL season. </p>
