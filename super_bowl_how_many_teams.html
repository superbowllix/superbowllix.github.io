This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos). 
Super Bowl History 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest and most-watched sporting event in North America, with over 100 million viewers annually.  A guide to how many teams make the NFL Playoffs 
Each year, every NFL team’s goal is to win the Super Bowl. However, only one team can win it, and just two will appear in it. Some teams, obviously, make that appearance more than others. Here’s a list of Super Bowl appearances by team, arranged alphabetically and chronologically from the most recent to the earliest trip. 
Each winning team's Super Bowl rings, as of the 2010 season, on display in lead up to Super Bowl XLV. The Super Bowl is the annual league championship game of the National Football League (NFL) of the United States. 
The Super Bowl locations, dates, losing teams, and final scores are also included (1967-2024). The complete list of Super Bowl champions throughout NFL history. The Super Bowl locations, dates  
At the bottom, you can read up on the poor franchises that haven’t yet even appeared in the Super Bowl. Teams with the most Super Bowl wins: Patriots: 6. Overall Super Bowl record: 6-5.

As a result, commercial time during the game is the most expensive of the year; for example, in 2016 a 30-second spot cost approximately $4.8 million. 
How many NFL teams have played a Super Bowl at home? Only two teams have experienced a home Super Bowl, and both did it this decade: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams. Bizarrely enough  
NFL teams ranked by number of Super Bowl appearances all time 2024 Most Super Bowl wins by player 1967-2024 NFL teams ranked by playoff appearances all time 2024 
The Philadelphia Eagles can make quite a bit of history if they can defeat the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. With a win over the Chiefs, the Eagles can become one of just 16 teams that  
The Chiefs lost Super Bowl 1 and won Super Bowl 4 before enduring a 50-year championship game hiatus. The Chiefs have now appeared in the Super Bowl five times in the last six seasons. 
Out of 32 NFL franchises: 20 different teams have won the Super Bowl, and eight others have played in the big game but never won the championship. That leaves four franchises that are still vying  
The 2024-25 NFL playoffs are now here and this is when the race to the Super Bowl truly starts. Fourteen teams participate in the playoffs, hoping to win the Super Bowl. But how does the NFL playoff format work? DAZN News explains it all for the NFL playoffs, plus the fixtures for each round this  
How did each NFL team that played a Super Bowl at home fare? Tampa Bay faced the Chiefs at their Raymond James Stadium in Super Bowl LV to conclude the 2020 campaign. 
That is even more crazy when you think about how 12 NFL teams have never won even one Super Bowl. Let’s take a look at those 12 teams and see how close they’ve come to getting off this list  
1967: Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 1968: Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14 1969: New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7
