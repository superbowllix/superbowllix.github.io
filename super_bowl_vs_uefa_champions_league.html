        <p>The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to date.A  
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
The Champions League final vs. Super Bowl argument rages on between football and soccer (also known as “football”) fans. It’s the biggest game of the season in either sport, as the Super Bowl is the marquee matchup in the United States, while the Champions League final rules the parts of the world, where soccer reigns supreme. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
Both the Super Bowl and the Champions League final occur annually and both pit professional organizations against each other, rather than national teams. But yet again, the comparison ends with  
UEFA, European football’s governing body, does offer much higher prize money to Champions League winners than the NFL does for the Super Bowl. Barcelona received $108.4million in prize money when they were crowned champions of Europe in 2015, while the Patriots were handed $14.9million for winning the Super Bowl that year. 
Super Bowl vs Champions League final. Which event is bigger? TV audiences, performances, social media, stadiums. 
Super Bowl vs Champions League Parity + Luck For our purposes, we will be starting our investigation in 1997-98, as the format for both the NFL playoffs and Champions League has remained mostly  
However, there’s another annual sporting event that competes with the Champions League Final in terms of popularity and revenue: the US’s Super Bowl Sunday, which concludes the NFL season. Back in 2015, the Super Bowl brought in 114 million viewers compared to the Champions League Final’s 380 million, according to Infographics. 
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe. Both the NFL and UEFA have built their versions of football into global powerhouses, and fans have responded in droves, with viewership numbers increasing rapidly across the world. 
With the 2021 Super Bowl 55 about to take place and the 2021 Champions League also very much underway i thought i would battle the two against eachother to s 
The Super Bowl is the sports ratings king of the United States, but it seems it has to settle for second place as an annual worldwide sports spectacle. Reuters: UEFA’s Champions League final has for the first time replaced the NFL’s Super Bowl as the most-watched annual sports event, according to a survey. 
With Super Bowl Sunday approaching and the UEFA Champions League knockout stage just around the corner, it's time to make a definitive comparison of two of the most popular sporting competitions  
The Super Bowl versus the FIFA World Cup: two colossal events that captivate the globe, each with its own fervent following. In this video, we dive deep into 
Champions' League final 109m watched whole thing live at home (206m watched part) Super Bowl 106m (162m) Bahrain GP 54m (115m) Men's 100m final 33m (95m) Federer-Roddick 29m (89m) Japan-South Korea (baseball) 27m (82m) World Series game 6 26m (72m) NBA finals game 5 26m (59m) Masters final day 21m (49m) 
The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
Theo nghiên cứu của Nielsen Group, trận Super Bowl năm 2022 giữa Los Angeles Rams và Cincinnati Bengals đã được 2/3 người Mỹ theo dõi, thu hút khoảng 208 triệu người
