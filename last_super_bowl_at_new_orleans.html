        <p>Last time a Super Bowl was in New Orleans. New Orleans last hosted Super Bowl 47 between the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers which created an economic impact of $480 million for the city. 
And, for the coin toss, the winning head coaches of the previous six New Orleans Super Bowls were featured. New Orleans had cemented itself as a staple of the Super Bowl. Super Bowl XXXVI: February 3, 2002. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the NFL postponed a week of regular season games. As a result, the rest of the season—Super  
The city hosted the Super Bowl four times in the 1970s, twice in the 1980s and twice in the 1990s. New Orleans also hosted the Super Bowl in 2002, which culminated with a 20-17 upset victory by  
Super Bowl LIX will take place next month in the Superdome. The venue has hosted many NFL championships, as New Orleans has been a great backdrop. Which games have taken place in New Orleans and what other venue hosted the Super Bowl? Let’s take a look  
Jan. 11, 1970, Tulane Stadium: Kansas City 23, Minnesota 7. 1. New Orleans was supposed to get Super Bowl III, in which the New York Jets upset the Baltimore Colts, in part as a thank you to two  
New Orleans hosted its first Super Bowl on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in front of a crowd of nearly 81,000. Led by Head Coach Hank Stram, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in the last-ever championship between the NFL and AFL before the two leagues merged. 
But just moments after Jacoby Jones had lit up Super Bowl 47, the lights went out. And those 34 extraordinary minutes of darkness are largely what the last Super Bowl held in New Orleans on 3  
The last Super Bowl played in New Orleans has gone down as the ‘Blackout Bowl’, due to a 34-minute power outage in the Superdome shortly after Beyonce’s half-time show. Sandwiching the powercut was another hugely entertaining game as brothers John and Jim Harbaugh faced off as the Ravens and 49ers head coaches. 
It was also the first time both teams started with a 13-game winning streak. This game would also mark the last Super Bowl appearance for both the Colts and Saints as of the upcoming 2024 NFL season. New Orleans was behind 10–6 at halftime of Super Bowl XLIV.

This year, the Super Bowl is in New Orleans, a place where the Super Bowl has been held ten times before, most recently in 2013.  “Last year's Super Bowl in Vegas stood out not only for its  
With Super Bowl XLVII, New Orleans ties Miami for the most prolific Super Bowl Host City, at 10 each. The Louisiana Superdome – now Mercedes-Benz Superdome – is the clear winner of host stadiums at seven games. Tulane Stadium, where the first three local Super Bowls were played, is tied for third place. 
New Orleans will be hosting its 11th Super Bowl, tied with Miami for the most Super Bowl hosting appearances. The city hosted the Super Bowl four times in the 1970s, twice in the 1980s and twice  
New Orleans is a town of resiliency, and while it still remembers last month's attack, it is ready for the NFL's biggest game of the year. 
Jay Cicero, Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation president and Super Bowl LIX Host Committee member, pointed to a UNO study that found the 2013 Super Bowl had a $480 million economic impact on the city. A projection for this year’s game hasn’t yet been calculated, but Cicero said local nonprofits are already seeing benefits. 
A sports reporter died Wednesday while in New Orleans to cover Super Bowl 59, according to the Kansas City TV station he worked for. Telemundo Kansas City (KGKC) said Thursday that 27-year-old  
"The last Super Bowl in New Orleans (in 2013) was the previous record until Taylor Swift came along," Sherman said. The average room rate in New Orleans for Swift's three-day visit was $435 a

The last Super Bowl played in New Orleans was Super Bowl 47, with a matchup of the Baltimore Ravens against the San Francisco 49ers. That game was known going in as the “Harbaugh Bowl,” as brothers John (Baltimore) and Jim (San Francisco) were the head coaches squaring off in the game. </p>
