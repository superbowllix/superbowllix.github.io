        <p>In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers.

That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
The audience for Super Bowl LVIII was so large that it approached the all-time most watched television broadcast in the United States set in 1969, when an estimated 125 to 150 million viewers

On top of the Super Bowl debut of Tom Brady (as a broadcaster, of course), the prior two games set viewership records. Last year’s game between the Chiefs and 49ers set an all-time high of 123.7 million viewers on CBS, according to Nielsen, up 7% over the previous year, which averaged a then-record 115.1 million on Fox. 
As a result, CBS's live telecast of Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024, holds the record for the largest average viewership of any live network U.S. television broadcast, with 123.7 million viewers.

Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). 
Here is the list of the top 10 most-watched Super Bowl halftime shows based on reported viewership in the United States. The list was compiled using historical data from The Washington Post and The Independent . </p>
