        <p>A look at where every Super Bowl MVP went to college and which college has the most MVP's.  USC - 3 (one each for Lynn Swann, Marcus Allen and Malcolm Smith) Texas Tech - 3 (all for Patrick  
Some surprising schools on the list are represented by the 58 Super Bowl MVP winners. Whether you view that in the negative or positive light, it can be eye-opening. Perhaps that is due to the recency bias of Michigan being at the top. Some national powers on this list don't have a Super Bowl MVP that might surprise you such as Auburn, LSU, or  
Players who have won multiple Super Bowl MVP awards will be counted for each. ACC (6) Florida State (2) Fred Biletnikoff, WR, Oakland Raiders (Super Bowl XI) Dexter Jackson, S, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Super Bowl XXXVII) Louisville (1) Deion Branch, WR, New England Patriots (Super Bowl XXXIX) Miami (2) Ottis Anderson, RB, New York Giants (Super

But have you ever considered how close Kent State – which didn’t win its first bowl game until 2019 — came to having two Super Bowl MVPs?

Malcolm Smith gave USC another Super Bowl MVP when he took home the hardware for Super Bowl XLVIII in February of 2014 against the Denver Broncos. 
Smith attended William Howard Taft High School, where he was a letterman in football and track. [2] In football, he was named to the Student Sports Sophomore All-American and Cal-Hi Sports All-State first-team as a 2004 sophomore when he had 800-plus yards of total offense and 8 touchdowns, plus 2 interceptions, as Taft won the L.A.

Hello! Great to see another football fan here! No one college can claim to have produced the most Super Bowl MVPs, as the honors are widely spread across many schools. However, a few universities do stand out. The University of Alabama, Purdue University, and University of Southern California (USC) each have produced three Super Bowl MVPs. 
Mahomes enters Super Bowl 59 tied with Joe Montana for the second-most Super Bowl MVPs at three apiece. The only other players to win the award multiple times are Terry Bradshaw (2), Eli Manning  
Super Bowl LVIII is set as Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers will take on Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs for the right to hoist the Lombardi Trophy. Through the first 57 Super Bowls 48 different players have been named the game’s Most Valuable Player and next Sunday somebody will add (or re-add) their name to that list.
