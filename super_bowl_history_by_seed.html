        <p>The #2 seed has also done well in the Super Bowl, with the AFC's #2 seed winning six Super Bowls since 1975, and the NFC's #2 seed winning four Super Bowls. Funnily enough, the #4 seed has managed to win the Super Bowl seven times since 1975, with AFC teams accounting for four of these wins. #3, #5 and #6 seeds have all won the Super Bowl twice

The last time the Eagles were the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, after the 2017 season, they advanced to Super Bowl 52. There they beat the AFC No. 1-seeded Patriots 41-33.

The Cowboys and Bills met in the Super Bowl for the second year in a row, but this time, both entered as the No. 1 seed. The Georgia Dome in Atlanta was the host site of the Super Bowl for the 1993 season, and Dallas got the better of Buffalo once again, winning 30-13. 
The history of the No. 1 seed, by the numbers. Since 1990 playoffs, when postseason expanded to 12 teams/6 per conference.  14 of the last 31 Super Bowl champions were No. 1 seeds (45.1%) 
The Rams lost Super Bowl XIV 31-19 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1979 as the No. 3 seed. On the other side of the ball we have a No. 1 seed. Since 1990, including the Niners, 33 top-seeded teams  
About three-quarters (32 of 42) of teams that made the Super Bowl got a bye (first or second seed) from 1999 to 2019 made the Super Bowl. This included 52% of teams that were the one seed and 24%  
The 2005 Steelers were the first team to win a Super Bowl as a No. 6 seed.  England advanced to Super Bowl XXXVI and beat "The Greatest Show on Turf" in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. 
The two Super Bowl titles the Chiefs have won in recent years have come as the No. 1 and 2 seeds. Can they do it as a No. 3 seed? Our research shows that the odds are against third seeds to win a Super Bowl. The Colts remain the only No. 3 seed to win a Super Bowl in the last 30 years, and that was in 2006. 
The Eagles have reached the Super Bowl five times in franchise history and are 1-3 in the NFL’s biggest game. Their first Super Bowl appearance was in Super Bowl XV when they lost 27-10 to the Raiders. They reached the Super Bowl again during the 2004 season when they lost 24-21 to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX. 
What quarterback has the most Super Bowl titles? Tom Brady’s seven Super Bowl titles are the most of any quarterback and player in NFL history. NFL Playoffs results from the last 10 years. 2024. Super Bowl LVIII: Chiefs (25) vs. 49ers (22) NFC Championship: 49ers (34) vs. Lions (31) AFC Championship: Chiefs (17) vs. Ravens (10) 2023 
The odds of Super Bowl LII featuring the top seed from each conference are a long shot. Since 1975 when the NFL’s playoff format began basing home field advantage on teams’ regular season winning percentages, Super Bowl LII (2017 season) will mark just the thirteenth time the game will showcase the conference’s top seeds. 
Pick: 1-seed Lions reach the first Super Bowl in franchise history by corralling Saquon Barkley and the 2-seed Eagles. Super Bowl 2025 prediction Pick: The Lions' ride ends without a trophy Feb. 9  
Super Bowl XXXIII was played in Miami in 1999, with Denver winning its second consecutive Championship under quarterback John Elway (game MVP) by defeating the Atlanta Falcons 34-19. The Denver Broncos smothered the Falcons with a strong defensive effort led by Trevor Price and Ray Crockett to hand former Bronco head coach Dan Reeves the loss. 
And the history shows it with just two 6 seeds (2005 Steelers and 2010 Packers) winning the Super Bowl out of the 12 seed format. Making it to the big game as an underdog is achievement enough, much less winning it. But before we look closer at those cases, let‘s examine why low seeds have trouble in more detail when it comes to the NFL playoffs: 
The No. 1 seed in the AFC now heads to New Orleans for a Super Bowl rematch against the Philadelphia Eagles,  take a look back at the Chiefs’ Super Bowl history. Super Bowl LVIII, 2024. 
That peculiar seed matchup marked the first Super Bowl in the modern seeding era where neither a No. 1 nor a No. 2 seed was in the game. Of course, it was a short-lived trend in that the 2023 matchup pitted No. 1 seeds against one another.
