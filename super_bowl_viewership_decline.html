        <p>The last two Super Bowl's have set audience records, averaging 123.7 million viewers last year.  The game averaged 25.4 million viewers, a -13% decline from last year’s Monday night game. The  
The Super Bowl isn't the event it once was. 
[142] [143] In 1980, Nielsen found that Super Bowl XV was watched by approximately 3.1 million viewers—a decline of over one million compared to the previous year—though it was the most watched broadcast of the week. [144] 
The 9 percent decline in television viewership from last year’s Super Bowl is roughly in line with season-long trends.  According to CBS the Super Bowl averaged 5.7 million viewers streaming  
Super Bowl 55 (Chiefs-49ers) — the final Super Bowl before Nielsen began including out-of-home — averaged an in-home audience of 100.45 million on FOX and (per Adweek) an out-of-home audience of 11 million. The sharp decline of in-home viewership tracks with the trend in household ratings (which by definition do not include out-of-home  
The 2022 Super Bowl had a 22 percent OOH viewership, or 9 percentage points more than the regular season.  With the ongoing decline of U.S. cable/satellite households — now down to about 65  
Across all of CBS’s platforms, Super Bowl LV averaged a total audience of 96.4 million viewers — the least-watched final game since Super Bowl 41 on CBS in 2007 (The Colts-Bears drew 93.18  
The number of Americans who watched the Super Bowl on TV last year fell 13% from the peak in 2015, but the average cost of a 30-second advertising spot has just kept climbing.This year, the retail  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Nielsen also reported 202.4 million viewers had tuned in to some portion (a minimum of six minutes) of Super Bowl LVIII, a year-over-year increase of 10% (184 million). 
The Wild Card Round saw a 6% decline,  while Super Bowl viewership was higher in 2023 than 2022 Divisional and Wild Card Round viewership was down slightly in 2023 as compared to 2022. 
Last year's record audience of 123.4 million viewers watched the Chiefs top San Francisco 49ers in a narrow 25-22 victory in only the second Super Bowl overtime game in history. 
While the decline in viewership could be partially attributed to the rise of streaming, as 5.7 million people streamed the Super Bowl in 2021, the streaming audience is not large enough to fully explain the dwindling interest. The consistent trend could be attributed to the overall decline of live event viewership. 
Interest wanes in the Super Bowl this season. From all reports, viewers can expect to see Swift at Super Bowl 59 this year, too, but maybe the novelty of her relationship with Kelce is wearing off  
Last year’s record audience of 123.4 million viewers watched the Chiefs top San Francisco 49ers in a narrow 25-22 victory in only the second Super Bowl overtime game in history. 
According to iSpot.tv, whose metrics differ from Nielsen’s, the Super Bowl averaged 121 million viewers, and 149.9 million watched all or some of the broadcast across NBC, Telemundo and Peacock. 
The last time these two teams matched up in the Super Bowl, their ratings finished as the third most watched version of the game ever when it came to the main broadcast, with a viewership of around 114.21 million. 
Even the National Football League appears to have seen effects of the decline of football. The Super Bowl lost more than 12.5 million viewers from 2011 to 2019, dropping to its lowest viewership  
Fox Sports' lineup of media talent appear ahead of Super Bowl LIX Samuel Jane . Fox Sports is banking on the “Chiefs fatigue” narrative being “overplayed and overblown”, according to two high-level Fox executives. This is the second time in three seasons that Fox has aired a Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl. 
Viewership was 96.4 million people between CBS’ television broadcast and streaming services for Super Bowl LV, a 5.5% decline from the amount who watched Super Bowl LIV. </p>
