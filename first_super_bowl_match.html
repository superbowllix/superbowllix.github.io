The first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (known retroactively as Super Bowl I and referred to in contemporaneous reports, including the game's radio broadcast, as the Super Bowl) [5] was an American football game played on January 15, 1967, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. 
Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker in official marketing; the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were retroactively applied to the first two games. [4] A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. [5]

In Super Bowl LI, the first Super Bowl to end in overtime, [112] the Atlanta Falcons led 28–3 late in the third quarter, but the Patriots came back to tie the game 28–28 with back-to-back touchdowns and two-point conversions, and the Patriots went on to win 34–28 in overtime. [113] 
The Packers won Super Bowl 1 and Super Bowl 2, but the AFL soon got its revenge in Super Bowl 3. New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed a victory over the Baltimore Colts and ultimately delivered with a 16-7 win, giving the AFL its first Super Bowl win. The Chiefs, losers of Super Bowl 1, won their first Super Bowl trophy in Super Bowl 4. 
Which team won the first Super Bowl?  It was the only Super Bowl game in history that failed to sell out, with tickets around $10 to $15 that were thought to be overpriced, and a matchup that  
The Super Bowl’s halftime entertainment has been a major attraction of the championship game since the first Super Bowl in 1967. Originally featuring marching bands, military drill teams, and even astronauts, it has since changed with the decades. 
Super Bowl LI (New England Patriots 34, Atlanta Falcons 28, Feb. 5, 2017): In this epic game, the Patriots overcame a 25-point deficit to win in the Super Bowl's first overtime game. Super Bowl MVPs

The kick returns have played a key role for both Philadelphia and Kansas City on the way to the Super Bowl. The Eagles’ coverage units have generated two takeaways, forcing a fumble on the opening kick of a wild-card win against Green Bay and again in the NFC title game against Washington. 
1. Chiefs Over/Under 2.5 field goals. You have to go all the way back to the Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl in February 2023 to find the last time Harrison Butker missed a field goal in the playoffs. He  
Super Bowl 59 will be the first held in the city since 2013, when a power outage delayed the game for 34 minutes – the first and only time the nation's biggest sporting event has been delayed by  
On January 15, 1967, the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) smash the American Football League (AFL)’s Kansas City Chiefs, 35‑10, in the first‑ever AFL‑NFL World  
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Last season’s Super Bowl featured just about everything. There were trick plays, clutch performances and plenty of high drama as Kansas City rallied for a 25-22 overtime win against San Francisco. The one thing missing — a single kickoff return. All 13 kickoffs went for touchbacks, marking the first Super Bowl [] 
Tickets to this year's Super Bowl will set you back a few thousand dollars — but the first game in 1967 didn't even sell out. The Kansas City Chiefs played in the very first Super Bowl in 1967.
