A hymn written in the late 19th century that offers a prayer for faith and freedom has become popularly known as the Black national anthem. “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” with its evocations of the promised land, has a powerful message that resonates still. 
The “Black National Anthem” is set to be performed at the Super Bowl 2025 alongside the official national anthem of the United States. But many NFL fans are not happy about it and remarked that it’s rather “divisive”. 
Others say they find the song divisive.
