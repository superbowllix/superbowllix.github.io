The 2024 Super Bowl pales in comparison, despite reaching new viewing records both domestically and internationally. According to Nielsen, Super Bowl LVIII drew an average audience of 123.7 million viewers in the U.S. plus a total international audience of 62.5 million. 
The 2023 Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles set a domestic viewership record with 115.1 million viewers across Fox, Fox Deportes and other digital streams.

For comparison, the 2022 Super Bowl pulled in nearly 100 million viewers. When the Los Angeles Rams topped the Cincinnati Bengals, 99.18 million people were watching per Statista . 
While the NFL ranks fourth among soccer fans, it’s particularly noteworthy that it holds the top position among the general population. This contrast, combined with soccer fans’ higher overall NFL viewership rate (41% vs. 38%), reveals an audience that consumes a broader spectrum of sports content than the average American.

What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup?

However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
What Has More Viewers: Super Bowl or Champions League Final? Champions League final vs. Super Bowl viewership reaches into the hundreds of millions, easily, for both games!
