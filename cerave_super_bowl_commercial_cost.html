        <p>The average Super Bowl commercial is only 30 seconds in length, but can be longer if companies are willing to pay the extra money for it.  Here's what 30-second Super Bowl ads have cost through  
These events led to the epic conclusion of the Michael CeraVe marketing campaign – a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl (and an extended version as well). The ad featuring Cera was satirical, over-the-top and dramatic, ending with the reveal that Micheal Cera is pitching his ad idea to a team of dermatologists. 
Around 123 million viewers tuned in to watch the Chiefs take on the 49ers and the average cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad is $7 million. In contrast, Liquid Death claims 200 million people will be exposed to the winning brand's message on half a million cases. That's a CPM of $1.77 compared to Super Bowl's average CPM of $56.91. 
The cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad has grown to between $6  and CeraVe push for brand awareness  e.l.f.’s Super Bowl commercial amassed 57 billion impressions and drove 10 times the  
For comparison, the average cost of an everyday television ad is estimated to be just under $105,000, though this can vary depending on time slot, ad length, and broadcast area. While the cost of a 2024 Super Bowl ad matches 2023's average pricing, the cost has been steadily increasing over the years, rising from 2019's average price of $4.5  
The ad ended with CeraVe emphasizing it's made with oversight from dermatologists, not Michael Cera. Online, people deemed the ad the " best Super Bowl commercial in years." 
This all built up to a 30-second ad spot for CeraVe in last Sunday’s Super Bowl. The ad reportedly cost the brand $7 million. Research dive: Glossy+ Research analyzed available Google Trends data for the week surrounding the Super Bowl to see the impact this ad had on search interest. 
The cost for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial has hit new heights, with ads being sold for about $8 million in the weeks leading up to the game, according to multiple reports. While Fox sold out its Super Bowl commercial inventory months in advance, broadcasters hold additional ad spots for unexpected delays in the game.

So for Super Bowl 58, skincare brand CeraVe found its perfect partner: the aptly-named actor, Michael Cera. Known for his stilted comedy style from roles in ‘Superbad’, ‘Scott Pilgrim vs. the World’ and ‘Barbie’, the Canadian star’s chemistry with the brand goes beyond their nominative similarity. 
When he pitched the idea of working on a commercial to Norell, Norell didn’t realize Doritos had revived its “Crash the Super Bowl” contest after a nine-year hiatus, he said.The competition  
Again, this just goes to show two unique approaches to handling digital support for a Super Bowl ad. Nerds spent most of their budget one week before the game; CeraVe spent most of its budget the day after the game; CeraVe had a much larger annual budget, and dedicated just 6% of it to support their Super Bowl ad campaign
