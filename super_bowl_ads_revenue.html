By comparison, CBS’s Super Bowl LV in 2021 brought in the most pre-game ad revenue since 2017, $77.6 million, as compared to Super Bowl LVI, which brought in $51.1 million for pre-game advertising in 2022. The average cost of a 2022 Super Bowl LVI 30-second commercial was $6.5 million, up more than $2 million over 2016 rates. 
In 2023, the last time Fox had the Super Bowl, the company pulled in nearly $600M in Super Bowl advertising revenue with spots averaging $6.5M per unit. Paramount surpassed that total revenue number last year. Fox has not yet announced its overall ad revenue for this year’s game.

Fox has sold out of ad spots for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9, with more than 10 commercials selling for a record $8 million, according to a person familiar. 
Just from national ad sales, the company is approaching $700 million in revenue, a new record for the Big Game. Two years ago, for Super Bowl 57, Fox reached around $600 million in sales.

What a Super Bowl commercial costs in any given year is just as much a part of the overall buzz as the ads themselves. As expected, the prices for a 30-second spot have skyrocketed since the first big game kicked off back in the 1960s, with a commercial in Super Bowl I running just over $37,000.
