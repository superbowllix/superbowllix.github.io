        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
T here have been 820 quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era — 34 have won a Super Bowl; and 13 have won more than one Super Bowl. If Patrick Mahomes wins next Sunday, he will join Troy Aikman (3), Terry Bradshaw (4), Joe Montana (4), and Tom Brady (7) as the only quarterbacks to win three or more Super Bowls. 
Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker in official marketing; the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were retroactively applied to the first two games. [4] A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. [5] 
Despite being injured and Earl Morrall helping the Dolphins reach the Super Bowl, Griese led the Dolphins to a 14-7 victory over Washington and became the first and only undefeated team to win the

The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom Brady leads the pack with seven titles, three clear of any other quarterback, while  
Bradshaw threw for 300-plus yards in half his Super Bowls which, in the 1970s, was the quarterback equivalent of going to the moon (Super Bowl XII, in 1978, featured 217 total net passing yards).

The Modern Era . This era saw the completion of the Patriots' dynasty, which saw the team play in nine Super Bowls over a 20-year run. It also marked the rise of the Kansas City Chiefs, led by  
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles  
Quarterback picks The draft is a crapshoot. Players can surprise while those that are expected to be great disappoint. The quarterback position is a great example. 
-Len Dawson lost the first Super Bowl ever, and then won the fourth Super Bowl with the Chiefs. It should be noted that Dawson had already won an AFL championship in 1962 prior to the invention of the Super Bowl. -Bob Griese lost his first Super Bowl start, and then won two in a row with the Miami Dolphins. 
Patrick Mahomes' first five seasons as a starter compare favorably with the first five seasons of any quarterback to ever play.No one other than Dan Marino is even close in the modern era, making

I created a similar thread regarding this topic earlier, but I unfortunately left out the phrasing "Last 16 Quarterbacks", so people got furious about it since John Elway, Len Dawson, Jim Kelly, Bob Griese, Craig Morton, and Fran Tarkenton have made it back to the Super Bowl after losing their debut Super Bowl appearance, but I wasn't referring to those guys as that was over 2 decades ago, and  
Ben Roethlisberger won two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 and 2009, becoming one of the youngest quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl in his first victory. “Big Ben” was known  
The San Francisco 49ers will try to win a sixth Super Bowl in franchise history on Sunday in Las Vegas.  The franchise has a record of 5-2 all time in championship games, but enters the weekend  
Led by quarterback Fran Tarkenton and defensive end Alan Page, the Vikings won a whopping 69.4% of their regular-season games during the decade. 40. Super Bowl IX was supposed to be the first  
Aikman’s first Super Bowl was his best, a four-touchdown performance that ruined Buffalo’s hopes of snapping a two-game title game losing streak. He was worse in 1994 and still beat the Bills  </p>
