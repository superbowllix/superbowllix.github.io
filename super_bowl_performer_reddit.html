        <h2><strong>super bowl performer reddit super bowl las vegas when</strong></h2>
        <p>In a few years, I can see Doja Cat crushing the Super Bowl. She's already a good live performer, just needs more time to build her catalog. I know they offered Adele the position a few years ago and that would be a fascinating show to see at the Super Bowl. 
We have different definitions of irrelevant I think. Most Super Bowl performers are legacy artists because you need an entire career‚Äôs worth of hits to pull it off. Someone like P!nk may not be ‚Äútrendy‚Äù but irrelevant seems like a stretch. I thought we were talking about like Bebe Rexha tier people. 
Super Bowl officials informed Prince that it would be pouring buckets during his performance. When they asked if there was anything they could do, he replied: "Make it rain harder." Epic. Badass. Attitude. 
The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show starring Michael Jackson is the most watched Super Bowl halftime show, with a TV audience of more than 133.4 million viewers. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] The Super Bowl LVI halftime show starring Dr. Dre , Snoop Dog , Eminem , Mary J. Blige , Kendrick Lamar and 50 cent is the most viewed Super Bowl halftime show on YouTube  
Here is the complete list of previous Super Bowl halftime performers and themes: 2025: Kendrick Lamar with special guest SZA 2024: Usher with special guests Alicia Keys, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R  
This year's Super Bowl halftime performer is award-winning hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar. Lamar has performed at a previous Super Bowl as he was a co-headliner with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50  
The Super Bowl officially has its next halftime show performer.. Kendrick Lamar, 37, has been revealed as the headliner for the Super Bowl LIX halftime show, scheduled for Feb. 9, 2025.On Sunday  
The Super Bowl has an extended halftime of 25-30 minutes due to the halftime show. The halftime show runs 12‚Äì15 minutes and will air on Fox. Super Bowl 2025 Halftime Show Guest Performers 
The pregame lineup for Super Bowl LIX is in and it's leaning heavily into Louisiana pride.. Grammy-winning singer and composer Jon Batiste will sing the national anthem while Trombone Shorty and  
TN: How valuable is a Super Bowl halftime performance for older artists, like Usher, Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre? SL: When you think about why those artists do the Super Bowl, like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Mary J. Blige in 2022, they didn‚Äôt necessarily have a huge hit at the time. But they are hip-hop pioneers, and they go out there [on stage  
Her performance was great and rated one of the highest ever. She didn't give a typical pop girl performance was sparkles and lgbt flags like gaga, Katy and the like. It was very avant-garde and full of great visuals. There's a reason it has so many YouTube views 3 months after the performance.

Unpopular opinion but I don‚Äôt think Taylor would be that great of a super bowl performer. She can clearly sell out stadiums and she has some good hits but I don‚Äôt think she can COMMAND a stadium in a way that a super bowl performance would require, at least not on her own. I‚Äôve never viewed Taylor as a performer.

Like is anybody else still emotional over this? I've been a fan since I heard Just Dance as a 7th Grader, and it just feels like her career has come full circle in its' progression going from The Fame - The Fame Monster, Born This Way, downward progression to ARTPOP then back up with Cheek to Cheek and Back up with Joanne, which regardless of success on the singles charts, has certainly done  
This is rather ironic because playing the Super Bowl Halftime show is considered one of the pinnacles of a pop star‚Äôs career. This was Justin‚Äôs third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). 
I feel like everyone‚Äôs Super Bowl performance is a celebration of their careers up to that point, basically reminiscing on their biggest hits, and she would have SUCH a collection to choose from. I‚Äôm not really a Rihanna fan but the whole thing was so nostalgic and positive, I loved it, and I feel like it could be so fun for Taylor too if  
Consider this, companies that want to advertise during the super bowl pay millions for just 30 seconds Performers are companies as well with a product to sell, they get a entire showcase on the field for free. That is a huge value to them. 
Todd in the Shadow's dedicated subreddit! Watch Todd's One Hit Wonderland, where he takes a look at the full careers of bands and artists known for only one song, or watch Todd's Pop Song Reviews, where he takes one current smash hit song and take it apart, break it down line by line, see what parts work and what doesn't, and analyze where it fits within both current trends and the artists  
edit: actually! glancing at some other Super Bowl setlists - maybe Beyonce's End of Time? I don't think it even charted in the US but I remember that Roseland performance made the rounds and it was an understood standout of 4 that she clearly loved too. </p>
