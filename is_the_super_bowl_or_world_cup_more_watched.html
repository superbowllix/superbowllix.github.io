        <h2><strong>is the super bowl or world cup more watched super bowl party food favorites</strong></h2>
        <p>The massive viewership numbers of the World Cup and Super Bowl pad the coffers of FIFA and the NFL respectively. FIFA has turned a profit of nearly $5 billion or more from the last three World Cups. 
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It‚Äôs hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
What is watched more, the Super Bowl or the World Cup? The Super Bowl LVIII had 62.5 million television viewers, as reported by the NFL, making it one of the most-watched single-day sporting events in the world. 
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion.

According to Roadtrips.com five billion people watch the World Cup Final, while the Super Bowl is actually the 8th most-watched event with 115 million views. Finishing above NFL's showpiece are the Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, Women's World Cup, Olympic Games, Winter Games and the Champions League Final. 
In 2023, the Super Bowl LVII raked in 115.1 million viewers on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming networks, which helped the event earn its place in history as the most-watched Super Bowl of all time. One of the most interesting facets about Super Bowl viewership is that not all viewers are sports enthusiasts. 
Two of the most watched sporting events in the world are the World Cup and the Super Bowl. Drawing in hordes of rabid fans with every game, each has a fan base that reaches into the millions. In fact, the two are such big sporting draws that comparisons are often drawn between them, with neither side having much luck convincing the other of the
