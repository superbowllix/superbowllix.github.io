He threw more TDs than INTs, but his career was, at

Tampa Bay Buccaners quarterback Brad Johnson (C) pitches the ball during Super Bowl XXXVII against the Oakland Raiders at Qualcomm Stadium 26 January, 2003 in San Diego, California. 
The D also scored 21 of the team’s 48 points in the Super Bowl win over the Oakland Raiders.

A "worst quarterbacks NFL Super Bowl" reel might not define Super Bowl LVII. Let’s look at the 10 worst quarterbacks Super Bowl games created. NBA. Eastern. Atlantic; Celtics. Nets. Knicks.

Nick Foles etched his name in NFL history with his unfathomable run to Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl victory.
