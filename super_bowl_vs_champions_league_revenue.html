        <p>Super Bowl vs. Champions League Final Estimated Betting Volume. The 2024 Champions League final vs. Super Bowl 58 estimated betting value is tough to nail down. However, let’s just say there was a lot of money wagered on both events! For Super Bowl 58, there was a record $186.5 million wagered, just at Nevada sportsbooks alone! Ben Fawkes  
But if we compare that with the NFL and their biggest game, the Super Bowl, EPL fans may feel a little disappointed. The 2021 Super Bowl had an average viewership of 91.6 million in the US alone, with another estimated 30 to 50 million globally. This is significantly more than the biggest match in the EPL last year. 
The Super Bowl generates enormous economic activity in the United States, boosting tourism, advertising, and consumer spending. The halftime show has become an event in itself, featuring performances by world-renowned artists. The Champions League final also generates substantial economic impact in Europe and globally. 
The NFL generated over $20 billion in revenue last season, surpassing other major sports leagues by a landslide. The Super Bowl alone drew a record-breaking 123 million viewers, while the season saw a surge in media and sports betting revenue. As a result, each team is taking home more than $400 million in media and sponsorship revenue from the  
The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to date. 
The Bowl is the final game of the NFL season and is held in February. The 2021 Super Bowl won by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a viewership of 110 million viewers while the 2021 UEFA Champions League final won by Chelsea had a viewership of 700 million viewers. The numbers are obvious, the UEFA Champions League is bigger than the Super Bowl. 
The Champions League final is undoubtedly the biggest annual event on the football calender. Glory, millions of dollars and a place in history beckon, all played out in front of fans spread across  
The Champions League final, on the other hand, reserves most of its advertising slots for sponsors who committed to the entire 32-team tournament from the outset, meaning the final itself adds little to the revenue pot by comparison to the Super Bowl. 
However, there’s another annual sporting event that competes with the Champions League Final in terms of popularity and revenue: the US’s Super Bowl Sunday, which concludes the NFL season. Back in 2015, the Super Bowl brought in 114 million viewers compared to the Champions League Final’s 380 million, according to Infographics. 
For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. Aside from Tom Brady's Patriots, there's been a plethora of different winners in the past 20 years, and franchises can be successful one year, and terrible the next one. 
With the 2021 Super Bowl 55 about to take place and the 2021 Champions League also very much underway i thought i would battle the two against eachother to s 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
Both the Super Bowl and the Champions League final occur annually and both pit professional organizations against each other, rather than national teams. But yet again, the comparison ends with  
By means of a thorough examination of these five main pinnacle events—the Super Bowl, UEFA Champions League Final, FIFA World Cup Final, NBA Finals, and World Series—we have amply demonstrated how these events are not only the height of sports competition but also intricate products of the interaction of culture, economy, politics, and  
He argues the Champions League final should feel more like the Super Bowl, although it should be pointed out that the Champions League’s global audience dwarfs the NFL showpiece event. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
Is The Super Bowl Losing Popularity? The Super Bowl is undoubtedly the most watched broadcast in the US year after year. According to the NFL, the highest Super Bowl viewership in NFL history was Super Bowl LVII in 2023, with 115 million views. The last time the NFL saw numbers like that was Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 with 114 million viewers. 
When it comes down to the international TV audience, revenue generated per game and even the pay that winning players receive, the World Cup vs Super Bowl debate has a clear winner. The World Cup  
The 2018 FIFA World Cup final polled a viewership of 1.12 billion viewers while the highest grossing NFL Super Bowl grossed 114 million viewers, more than ten times its size. The 2021 Super Bowl had a revenue of $545m while 2018 FIFA World Cup had a revenue of $5.36 billion. 
How much revenue does the UEFA Champions League generate? In 2022/23, the competition's total revenue amounted to over 3.2 billion euros. </p>
