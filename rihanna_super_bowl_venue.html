Super Bowl Halftime producer Bruce Rogers of Tribe, Inc. let Rihanna and her team know the limitations of the grass field, and for the sake of a bigger and better show, suggested a performance suspended in the air.

Rihanna's performance took place during the Half-Time show of the 57th Super Bowl - which was held on 12th February 2023. The game took place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, and saw the Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles.

“I’m really excited to have Barbados on the Super Bowl stage. Rihanna previously turned down the NFL’s request to perform at the famous halftime show in 2019 , showing solidarity with Colin  
While the NFL has gotten it right for the last few years (see: Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Usher, Dr. Dre and friends, and The Weeknd), we'd like to see these artists take on the Super Bowl, even if  
More than 123.4 million viewers tuned in for Usher’s halftime show at last year’s Super Bowl, edging out Rihanna's performance in  make when they headline a venue as massive as Caesars

The Super Bowl stage is an iconic venue, but not every musician wants to perform on it. Artists including Adele and Pink have turned it down. The NFL doesn't have the best track record with choosing performers for the Super Bowl halftime show — performances by Maroon 5 or the Black Eyed Peas come to mind — but it's not for lack of trying.
