Super Bowl record history courtesy of ESPN. Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl wins The Pittsburgh Steelers have won 6 Super Bowls beginning in 1975, with their most recent coming back in 2009. 
Pittsburgh's new recruits in the early 1970s made an instant impact, and the Steelers became the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years between 1975 and 1980. The Steelers' first Super Bowl loss came in 1996, as the Dallas Cowboys got revenge for 1976 and 1979 with a 27-17 win in Arizona. 
The winner of Super Bowl XIII would make NFL history as the first team to win three Lombardi trophies, and the game itself was a rematch of Super Bowl X. Both franchises believed they were the best in the NFL, and this matchup allowed it to be settled on the field. 
Here's what NFL history shows about Super Bowl rematches.  Rematch: 1979 Super Bowl; Steelers won, 35-31; The Steelers and Cowboys had played in at least one Super Bowl before the 1976 title

Detroit Police Commissioner Ella Bully-Cummings held meetings the day after the Steelers had won the 2005 AFC Championship because she knew it was an easy drive between her city and Pittsburgh, and so she considered it a real possibility there could be as many as 100,000 extra Steelers fans coming in for the  
The Steelers then drove 70 yards for the clinching touchdown – a 1-yard run by Harris – and during the drive Bradshaw connected with Stallworth on another deep route on another third down, this one for 45 yards, and the Steelers had their fourth Super Bowl championship during a six-season span of the 1970s. 
On Jan. 21, 1979, the Pittsburgh Steelers recaptured the championship with a 35-31 win over the Dallas Cowboys to become the first team to win three Super Bowl titles. 
When the ball had landed on the Three Rivers Stadium carpet, and the back judge came running up to the pile of bodies and signaled the pass was incomplete, the Steelers were going to the Super Bowl. Four seasons into the Bill Cowher era, one year after a crushing home defeat in the AFC Championship Game, they had finally gotten over the hump. 
On Jan. 12, 1975, the Pittsburgh Steelers captured their first ever Super Bowl championship with a 16-6 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. 
On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27–23 against the Arizona Cardinals. [46] At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first). [47] 
Here's what NFL history shows about Super Bowl rematches.  Rematch: 1979 Super Bowl; Steelers won, 35-31. The Steelers and Cowboys had played in at least one Super Bowl before the 1976 title  
Their charter flight from Oakland was still in the air, but in a way the Pittsburgh Steelers already had arrived. Their journey to the first championship in franchise history had another stop left – against the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IX to be played in New Orleans – but the Steelers had arrived at the level of play that Coach Chuck Noll had vowed they would reach during his first  </p>
