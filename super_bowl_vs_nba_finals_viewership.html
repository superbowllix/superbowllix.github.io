Which Is Viewed More – the Super Bowl or the NBA Playoffs? It’s estimated that 103.4 million people worldwide watched the Philadelphia Eagles beat the New England Patriots, 41-33, in Super Bowl LII last season. The season before that saw slightly higher numbers when 111.3 viewers tuned in to Super Bowl LI.

In the context of the current state of the television industry, Super Bowl LVII beat the NBA Finals' viewership by a significant margin. The former reportedly had 113.06 million viewers tuned in. 
The NBA announced that the 2023 NBA playoffs were the most-watched in more than 5 years, with viewership peaking at 17.8 million viewers during Game 5 of the finals. Social engagement also increased during the 2023 finals, with @NBA being the most-viewed brand on X (formerly known as Twitter) during the finals.

Overall, TNT’s 2023 NBA Playoffs coverage is averaging 3.8 million viewers, up 10% vs. 2022, and tied with 2018 for the network’s most-watched playoffs since 2014. 
After the most-watched NBA Playoffs in five years, but one of the least-watched NBA Finals on record, where does the league’s postseason stand in the ratings?. The 2023 NBA Playoffs averaged a 2.7 rating and 5.12 million viewers across ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV, marking the highest average in five years (2018: 5.21M) and third-highest in a decade. 
This figure beats every other sporting event: the '24 NBA Finals averaged 12 million, the '23 UEFA Champions League final attracted 450 million viewers, and the '24 Super Bowl had 173 million (123 million in the United States). 
The 2021 NBA Finals were about as successful as a Milwaukee vs. Phoenix matchup in July could be, and grew 32% in total viewers from last year's series (when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the  
Let's pretend the NBA Finals was single elimination. 11% of Americans say basketball is their favorite sport. 7% of Americans say soccer is their favorite sport. 37% of Americans say football is their favorite sport.

The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers.

For the longest time, the NBA Finals have been up there with the Super Bowl when it comes to must-watch American sporting events.
