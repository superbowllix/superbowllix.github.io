Allen remains the only player in NFL history to have won the Heisman, a national title, NFL MVP, a Super Bowl and Super Bowl MVP. Redskins RB George Rogers

Allen became the fourth USC running back to win the Heisman while becoming the first player to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season. He is arguably the most decorated player in the history of football as he is the only player to win a national title, a Heisman, a Super Bowl, a Super Bowl MVP award and an NFL regular-season MVP award. 
Of those three, only Allen has also been named a Super Bowl MVP. Overall, four Heisman winners have earned Super Bowl MVP honors.

He is the only special teams player to win the MVP honor  
He was the first NFL player to gain more than 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards during his career.

The Heisman-related trivia question for the week is who was the last Heisman winner to win a Super Bowl and the answer, for the 13th straight year, is Charles Woodson. Woodson, while a member of the Green Bay Packers, earned his ring in 2011 at Super Bowl XLV. Lamar Jackson was the last Heisman winner [] 
One notable name on this exclusive list is Marcus Allen, who holds the unique distinction of winning the Heisman Trophy, a national college title, the NFL MVP, the Super Bowl, and Super Bowl MVP  
Allen won Super Bowl XVIII in his second season, also taking home Super Bowl MVP honors. The 1985 NFL MVP retired with 12,243 rushing yards and 123 touchdowns on 3,022 carries. He caught 587
