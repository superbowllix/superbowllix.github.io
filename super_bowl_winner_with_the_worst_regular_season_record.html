The 2011 New York Giants had the worst record in the regular season among teams to win a Super Bowl. The Giants were 9-7, which is both the worst win percentage and the most losses for any NFL championship team, before going on to beat the Patriots in Super Bowl 46.

The 2011 Giants were the only team to win the Super Bowl with 7 losses, so they are the Super Bowl champion with the worst record after 15 and 16 games, too. So the Patriots had the single worst record, either alone or tied with other teams, of any Super Bowl champion through X games, for all values of X from 1 to 11.
