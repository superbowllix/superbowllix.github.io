        <h2><strong>super bowl wins under jerry jones super bowl 2025 during mardi gras</strong></h2>
        <p>Under Jerry Jones, the Cowboys’ record is 312-252. Since he’s been the owner, the Cowboys have won three Super Bowls, in 1993, 1994, and 1996. Jones saw the most success in his first decade  
Jones attended the University of Arkansas, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. [10] He was co-captain of Arkansas' 1964 national championship football team. He was an offensive lineman for College Football Hall of Fame coach Frank Broyles and a teammate of college football and NFL coach Jimmy Johnson, whom Jones hired as his first head coach after purchasing the Cowboys. 
Another Super Bowl followed six years later before the Cowboys' dominance faded in 1982, and so started a nine-year stretch in which Dallas only reached the post-season twice. But as the 1980s came to an end, life under new owner Jerry Jones was about to begin, and under head coaches Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer, the Cowboys were crowned  
The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three titles in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super Bowl titles. The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX , LI , and LIII for three titles in five seasons.

Switzer won another Super Bowl in just his second season, making it three under Jerry Jones' ownership. The Cowboys then became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years  
In 2003 Jones successfully recruited two-time Super Bowl winner Bill Parcells to Dallas, and Parcells directed the team to three winning seasons and two playoff trips in four years. In February 2007, Jones added another successful NFL head coach in Wade Phillips, who guided the club to a pair of division titles in his first three years (2007  
Jerry Jones is an American business executive who is the owner of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys, one of the world’s most valuable sports teams. Since he acquired the franchise in 1989, Dallas has won three Super Bowls (1993, 1994, and 1996). Jones is among the league’s most influential owners and is sometimes called the ‘shadow commissioner.’

Jerry Jones’ admission of regret sheds light on answer.  But the Cowboys’ 2-3 playoff record under Garrett never included a Super Bowl win or appearance or even an NFC title game appearance. 
Three coaches have won Super Bowls with the team: Tom Landry in Super Bowl VI and XII, Jimmy Johnson in Super Bowl XXVII and XXVIII, and Barry Switzer in Super Bowl XXX. [2] Landry is the team's all-time leader in games coached and wins, and Switzer leads all coaches in regular season winning percentage with .625. 
Back in 2010 Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones let Wade Phillips go and Jason Garrett took over as the interim head coach. The Cowboys closed out 2010 with a 5-3 record and 2011 was slated to be  
It’s hard to forget that the Cowboys have Super Bowl wins, considering the dry spell the team has been under for over 2 decades bow. But, Jerry Jones did in fact oversee the team for 3 of them. The Cowboys won the Lombardi Trophy under Jones’ ownership during Super Bowl XXVII in 1992, XXVIII in 1993, and XXX in 1995. 
Jerry Jones said the Cowboys could not spell Super Bowl until they acquired Haley in a trade from San Francisco. He immediately paid dividends with the Cowboys, winning back-to-back Super Bowls in

Jerry Jr. is the most one like me. You can tell that because I want to grab him by the throat every other day. He's my namesake. He's my baby. He's a pit bull. The third apple did fall the closest to the tree. And why I get so frustrated is he's creating new ways to out Jerry Jones Jerry Jones. Thank you, Jerry. (Applause.) My wife, Gene.
