        <p>The #2 seed has also done well in the Super Bowl, with the AFC's #2 seed winning six Super Bowls since 1975, and the NFC's #2 seed winning four Super Bowls. Funnily enough, the #4 seed has managed to win the Super Bowl seven times since 1975, with AFC teams accounting for four of these wins. #3, #5 and #6 seeds have all won the Super Bowl twice

Montana was named Super Bowl MVP, setting five Super Bowl records in the win while also becoming the third player to win the Super MVP and AP MVP in the same season. Super Bowl 26: Redskins vs Bills The NFL expanded the playoffs to 12 teams in 1990, and Washington and the Bills were the first teams to both make the Super Bowl as the No. 1 seed  
14 of the last 31 Super Bowl champions were No. 1 seeds (45.1%) Tennessee is among four franchises to suffer Divisional round losses twice as a No. 1 seed in this time (Kansas City, Denver and  
The Rams lost Super Bowl XIV 31-19 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1979 as the No. 3 seed. On the other side of the ball we have a No. 1 seed. Since 1990, including the Niners, 33 top-seeded teams  
About three-quarters (32 of 42) of teams that made the Super Bowl got a bye (first or second seed) from 1999 to 2019 made the Super Bowl. This included 52% of teams that were the one seed and 24%  
The odds of Super Bowl LII featuring the top seed from each conference are a long shot. Since 1975 when the NFL’s playoff format began basing home field advantage on teams’ regular season winning percentages, Super Bowl LII (2017 season) will mark just the thirteenth time the game will showcase the conference’s top seeds. 
The two Super Bowl titles the Chiefs have won in recent years have come as the No. 1 and 2 seeds. Can they do it as a No. 3 seed? Our research shows that the odds are against third seeds to win a Super Bowl. The Colts remain the only No. 3 seed to win a Super Bowl in the last 30 years, and that was in 2006. 
Super Bowl 2025 prediction. Pick: The Lions' ride ends without a trophy Feb. 9 in New Orleans. Lamar Jackson tears through the defense to give the Baltimore Ravens their first Super Bowl victory since the 2012 season in Super Bowl 47, extending Detroit's wait for at least one more year and Super Bowl 60 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. 
Super Bowl History For Spread And Totals Betting. Historical data shows that Super Bowl winners almost always cover the spread. A comprehensive look at past winners reveals this trend to be a constant, as the eventual winner has covered the spread in nine of the last 10 games, and 17 of the past 20. 
And the history shows it with just two 6 seeds (2005 Steelers and 2010 Packers) winning the Super Bowl out of the 12 seed format. Making it to the big game as an underdog is achievement enough, much less winning it. But before we look closer at those cases, let‘s examine why low seeds have trouble in more detail when it comes to the NFL playoffs: 
What quarterback has the most Super Bowl titles? Tom Brady’s seven Super Bowl titles are the most of any quarterback and player in NFL history. NFL Playoffs results from the last 10 years. 2024. Super Bowl LVIII: Chiefs (25) vs. 49ers (22) NFC Championship: 49ers (34) vs. Lions (31) AFC Championship: Chiefs (17) vs. Ravens (10) 2023 
That peculiar seed matchup marked the first Super Bowl in the modern seeding era where neither a No. 1 nor a No. 2 seed was in the game. Of course, it was a short-lived trend in that the 2023 matchup pitted No. 1 seeds against one another. 
Our loss to the #4 seeded AFC Ravens in the 2013 Super Bowl just happened to be one of those times an NFC #1 seed lost. How many times have the two No. 1 seeds made it to the Super Bowl? Believe it or not, No. 1 vs. No. 1 has happened only 13 times in the previous 48 Super Bowls since the NFL implemented playoff seeding during the 1975 season. 
Pick: 1-seed Lions reach the first Super Bowl in franchise history by corralling Saquon Barkley and the 2-seed Eagles. Super Bowl 2025 prediction Pick: The Lions' ride ends without a trophy Feb. 9  
Both teams were also No. 1 seeds, marking the first time that had happened in 16 seasons.  the longest kick return in Super Bowl history. Soon after, the game was suspended for 34 minutes due  
The No. 1 seed in the AFC now heads to New Orleans for a Super Bowl rematch against the Philadelphia Eagles,  take a look back at the Chiefs’ Super Bowl history. Super Bowl LVIII, 2024. 
Now they would become the only franchise in the modern playoff era to win a Super Bowl as the No. 6 seed and lose a Super Bowl to a 6-seed. The Packers built leads of 14-0 in the second quarter and 21-10 in the third, then held on to beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round 21-16, sealing the victory by intercepting Michael Vick in  </p>
