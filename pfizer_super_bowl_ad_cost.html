        <p>Pfizer declined to comment on how much it spent on the ad, though CBS has reported that the price tag for a 30-second Super Bowl ad was $6.5 million to $7 million — and Pfizer’s ad was 60  
Here's what 30-second Super Bowl ads have cost through the years: Super Bowl 1, 1967 – $37,500; Super Bowl 2, 1968 – $54,500; Super Bowl 3, 1969 – $55,000; Super Bowl 4, 1970 – $78,200;

It is estimated that the ad cost Pfizer $7 million to $14 million for the Super Bowl ad time and another $7 million for what it cost to make the commercial. Pfizer has been laying off workers since last year, with more expected in 2024. 
The cost for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial has hit new heights, with ads being sold for about $8 million in the weeks leading up to the game, according to multiple reports.

Pfizer ran its first-ever Super Bowl ad “Here’s to science,” which included a lineup of scientists who stood at the frontier of knowledge. Alongside  
The 2024 Super Bowl had something for everyone. You had a strong match-up for the sports fans, a wild halftime show with Usher, and the best commercials $7 million can buy. Let's not forget Taylor  
The Wall Street Journal reported that securing a 30-second slot during the Super Bowl cost companies roughly $7 million this year, excluding the additional expense of producing the ad itself. This raises questions about the potential total cost for Pfizer, considering they laid off several employees in 2023 and 2024. 
Super Bowl spots this year cost a cool $7 million for 30 seconds (arguably a bargain, given that the biggest audience since the moon landing watched Sunday’s game). This ad ran a full minute, so $14 million.
