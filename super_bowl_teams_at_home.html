        <h2><strong>super bowl teams at home super bowl justin timberlake incident</strong></h2>
        <p>Only two teams have experienced a home Super Bowl, and both did it this decade: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams. Bizarrely enough, they achieved the landmark accomplishment in  
The Los Angeles Rams could become the 2nd NFL team to host a Super Bowl.  Both the Rams and 49ers have come close to hosting a home Super Bowl in the past. According to NBC Sports, “the Los  
The Kansas City Chiefs pulled it off against the San Francisco 49ers, 25 to 22, at home in Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024. 
A team has never played a Super Bowl game in their home stadium, but twice teams have played in their home area: In 1980, the Los Angeles Rams played in the Super Bowl in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, about 15 miles from their home stadium, and in 1985, the San Francisco 49ers played in Stanford Stadium, about 25 miles from their home stadium. 
Super Bowl finalist playing at home for second straight year With their win over the San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles will become the second team in NFL history to play the Super Bowl in their  
Home Team Rule in a Super Bowl. The American Football Conference team is the home team in even-numbered Super Bowls and the National Football Conference team is considered the home team in odd-numbered Super Bowls. In 2024 we had the LVIII Super Bowl, or 58th Super Bowl. Therefore, the Kansas City Chiefs of the AFC were the home team. 
During Super Bowl LIX, the Eagles will be considered the home team against the Chiefs. All things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more. 
The home team at the Super Bowl gets to determine which uniforms it will wear. That usually forces the visitor into wearing the opposite, as NFL teams have colored uniform tops at home and white  
With the home team designation flipping every season, that means in odd-numbered Super Bowls the NFC is the designated home team, and the AFC is the designated home team in even-numbered Super Bowls. 
The Buccaneers' 31-26 win over the Green Bay Packers clinched them becoming the first team in NFL history to play in a Super Bowl hosted at their home stadium. The Bucs will face the AFC champion

The Chiefs have only lost one SB wearing the red, which was Super Bowl 55 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers when Tampa was the home team. Of their five Super Bowl appearances, KC owns a 2-1 overall  
Given that the Chiefs are headed for a potential three-peat and would be the first team ever to do so, and they beat the Eagles 38-35 in Super Bowl LVII (57) on February 12, 2023, that seems about  
Super Bowl XV took place on January 25, 1981, a few days after the end of the Iran Hostage Crisis. The victorious Oakland Raiders and the Philadelphia Eagles scored the same point values scored at the last Super Bowl in New Orleans, 27-10. The Raiders had the distinction of being the very first wild card playoff team to win a Super Bowl. 
For the most part, NFL teams wear a darker jersey at home and road teams wear a white one. When it comes to the Super Bowl, the record suggests that a white jersey is the way to go. 
This means an NFC team gets to be home in odd-numbered Super Bowls, and AFC teams are home for even-numbered Super Bowls. This first started during Super Bowl I, when the Green Bay Packers (NFC) were considered the home team. What Does It Mean to Be the Home Team in the Super Bowl? The Super Bowl is played at a location predetermined before the  
Origins of Super Bowl Home/Away Process. The NFL prefers an alternating format. In one game, the NFC becomes the home rep. The following year, the AFC team gets the home designation. And the process rotates each game. This has long been the format for the Super Bowl since the first-ever contest between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City  
Here's a breakdown of the teams with the most Super Bowl wins since the game's inception after the 1966 season: 6: Pittsburgh Steelers (1975-76, 1979-80, 2006, 2009); New England Patriots (2002
