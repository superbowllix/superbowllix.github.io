Georgia is one of only two schools (USC) to have three different players win Super Bowl MVP. Michigan, of course, holds the record for most total MVPs (6) - Tom Brady’s 5 help - but the Bulldogs  
In what was arguably the greatest Super Bowl effort by a tailback, he ran for 157 yards and a record-tying three TDs – while combating a migraine – on his way to Super Bowl 32 MVP honors as the Denver Broncos won their first title. The former Georgia star played with the Bulldogs from 1992-1994. Terrell Davis won two Super Bowls. 
Since then, at least one former Georgia player has participated in each Super Bowl, with 20 of the 24 games featuring more than one Bulldog. The last time just one former Bulldog played in the

Some surprising schools on the list are represented by the 58 Super Bowl MVP winners. Whether you view that in the negative or positive light, it can be eye-opening. Perhaps that is due to the recency bias of Michigan being at the top. Some national powers on this list don't have a Super Bowl MVP that might surprise you such as Auburn, LSU, or  
In eight NFL seasons, Davis was a 3x All-Pro selection, the 1998 NFL MVP and a 2x Super Bowl champion. With a 157-yard rushing effort combined with 3 TD’s, Davis won Super Bowl XXXII MVP honors following Denver’s upset win over Brett Favre and the Packers.

He was also a five-time first or second team All-Pro, and won back-to-back Super Bowl Championships in 1972 and 1973, including winning the MVP of Super Bowl VII. [ 2 ] Scott wore number 13 throughout his career, which was later made famous in Miami by Dan Marino , and has since been retired in Marino's honor. 
Tyler Forness: (Editor's note: Forness picked the Chiefs to win in our predictions post) The Super Bowl MVP has gone to a player on the winning team in every instance but one: Super Bowl V when Dallas Cowboys LB Chuck Howley won the award in a 16-13 loss to the Baltimore Colts.

On February 5, 2006, Ward played in his first career Super Bowl. In Super Bowl XL, he accumulated 5 receptions, 123 receiving yards, and caught a 43-yard touchdown reception from wide receiver Antwaan Randle El to seal the Steelers' 21–10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks.

Five Georgia Bulldogs are on the rosters of the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, who are playing in the Super Bowl this weekend. Wide receiver Mecole Hardman and defensive lineman Malik Herring are on the Kansas City Chiefs. Tight end Charlie Woerner, wide receiver Chris Conley and linebacker Robert Beal are on the San Francisco 49ers. 
Georgia football has multiple former players in this Sunday’s Super Bowl, including star running backs Todd Gurley and Sony Michel. With two superstar running backs representing Georgia football on their respective teams this Sunday at the Super Bowl, there’s a good chance Bulldogs might see their fourth Super Bowl MVP crowned this weekend. 
Additionally, Davis was named Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl XXXII against the then-world champion Green Bay Packers, with 157 rushing yards and a Super Bowl record three rushing touchdowns despite having to sit out the second quarter due to a migraine. Prior to this 31–24 victory, the Broncos had lost each of their four previous Super Bowl
