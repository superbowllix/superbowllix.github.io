Yesterday's Super Bowl LV between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers resulted in a 31-9 win for Tom Brady and co., but in the meme world, The Weeknd's halftime  
The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of live sports, drawing in roughly 100 million viewers to watch the NFL championship each year. And like any live event, there’s always unexpected fun to be had that quickly turns into hilarious Super Bowl memes.

The Kansas City Chiefs won the game 31-20, marking the team's first NFL championship since Super Bowl IV, fifty seasons ago. The teams played to a 10-10 tie in the first half, with the 49ers conservatively electing not to attempt to score at the end of the first half, though they had two minutes and all of their timeouts. 
Donald Trump's tweet is genuine but is from the Chiefs' Super Bowl win in 2020, also against the 49ers. The date of Trump's tweet can be seen in Republicans Against Trump's post.
