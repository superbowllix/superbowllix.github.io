        <p>The 2nd tv is def worse. Normally we could have 3 tvs and an iPad w the same football game running w no issue. I did NOT upgrade to 4k bc I didn’t want to chance streaming issues.

Update 2 (February 12, 2024) 08:33 am (IST): Just about a year later, it seems YouTube TV still hasn’t managed to get a grip on its servers during the Super Bowl. Reports on X suggest that many users are facing issues with YouTube TV buffering or the video quality appearing pixelated.

No problems. But I'm getting terrible quality and constant freezes throughout the game and now halftime show. I only bought YT TV for football season, now I'm 100% dropping it after this. Especially embarrassing because I have friends over for the game. Edit: I've read all the comments, and feel like I can't blame YouTube TV at this point. 
Multiple Youtube TV users are reporting constant buffering or pausing during Super Bowl matches. The interruptions prevent them from enjoying the game. The streaming rights for NFL and Super Bowl games have been awarded to YouTube TV, the TV service born from the popular video platform. However, not everything has gone exactly as planned.

If you have trouble with your Super Bowl stream tomorrow — on Paramount Plus or a live streaming service such as YouTube TV or DIRECTV Stream — here are six actions you can try to fix the issue: 1. Change the channel. Then, go back to your original channel or show. 
Paramount+ and YouTube TV customers experienced delays mostly early on in the stream of Super Bowl LVIII. Some Fubo viewers report experiencing problems into the second half of the game. 
And, for the most part, YouTube TV seems to handle these live events quite well. For the 2024 Super Bowl, though, some users seem to be having trouble watching through YouTube TV. 
According to a recent Phenix survey of 1,014 adults in the US who stream sports, 14 percent of respondents said they’d want to place bets live during the Super Bowl.

I have yet to watch a major sporting event without it freezing. And it’s not my ISP either. It’s Fubo. I got a trial of YouTube TV for the playoff games to test and there were no issues with You Tube while Fubo completely froze during second half. I was streaming on AppleTV with same firmware updates.

Paramount Plus went down for many viewers who were trying to tune in to watch the Kansas City Chiefs play the San Francisco 49ers in the 2024 Super Bowl on February 11, 2024.. According to KRON4

That wouldn't have helped, as YouTube TV requires Internet, we get Internet from Spectrum, and the Internet and our phone stopped working each time there was a Super Bowl picture problem (freezing).

It was the dedicated streaming selection for the Super bowl. I opened up Paramount Plus (phone app, PC / web browser and TV VR Roku) and top center is the Super Bowl banner taking up almost whatever view you have. In the lower left of the Savannah is the WATCH NOW . Clicked on it and Face The Nation showed up instead of the Super bowl. 
Youtube TV and the Fox Sports app worked flawlessly on AT&amp;T and Verizon LTE connections via hotspots which I had to fall back on during the second quarter.
