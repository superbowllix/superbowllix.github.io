        <p>The New York Jets are one of the oldest teams in the NFL and play in the AFC East Division. Unlike their counterparts the New York Giants, the Jets have a comparatively bleak Super Bowl history  
The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL. The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) – winning the last two. 
The New York Jets have won the Super Bowl only once, in 1968, beating the Baltimore Colts 16-7. See the full list of all Jets championships and appearances, along with scores, dates and opponents. 
As heavy underdogs at Super Bowl III, the Jets represented the AFL with distinction as they defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts. The Jets became the first AFL team to defeat an NFL team in their combined championship game. When was the last New York Jets Super Bowl win? As noted, the Jets have been in just one Super Bowl, which they won in 1969.

However, the Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl, making them one of two NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance along with the New Orleans Saints, and one of five teams never to win a conference championship since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, along with the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and two expansion franchises, the

Super Bowl III was an American football championship game played on January 12, 1969, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.It was the third AFL–NFL Championship Game in professional American football, and the first to officially bear the trademark name "Super Bowl". [3] 
The New York Jets last played a home playoff game on Jan 4, 2003, nearly 23 years ago, when they hosted the Colts in the Wild Card Round of the 2002 NFL playoffs, in which the Jets scored a 41-0 win. When was the last time the Jets lost a playoff game? 
It’s January 12th, 1969 at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida; three days after Joe Namath’s guarantee that the New York Jets will win the Super Bowl. A whistle blows and the New York Jets line up on the the Baltimore Colts’ four yard line. The stadium seems to grow quiet, as Joe looks up and down the line, then calls for the snap. 
When was the last time the New York Giants lost the Super Bowl? The New York Giants last lost the Super Bowl in the 2000 season. The Giants lost to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 34-7. Have the New York Giants ever won consecutive Super Bowls? No, the New York Giants have never won consecutive Super Bowls. 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year.

Namath cemented his legacy in 1969 when he guaranteed his heavy underdog Jets would win Super Bowl III before defeating the NFL's Baltimore Colts in one of the greatest sports upsets of all time. The Super Bowl victory was the first for an AFL franchise, helping dismiss notions that its teams were inferior to the NFL's and demonstrating they  
Super Bowl III 50th Anniversary Celebration. The New York Jets, led by quarterback Joe Namath, rocked the sports world and the country on Jan. 12, 1969, by becoming the first American Football League team to defeat an NFL team with their 16-7 Super Bowl III victory over the heavily favored Baltimore Colts at Miami's Orange Bowl. 
January 12, 1969, was the chance for two fresh faces — the New York Jets of the AFL and the Baltimore Colts of the NFL — to grace the big stage for the first time and make or break the NFL’s unbroken win streak at the Super Bowl. 
On January 12, 1969, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, the New York Jets of the American Football League defeat the NFL’s Baltimore Colts, 16‑7, in Super Bowl III—a result considered one of the  </p>
