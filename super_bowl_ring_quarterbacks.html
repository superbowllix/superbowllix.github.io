Hurts does not have a Super Bowl ring, as he is 0-1 in big game. However, when the Eagles played the Chiefs in Super Bowl 57, Hurts had one of the better performances for quarterbacks in a losing  
As Super Bowl 59 approaches this Sunday, all eyes are on Patrick Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs’ superstar quarterback, who is on the verge of potentially securing his fourth Super Bowl ring.
