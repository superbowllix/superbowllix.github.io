        <p>He led the NFL with 117 points in 1971, [9] [10] and in Super Bowl VI, he scored the only three Dolphin points against the Dallas Cowboys. [11] The next year, he was a key member of the 1972 Miami Dolphins "Perfect Season" team — he was the leading scorer and converted on many clutch field goals to help the Dolphins stay unbeaten. [12] 
In Super Bowl VII Miami Dolphins K Garo Yepremian had his kick blocked by the Washington Redskins, and it just got worse from there for him. He fielded the b 
Garo Yepremian, the former NFL kicker who helped the Miami Dolphins win consecutive NFL championships but is best remembered for a Super Bowl blooper, died Friday of cancer. He was 70. 
During practice the day before Super Bowl VII, the Dolphins' 5'7" 150-pound kicker, Garo Yepremian, relaxed by throwing 30-yard passes to Dave Shula, Don Shula's son. During the pregame warmups, he consistently kicked low line drives and couldn't figure out why. [26] This was the first Super Bowl in which neither coach wore a tie. 
In that season’s Super Bowl, the Dolphins fell short against the Cowboys, 24–3, Yepremian’s field goal marking Miami’s only points. The 1972 Dolphins were built in their coach’s image  
The Miami Dolphins averaged 10 wins per season, made the postseason six times, and won two Super Bowl titles during Garo Yepremian’s nine years in South Florida from 1970 to 1978. They regularly competed against Chuck Noll’s Pittsburgh Steelers and John Madden’s Oakland Raiders for supremacy in the AFC during that memorable 1970s decade. 
Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian's infamous missed field goal and failed pass attempt against the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII comes in as the No. 75 play in NFL history.

But the 1971 Christmas Day playoff game between the Miami Dolphins and Kansas City Chiefs was decided by a 5-foot-7, 170-pound, balding, Cyprus-born kicker/tiemaker who became best known for one  
Super Bowl 17: The Dolphins trail the 49ers by 1 with 5 seconds left on the clock. Miami Kicker Ray Finkle from 26 yards out – misses. Wide Right. Only Finkle knows why he really missed that kick – Dan Marino held the ball laces in. Watch the video below for the rest of the story 
Super Bowl XIX was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Miami Dolphins and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1984 season. 
Super Bowl XVII was the Redskins' first Super Bowl victory (third NFL championship overall) and their second Super Bowl appearance; they were defeated by the Dolphins, 14–7, in Super Bowl VII. This was the second rematch in Super Bowl history (the first being the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowls X and XIII  
Jay Feely transitioned from a side gig as a kicker in the Arena Football League to forging a 14-year NFL career during which time he led the league in field goals made in 2002, earned a Pro Bowl nod in 2005, and set a then-franchise record in field goal percentage for the Miami Dolphins in 2007. 
The Dolphins defeated the Washington Redskins 14-7 in Super Bowl VII on Jan. 14, 1973 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to finish 17-0. 
Miami Dolphins: 1967. A journeyman kicker who plied his trade across several teams in the 1960s, Booth Lusteg's time with the Miami Dolphins was short-lived but memorable. Known for his powerful leg and unorthodox kicking style, Lusteg brought excitement and flair to the Dolphins' special teams during his brief stint with the team.

He converted on all four of his field goal attempts, from 39, 24, 57 and 52 yards. His 57-yard field goal, with two seconds remaining in the opening half, gave Miami a 15-13 lead. The kick tied his career long, which he had set in Miami's win over Dallas on Dec. 24, 2023. </p>
