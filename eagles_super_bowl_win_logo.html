        <h2><strong>eagles super bowl win logo taylor swift super bowl bets vegas</strong></h2>
        <p>super bowl 59: predictions | picks against the spread Did Super Bowl logo predict Chiefs vs. Eagles? This year's logo was designed by a local New Orleans artist, Taj Williams. 
From 1967's Super Bowl II until 2009's Super Bowl XLIV, the game's logo included various colors, fonts and designs. In its earliest days, red, white and blue dominated -- until the early 1990s. 
The NFL unveiled the logo for Super Bowl LVIII one day after that Chiefs win. The design went all-in on Las Vegas, which hosted the game for the first time in its history on Feb. 11, 2024. 
As the two teams for this year's Super Bowl is set, fans claim the Super Bowl logo theory strikes again.  2025, the only dominant green jersey/logo team would win (Philadelphia Eagles). 
The next year, the NFL rolled out a colorful, desert-themed logo for Super Bowl LVII in Glendale, Arizona. The Chiefs’ red and Eagles’ green were among the hues in the logo, and the Chiefs wound up beating the Eagles to earn their second Super Bowl in four seasons. The NFL unveiled the logo for Super Bowl LVIII one day after that Chiefs win  
For the first two years of the new generation of Super Bowl logos, the colors on the logo have lined up with the game’s eventual matchup — Bengals vs. Rams and then Chiefs vs. Eagles. 
The Super Bowl logo conspiracy theory is roaring back to life with the 2025 Chiefs vs. Eagles matchup. Here’s why Is it a coincidence that the Super Bowl 59 logo has the same colors as the two  
The teams playing in the Super Bowl have been determined after two exciting games on Sunday. The Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles for the championship in two weeks. However  
In 2022, The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 23-20, in Super Bowl LVI - which featured orange and yellow in its logo. One year later, Super Bowl LVII featured green and red lettering well before the Chiefs bested the Eagles 38-35. This isn’t to say, however, that the Super Bowl logo theory is perfect. 
The logo for Super Bowl 57 featured green and red as its colors, and featured the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs facing off against each other. But the conspiracy seemed to die last year in Super Bowl LVIII when the purple and red logo failed to predict the matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers. 
This year's Super Bowl is another rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. The last time the two teams faced off at the Super Bowl was in 2023. At the time, majority of  
There was the overlooked quarterback, the underestimated head coach, and the demoted general manager, all of whom banded together to form the foundation of Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl-winning team. The 2017-18 Eagles embodied the spirit and the persona and the bite of their hometown. A team of  
Retired NFL star Jason Kelce talks to TODAY.com about the Philadelphia Eagles-Kansas City Chiefs 2025 Super Bowl game and why he doesn't feel he's missing out. 
9. Zach Ertz, tight end . Three-time Pro Bowl tight end Zach Ertz played a crucial role in the Birds' first and only Super Bowl win. Ertz caught seven passes for 67 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown to put the Eagles up 38-33 over the New England Patriots. 
The Eagles entered the season 11-1 to win the Super Bowl and +550 to win the NFC. They were tied for the second favorites to win the NFC entering the season with the Lions, trailing the 49ers (+260). 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
Saquon Barkley isn't satisfied with just making a Super Bowl 59 appearance. "The dream wasn't just getting there, the dream was winning it," Barkley said after the Philadelphia Eagles' 55-23 win  
The Eagles finished with a losing record in the bus’ first eight seasons before reaching the playoffs in 1978. Dick Vermeil was the head coach and there was hope. Two years later, they were NFC champions. The Eagles, finally, were headed to the Super Bowl. The bus was old but it had to be there. 
Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. [150] Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2002's Super Bowl XXXVI. [151] </p>
