Jason, CBS will stream tomorrow’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers on Paramount Plus, the company’s subscription streaming service. This is a great convenience for cord cutters who no longer subscribe to cable or satellite. But streaming sports can sometimes come with frustration, too.

Paramount's Super Bowl livestream problems are a warning for Netflix and the new mega sports streamer Peter Kafka , Chief Correspondent covering media and technology 2024-02-12T21:29:03Z 
I got the trial bc of the Super Bowl. The lag and pausing and even glitches were so aggravating. I felt like the Super Bowl was an ad to not pay for paramount. And I chalked it up to millions of people watching it at once. Nope. I have tried two separate times after to watch and it’s the same exact thing. Edit: I’m on an LG tv experiencing this 
With Paramount Plus, you can stream NFL games on CBS, but since it is on FOX this year, you won’t be able to watch Super Bowl 57 without a live-streaming service that carries FOX. If you are a new subscriber, you can stream it with a 7-Day Free Trial of fuboTV or a 5-Day Free Trial of DIRECTV STREAM . 
Last night, PRIOR TO SUPER BOWL, Rather than take the "1 week F REE trial" at Paramount+ online, I just renewed My Roku Paramount. Billed $5.99, but figured I could watch for a month. NO Super Bowl on Roku! Black screen like EVERYONE is complaining about. Went to Paramount+.com &amp; PAID AGAIN with a new credit card. 
Paramount Plus offers help for black screen issues. They have online resources and a support team to assist users with streaming problems. Using Paramount Plus Help Section. The Paramount Plus Help Section is a good starting point for fixing black screen issues. It has tips for common problems. Users can check if their device is supported. 
It was the dedicated streaming selection for the Super bowl. I opened up Paramount Plus (phone app, PC / web browser and TV VR Roku) and top center is the Super Bowl banner taking up almost whatever view you have.

Access your device Settings, find the Paramount Plus app, and choose the Clear Cache option. Here we take FireStick or Fire TV as an example: you can clear cache on FireStick by navigating to Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Manage Installed Applications &gt; choose an app to clear its cache &gt; press the Rewind button to clear the cache. 
Tuning into the Super Bowl used to be easy — flick on the TV and find the broadcast channel or channels it was airing on. It’s still that way, but for cord-cutters that don’t have a TV  
The Super Bowl won’t be streamed in 4K on the Paramount Plus platform. Who will be providing the commentary for the Super Bowl 2024? CBS’s main announcers, Jim Nantz and Tony Romo, will be in the broadcast booth, whereas, Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn will be reporting from the sidelines. 
This direct-to-consumer streaming service offers movies and series from ViacomCBS. It includes content from Paramount film studios, CBS, and MTV. This is a fan-run community and is in no way authorized, sponsored, or endorsed by ViacomCBS, Paramount, etc. 
Paramount+ subscribers with the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME plan can start their Super Bowl party one day early, on Saturday, February 10, 2024, by streaming, via their live, local CBS station, the CBS broadcasts of the Super Bowl LVIII Countdown Show at 12 PM, ET, followed by That Other Pregame Show (TOPS) at 1 PM ET. </p>
