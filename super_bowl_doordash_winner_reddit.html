DoorDash is going to need a bigger truck. The meal and product delivery app, which held a massive sweepstakes during the 2024 Super Bowl-- wherein one lucky viewer could enter a code for the  
DoorDash drew one lucky contest's name on Monday to win its "All the Ads" Super Bowl sweepstakes that included a prize pool of approximately 2,468 items totaling $480,000. 
Someone won every item advertised during the Super Bowl, thanks to a wild DoorDash ad DoorDash's wild 'all-the-ads-2024-promocode' caught the internet by storm 
In a tweet, DoorDash said the winner will be contacted Monday. Despite the ad's popularity across social media, it didn't make one list of the "best ads" from the 2024 Super Bowl. 
DoorDash has announced a sweepstakes that will reward whoever cracks the code of "all the ads" during its Super Bowl commercial. It will give its winner, quite literally, everything that appears  
A look at the top Super Bowl ads 06:07. DoorDash is gifting one lucky Super Bowl fan nearly half a million dollars' worth of gifts such as cars, gift cards and phones seen during this year's game. 
DoorDash’s Super Bowl commercial sweepstake named ‘DoorDash All the Ads’ gave participants the chance to win an insane $340,000 prize list by entering an extremely long promo code. By

DoorDash's wild Super Bowl ad caught the internet by storm. Now, it's prepping delivery of the dozens of items -- including 30 pounds of mayonnaise, and three cars -- to one lucky winner. 
A few of my reliable restaurants were closed (Super Bowl night is notoriously slow for restaurant dine-in service so some small places close) and the ones that were open were packed and had long waits. My plan for tomorrow is to make as much money as I can before the game. I might TRY after the game starts, but I'll be keeping my expectations low. 
Honestly surprised it hasn’t been posted yet. The winner of the DoorDash promo than ran during their Super Bowl ad is from here! Keep an eye on the road for the delivery trucks! 
It’s Super Bowl Sunday. If people don’t wanna leave their house to get food or whatever they want, they’re gonna have to pay me a Super Bowl Surcharge. If I have to get out and bring people their crap because they don’t wanna miss the game, they’re gonna pay a little extra for the service today. 
Lol it’ll be dead an hour after kick off dude. I dashed the past couple superbowls. Rn its dead as shit in my market. Did 1 $10 order in the past two hours. 
I've done food delivery for years and super bowl is usually massively underwhelming. Large orders but usually small tips and most of the orders come in right before the game starts. This wasn't door dash though it was usually working at a local shop 
watch now doordash-all-the-ads sweepstakes doordash-all-the-ads 53 watch now 1752 enter promo code this year, during football's biggest event, doordash will doordash stuff from all the ads. because doordash can doordash pretty much anything. multiple cars. too many chicken wings. more snacks than any pantry can handle.
