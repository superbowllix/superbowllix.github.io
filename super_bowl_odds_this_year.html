        <h2><strong>super bowl odds this year super bowl jlo</strong></h2>
        <p>Betting on the winner in the Super Bowl, more often than not, directly results in a cover against the spread (ATS) Teams that win the Super Bowl are 49-7-2 ATS in the game, covering at an 87.5% clip. 
The best player in NFL history adds another Super Bowl MVP to his ledger to join Michael Jordan (6), Tom Brady (5) and LeBron James (4) as the only players in NFL/NBA/MLB/NHL history with at least  
Super Bowl favorites. The Chiefs (-124) and Eagles (+107) are only two teams remaining on the Super Bowl odds board. This year is a rematch from Super Bowl 57, which KC won 38-35. 
Super Bowl History For Spread And Totals Betting. Historical data shows that Super Bowl winners almost always cover the spread. A comprehensive look at past winners reveals this trend to be a constant, as the eventual winner has covered the spread in nine of the last 10 games, and 17 of the past 20. 
Philadelphia’s biggest dip in Super Bowl odds during the postseason came after the divisional round. Prior to those games, the Eagles sat at +400 to win the Super Bowl, a 20% implied probability. A win over the Rams and the Commanders’ upset win over the Lions saw Nick Sirianni’s side drop from +400 to +180, a 35.7% implied probability. 
The Super Bowl odds are based on the probability that a team has of winning the NFL championship. For example, odds of +400 mean that you would win $400 for every $100 you bet on that team to win the Super Bowl, but it also means that the team has a 20% chance of winning.

Super Bowl odds fluctuate with each win, loss, and player injury throughout the year. Long odds of making it to the big event at the beginning of the year may turn into a good chance as the season progresses. 
Super Bowl Odds. Kansas City Chiefs (+600) More: Chiefs 2023 betting lines, odds, schedule ATS. Philadelphia Eagles (+750) More: Eagles 2023 betting lines, odds, schedule ATS. San Francisco 49ers  
In last year's Super Bowl, I picked the Kansas City Chiefs to upset the San Francisco 49ers, and win by three points. That's exactly what happened.  Odds: Chiefs -1.5 O/U 48.5. 
The Kansas City Chiefs captured Super Bowl 58 and the team is listed as a +650 betting choice (Bet $100 to win $650) to three-peat in 2025. Here were the opening odds for which NFL team will win Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans later in 2025. 
First Touchdown Scorer Odds for Super Bowl LIX. Philadelphia's Saquon Barkley (+410) has the shortest odds to score first, and he's followed closely by teammate Jalen Hurts (+600). After those two, we get three K.C. players with the next shortest odds between Travis Kelce (+800), Kareem Hunt (+900), and Xavier Worthy (+1000). 
Per Polymarket odds, Super Bowl LIX’s viewership is favored to land between 115 million and 120 million (+355). 120 million to 125 million (+376) is not out of the question, either. This year, the Super Bowl will air on Fox. 
The Kansas City Chiefs will meet the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59 on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans. Let's break down the 2025 Super Bowl odds with the big game just under a fortnight away. The Chiefs have the highest ticket % (12.6%) and handle % (16.8%) to win the Super Bowl per BetMGM. 
Super Bowl 59 prediction, odds, spread, time, line: Eagles vs. Chiefs picks, bets by expert on 37-12 roll  The Chiefs (15-2), who beat San Francisco in overtime in last year's Super Bowl, are  
For this year’s Super Bowl, the Kansas City Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites over the Philadelphia Eagles with a posted total of 48.5 points. The odds on the Super Bowl have been known to change, and there’s still a few days until the game. 
Here's how the NFL's Gatorade tradition was born, this year's odds for the prop bet and which one we're throwing some spare change down on this year. SUPER BOWL ODDS: Eagles vs. Chiefs: Latest  
The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each.
