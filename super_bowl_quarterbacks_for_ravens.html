        <h2><strong>super bowl quarterbacks for ravens bengals super bowl wins history</strong></h2>
        <p>Twenty-four quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. Seven of those quarterbacks have started at least one playoff game for the Ravens. These players are listed in order of the date of each player's first start at quarterback for the Ravens. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Os quarterbacks que ganharam Super Bowls pelos Ravens foram Trent Dilfer e Joe Flacco. 
NFL.com ranked the best 66 quarterbacks to ever start a Super Bowl and two Baltimore Ravens landed on the list. Joe Flacco is the highest-ranked Raven at No. 49, followed by Trent Dilfer at No. 62.

Meanwhile, the 49ers became just the second team to lose the Super Bowl while scoring more than 30 points [130] (joining the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII; the New England Patriots would join this list in Super Bowl LII, and so would Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII). For the Ravens, Anquan Boldin was the leading receiver with 6  
That was when the Colts represented Charm City. Led by legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas, the Colts defeated the then-Oakland Raiders, 27-17. Now, 53 years later, Baltimore will hope for a long-awaited conference championship celebration  and a potential third Super Bowl parade after Feb. 11 for the Ravens. 
The Baltimore Ravens last won the Super Bowl in the 2012 season. The Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in the Super Bowl. 
Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is the first player to ever throw for more than 4,000 yards and rush for more than 800 yards in a season. Despite his impressive stats and on-field  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Dilfer signed with the Ravens in 2000 as a backup before becoming the team's starter midway through the year, which concluded with the franchise's first Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl XXXV. Despite the championship, Dilfer was not re-signed by the Ravens, becoming the first starting quarterback to be released after a Super Bowl win. 
Joe Cool himself, Joe Flacco was the epitome of a strong-armed, pocket-passing quarterback when the Ravens drafted him 18th overall. With an ice-cold demeanor under pressure, Flacco led the team to numerous playoff victories and their second Super Bowl title, earning Super Bowl MVP honors in the process. 
Joe Flacco, Tony Banks and Trent Dilfer are tied for the most career wins by a Ravens quarterback in Super Bowls, with 1 win.
