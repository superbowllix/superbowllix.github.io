        <p>June 24, 2024 answer of Three Time Super Bowl Winner Kelce clue in NYT Crossword Puzzle. There is One Answer total, Travis is the most recent and it has 6 letters. 
Kelce and Cook become the 19th and 20th UC Super Bowl champions all-time. Kelce's three Super Bowl victories are the most ever by a Bearcat. His 31 career Super Bowl receptions rank second in NFL history behind only Jerry Rice (33), and his 350 receiving yards rank fourth. Kelce is a five-time All-Pro honoree, including this fall. 
Kelce has won three Super Bowl championships. He claimed his third ring in February 2024 when the Kansas City Chiefs overpowered the San Francisco 49ers in a 25-22 OT win. 
On Sunday, the three-time Super Bowl winner didn't have a huge impact on the stat sheet, only tallying four catches for 27 yards. Still, the Chiefs got their largest win of the 2024 season, moving  
Super Bowl 55. The Chiefs returned to the Super Bowl the following season to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where Kelce delivered what was arguably his most productive Super Bowl performance. He caught 10 passes for 133 yards, converting six first downs while generating three explosive plays and averaging 2.61 yards per route run. 
In his 12-year professional career, Kelce has been a three-time Super Bowl Champion, ten-time Pro Bowl player, and four-time First-team All-Pro, as of January 2025. 
Ex-UCLA great Ken Norton Jr. may be joined by Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and other Chiefs as the only players to win three straight Super Bowls if Kansas City beats the Eagles on Sunday. 
No matter what the Chiefs say, everyone else is talking about it. No team has done it in the Super Bowl era, though the Green Bay Packers won an NFL championship in 1965 and followed by winning the first two Super Bowls. Kelce even started all the three-peat talk on stage last year when he said the team’s goal was to win three. 
Sunday’s win had a similar vibe to the 2020 Super Bowl when the Chiefs staged a dramatic rally to stun San Francisco. All three of the Chiefs' recent Super Bowl wins came after being down 10 points. 
Kelce had a throwback game in the divisional round win over Houston with seven catches for 117 yards and enters the Super Bowl with the most catches ever in the playoffs (174) and second to Hall
