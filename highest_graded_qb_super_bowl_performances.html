        <p>Seattle hung 43 points on Denver in Super Bowl 48, and Wilson was a big reason for it, being one of four quarterbacks to ever produce an elite passing grade in the Super Bowl. Wilson was especially effective in a clean pocket, improving his grade to 92.4 while completing 17 of 22 attempts for 199 yards with three big-time throws. 
Following Mahomes' performance in Sunday night's 25-22 overtime win over the 49ers, we've decided to come up with a ranking of the top quarterback performances in Super Bowl history. This was the  
Against Denver’s top-ranked scoring defense (14.1 points per game) Montana set, at the time, a Super Bowl record for touchdowns while also earning a quarterback rating of 147.6 and completing 13

With this year's Super Bowl nearly here, we rank the five greatest Super Bowl QB performances of all time. NFL. NFL Standings;  Top 5 Biggest Super Bowl Upsets In NFL History. 3. Steve Young  
Here are the 10 highest rushing yard outputs in Super Bowl history by a quarterback: Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl LVII: 70 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs, Super Bowl LVIII: 66 
That game did not earn a spot among the top 25 performances from a quarterback in the Super Bowl, but Brady did top this list with four appearances. Three quarterbacks—Brady, Montana and Kurt  
Only one other player—Drew Brees in Super Bowl XLIV—also completed over 80% of his pass attempts. The 1986 Broncos allowed 20.4 points per game, but the Giants put 39 on them. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest event in American sports and many of the game's greatest all-time quarterbacks have been labeled either a legend or a disappointment based on their Super Bowl performances and whether or not their team took home championship rings.The best quarterbacks in NFL history 
Here are the 10 highest passing yard outputs in Super Bowl history, with Brady and Warner making three appearances apiece: 1. Tom Brady, New England Patriots, Super Bowl LII: 505 
The way PFF grades work is that super negative plays don't actually affect a grade that much the same way it might for EPA. Which can be good, but it underrates the damage of a play like Hurts singlehandedly losing the ball untouched and spotting the other team 7 points. 
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS — SUPER BOWL LIV. Although the 49ers ultimately fell to the Chiefs, Bosa still recorded one of the most dominant defensive outings we have ever seen. The rookie lived in the Chiefs’ backfield, generating a whopping 12 QB pressures — most in a Super Bowl — that included one QB hit and one sack. 
2. Phil Simms, Super Bowl XXI Denver led Super Bowl XXI at halftime by the score of 10-9. But in the second half, Simms led the Giants to 24 straight points without throwing a single incomplete pass. 
That's the case for Foles, as PFF shows him having a 92.3 overall grade with a 90.7 passing grade. But it's not the case for Rodgers, PFF shows Rodgers with a 91.6 overall grade and a 91.7 passing grade for the SB. I'm not sure if the author made a mistake or if there has been some kind of adjustment since the article was written. 
Top performances include Nick Foles leading the Eagles to victory over the Patriots, Joe Namath's iconic upset with the Jets, and Joe Montana's remarkable efficiency, culminating in his legendary performance in Super Bowl XXIV. These athletes not only excelled statistically but also made significant impacts on their respective games, defining
