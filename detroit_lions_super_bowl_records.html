        <p>The Lions are one of 12 NFL teams that do not have any Super Bowl wins in franchise history. Yet while Detroit does not have a Super Bowl to its name, the franchise has won an NFL championship.

A Brief History of the Detroit Lions’ Super Bowl Journey. The Detroit Lions started in 1930. They were successful in the 1930s and 1950s. But, their Super Bowl history is different, filled with challenges and missed chances. The Rise of the Lions: 1930s to 1950s.

Free Press sports writer Dave Birkett highlights the best and worst performances of the Detroit Lions’ 48-42 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday at Ford Field.. The Lions (12-2) lost for the first time in exactly three months — when they also lost at home to Tampa Bay, 20-16, in Week 2 on Sept. 15 — and had their franchise-record 11-game win streak snapped.

Detroit is now the third team in the Super Bowl era with three wins of 35-plus points in their first 10 games of a season. They join the 1973 Falcons and 1969 Vikings in that regard. 
The Detroit Lions have made significant strides this offseason with their coaching hires, and one of the most important decisions came when they promoted Kelvin Sheppard to defensive coordinator.
