The only team to wear throwback jerseys during the Super Bowl were the Los Angeles Rams, who donned the classic blue and yellow look in 2022. But that season the Rams had designated their throwbacks as their official home jersey. 
The Philadelphia Eagles will place the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 2025. This year's big game will take place on Feb. 9, with kick-off at 6:30 p.m. ET from Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. 
Only 21 Super Bowl winners wore non-white jerseys. The longest stretch of non-white-jersey winners came from 2002 through 2004. The Patriots won Super Bowls XXXVI and XXXVIII in navy blue, while

Super Bowl 59 will see the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs don their iconic green and white jerseys, respectively. This year's matchup adds another layer to the superstition of uniform  
If you’re sensing a theme with LA here, you’re right: this is another Super Bowl where it could have been sooooo much worse.
