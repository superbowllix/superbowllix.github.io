        <h2><strong>super bowl viewership per year super bowl time starts</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four

The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). Men 18-24 placed second with a 20% increase (from 3.86 to 4.61 million) and girls 12-17 third with an 11% jump (from 2.63 to 2.85 million). 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl

Super Bowl viewership has fluctuated over the years but increased by about 26% from 2021 to 2024, while the U.S. resident population increased steadily year over year. Interestingly the trends in annual percentage change in Super Bowl viewership and annual U.S. population change are similar, though there may not be a direct correlation. 
The National Football League championship averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS , opens new tab alone on Sunday, topping last year's audience for the Super Bowl, which drew a record 115.1 million  
The Super Bowl is the most watched television broadcast in the United States, with viewership breaching the 100-million mark in recent years.  Super Bowl viewership. YEAR GAME AVG. VIEWERS  
Over the years, I have seen Super Bowl streaming numbers misreported with numbers that have no source to them and don’t match the numbers put out each year by the broadcast networks. For example, Statista produced a chart saying streaming viewership for the 2023 Super Bowl was 21.8 million, which is inaccurate. 
And while each Super Bowl always racks up year-high viewership, many anticipated a particular boost because of Taylor Swift’s attendance to support boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce  
NFL recorded an international viewership of 62.5 million in 2023 for the Super Bowl. This figure excluded the domestic viewership of 123.4 million viewers in the United States. Of the recorded international viewers in 2023, 24.1 million viewers were from Mexico, the highest viewership recorded since the game began and a 5% increase compared to

As a result, CBS's live telecast of Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024, holds the record for the largest average viewership of any live network U.S. television broadcast, with 123.7 million viewers. 
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
Fox has high standards to live up to as it broadcasts Super Bowl LIX this year. On top of the Super Bowl debut of Tom Brady (as a broadcaster, of course), the prior two games set viewership records.
