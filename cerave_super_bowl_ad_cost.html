        <h2><strong>cerave super bowl ad cost last super bowl kansas city chiefs won</strong></h2>
        <p>Here's what 30-second Super Bowl ads have cost through the years: Super Bowl 1, 1967 – $37,500; Super Bowl 2, 1968 – $54,500; Super Bowl 3, 1969 – $55,000; Super Bowl 4, 1970 – $78,200; 
For comparison, the average cost of an everyday television ad is estimated to be just under $105,000, though this can vary depending on time slot, ad length, and broadcast area. While the cost of a 2024 Super Bowl ad matches 2023's average pricing, the cost has been steadily increasing over the years, rising from 2019's average price of $4.5  
These events led to the epic conclusion of the Michael CeraVe marketing campaign – a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl (and an extended version as well). The ad featuring Cera was satirical, over-the-top and dramatic, ending with the reveal that Micheal Cera is pitching his ad idea to a team of dermatologists. 
Around 123 million viewers tuned in to watch the Chiefs take on the 49ers and the average cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad is $7 million. In contrast, Liquid Death claims 200 million people will be exposed to the winning brand's message on half a million cases. That's a CPM of $1.77 compared to Super Bowl's average CPM of $56.91. 
Marketers pay a premium for the exposure the Super Bowl offers. The cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad has grown to between $6 million and $7 million,  NYX, and CeraVe push for brand awareness. 
Super Bowl ads go big as cost hits new high 05:49. The Super Bowl marks the year's biggest day for advertising, with top brands paying millions to get their messages in front of a television  
The cost for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial has hit new heights, with ads being sold for about $8 million in the weeks leading up to the game, according to multiple reports. While Fox sold out its Super Bowl commercial inventory months in advance, broadcasters hold additional ad spots for unexpected delays in the game. 
This all built up to a 30-second ad spot for CeraVe in last Sunday’s Super Bowl. The ad reportedly cost the brand $7 million. Research dive: Glossy+ Research analyzed available Google Trends data for the week surrounding the Super Bowl to see the impact this ad had on search interest. 
State Farm, which won last year’s USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter, reprised its Super Bowl spot from earlier in the broadcast, cut down to a 30-second version from the 60-second spot that ran  
The ad ended with CeraVe emphasizing it's made with oversight from dermatologists, not Michael Cera. Online, people deemed the ad the " best Super Bowl commercial in years." 
So for Super Bowl 58, skincare brand CeraVe found its perfect partner: the aptly-named actor, Michael Cera. Known for his stilted comedy style from roles in ‘Superbad’, ‘Scott Pilgrim vs. the World’ and ‘Barbie’, the Canadian star’s chemistry with the brand goes beyond their nominative similarity. 
Super Bowl ads are known for their price tag. At $7 million for a 30-second spot, each second costs about $233K. But is it really worth it? Some say the exposure is priceless, but with a cost-per-mille (CPM) of around $71, it’s nearly ten times more expensive than digital alternatives.

L'Oréal skincare brand CeraVe made its Super Bowl debut with an ad that aired in the first quarter. CeraVe developed and executed a campaign with WPP, led by Ogilvy PR North America, in which actor Michael Cera has been rebranded as a skincare visionary, Michael CeraVe, per details shared with Marketing Dive. 
From humble beginnings in 1967, when a 30-second ad cost just $37,500, to the jaw-dropping $7 million price tag in 2023, the cost of Super Bowl advertising has skyrocketed. Hype, history, trends, and key milestones have all defined the evolution of Super Bowl ad prices. We are proud to have been a part of it for so long.
