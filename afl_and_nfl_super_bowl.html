        <p>The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (Super Bowl I). The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. 
The first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (known retroactively as Super Bowl I and referred to in contemporaneous reports, including the game's radio broadcast, as the Super Bowl) [5] was an American football game played on January 15, 1967, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. 
The fourth, and last, AFL-NFL championship game became officially known as the Super Bowl. Hunt is credited with the origin of the name. The Kansas City Star in July 1966 quoted Hunt referring to the game as the Super Bowl. Hunt said he inadvertently came up with the name after watching his two children play with a toy called a Super Ball. 
The leagues agreed to play an annual AFL-NFL World Championship Game, [27] matching the champions of each league, beginning in January 1967; the game that would eventually become known as the Super Bowl. Unlike the championship games of the leagues, which were always hosted by one of the participating teams, the interleague championship game

The Packers are the only team to threepeat, as they also accomplished the feat in the pre-playoff era (1929, 1930 and 1931). The first playoff game in the NFL was in 1932. In Super Bowl III, the AFL's New York Jets defeated the 19.5-point favorite Baltimore Colts of the NFL, 16–7. [21]

Coming off back-to-back Packers (NFL) victories and capturing the focus of over 50 million Americans, the NFL and AFL soon realized that these annual football championships were a massive hit. The two leagues officially dubbed the Third AFL–NFL Championship Game in 1969 “Super Bowl III,” the first of its kind. January 12, 1969, was the [] 
Super Bowl I was played by the Kansas City Chiefs of the AFL and the Green Bay Packers of the NFL. From 1960 to 1970, the American Football League stood on its own and rivaled with the NFL. 
Despite the AFL's New York Jets winning the previous season's Super Bowl, many sports writers and fans thought it was a fluke and continued to believe that the NFL was still superior to the AFL, and thus fully expected the Vikings to defeat the Chiefs; [7] the Vikings entered the Super Bowl as 13½ point favorites. </p>
