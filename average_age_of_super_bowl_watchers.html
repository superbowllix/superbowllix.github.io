In addition, all 12 games during this NFL postseason have seen year-over-year viewership increases. While the share of Americans planning to host or attend Super Bowl parties hasn’t returned  
The Super Bowl isn't the event it once was. 
In the 18-34 age demographic, Nielsen estimated that last year’s Super Bowl OOH viewership was 38 percent, a figure that was 13 percentage points higher than regular-season viewership for that
