        <h2><strong>super bowl viewers demographics dr dre super bowl line up</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M).

In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
The Super Bowl is more than just a football game—it’s a cultural event that brings together millions of viewers for an evening of sports, entertainment, and advertising. From viewership trends to fan opinions, we analyzed key Super Bowl statistics using results from a recent survey we conducted with 1,000 U.S. respondents. 
Super Bowl audience demographic characteristics. Diving further into Super Bowl audience demographics, we can see a lot of variety among viewers, beyond geographical segmentation. During an early 2023 survey in the US, more than 50% of respondents between the ages of 35-44 said they planned to watch the Super Bowl. 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
Super Bowl viewership has fluctuated over the years but increased by about 26% from 2021 to 2024, while the U.S. resident population increased steadily year over year. Interestingly the trends in annual percentage change in Super Bowl viewership and annual U.S. population change are similar, though there may not be a direct correlation. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
The 2024 edition of the Super Bowl, which saw the Kansas City Chiefs emerge victorious against the San Francisco 49ers was watched by over 123 million viewers in the United States, making it not  
NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
According to the custom survey, Super Bowl LVIII on Feb. 11 reached approximately 210 million viewers – nearly 2/3 of Americans – across CBS Television Network, Paramount+, Nickelodeon  
NEW YORK -- A global TV audience of 62.5 million viewers watched the Kansas City Chiefs defeat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. 
The discrepancy between the number of females and males watching the Super Bowl has been getting smaller over the last decade, according to demographic data from Nielsen Media. Based on the 111.5 million viewers who watched the Packers-Steelers Super Bowl XLV on Fox last year, 54% were male, compared to 46% female. 
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals

Increased Super Bowl viewership would jibe with the recent trend for the NFL, which in 2021 scored its best average regular-season audience since 2015. In addition, all 12 games during this NFL postseason have seen year-over-year viewership increases. While the share of Americans planning to host or attend Super Bowl parties hasn’t returned
