        <p>What teams did the Chicago Bears win the Super Bowl against? The Chicago Bears have won only one Super Bowl to date. They won the Super Bowl in 1986 against the New England Patriots. 
Super Bowl XX was played on January 26, 1986, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. This was the fourth Super Bowl and, to date, the last time in which both teams made their Super Bowl debuts. [a] The Bears entered the game after becoming the

The Chicago Bears have won the Super Bowl a single time, in the 1985 season. Additionally, the Chicago Bears have won the NFL Championship 6 times, most recently in the 1963 season. 
On January 26, 1986, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Chicago Bears score a Super Bowl record number of points to defeat the New England Patriots, 46-10, and win their first championship since 1963. 
III: The Bears taped "The Super Bowl Shuffle" at the Park West in Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 3, hours after landing in Chicago following their only loss of the season, a 38-24 defeat on Monday Night Football in Miami. Walter Payton and Jim McMahon taped their portions later via a green screen in a racquetball court at Halas Hall. 
Super Bowl XX: Chicago Bears 46, New England Patriots 10 MVP: Richard Dent | Location: Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans | Date: Jan. 26, 1986 Super Bowl XIX: San Francisco 49ers 38, Miami Dolphins 16 
The Bears won Super Bowl XX, the first one they appeared in. That season was famous for the release of the "Super Bowl Shuffle," a quintessentially '80s rap song that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 immediately following Chicago's championship and is still talked about today. 
The Bears only have one Super Bowl victory, but their 1985 team that won it all is widely regarded as one of the best squads in NFL history. Led by legendary head coach Mike Ditka, Chicago lost just one game en route to Super Bowl XX. 
As far as Bears fans were concerned, the whole world could stand still for the rally, and traffic did on Clark Street on Jan. 27, 1986, after the Bears won the Super Bowl. Bob Langer / Chicago Tribune 
This was the first, and to date only, Super Bowl win for an AFC South team.  Chicago Bears; First downs: 24: 11 First downs rushing: 12: 3 First downs passing: 11: 8 
The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. [192] The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout  
Chicago Bears owner Virginia McCaskey has died at the age of 102. During her stewardship, the Bears won a Super Bowl in 1986 and lost a second 21 years later. 
The New England Patriots got crushed by the Chicago Bears, 46 to 10, in Super Bowl XX on January 26, 1986. 
McCaskey had served as the team’s owner since 1983 when her father George Halas passed away, and under her watch the Bears made 14 playoff appearances, including winning the Super Bowl in 1986  
The Bears initially struggled but by Ditka's third season, Chicago had improved to 10-6 and reached the NFC Championship, where the Bears lost 23-0 to future Super Bowl champion San Francisco. The next season, Chicago had the franchise's best season to date, going 15-1 in the regular season and marching all the way to Super Bowl XX, where they  
The 1985 Bears rapped and shuffled their way to a win over New England in Super Bowl XX in 1986 with a colorful cast of characters, perhaps the greatest single-season achievement by any pro sports  
Vintage Chicago Tribune: The Chicago Bears beat the New England Patriots 46-10 to win Super Bowl XX ‘I don’t look to be in the spotlight. I think it’s a man’s world as far as the Chicago  
During her 42-year tenure as Bears owner, she presided over the team’s only Super Bowl win to date in 1986. Since then, the team has made it to the Super Bowl one other time in 2007 when the  
This Super Bowl victory is still the only one in Bears history with the 40-year anniversary coming up this season. The second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history and also under McCaskey’s ownership came in the 2006 season. Devin Hester’s iconic kick return was the highlight of the game that did not bounce Chicago’s way. </p>
