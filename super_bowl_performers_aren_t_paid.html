        <h2><strong>super bowl performers aren t paid super bowl setup</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl halftime show, despite hosting some of the world's biggest stars and attracting massive audiences, does not pay its performers. However, there's a specific reason for it. What began as a way to keep fans entertained during the Super Bowl's midgame break gradually evolved into a major spectacle. 
Why Super Bowl Halftime Performers Aren’t Paid An Appearance Fee. From the NFL’s perspective, the payment is the exposure. According to the NFL, 123 million Americans watched Super Bowl LVIII  
The NFL once looked at whether musicians would pay for the privilege because the Super Bowl halftime performance has such enormous value and is seen by over 100 million people. According to estimates, the production expenditures for Beyoncé’s unpaid 2013 performance came to over $600,000. 
Covered. So while they don't walk away with cash in hand, they definitely aren’t out of pocket. It’s All About the Exposure. Performing at the Super Bowl is like hitting the jackpot for publicity. Take Usher, for example. He was paid precisely £0 for the 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show, but the exposure gave him a massive boost. 
Promotion for the artist and their music usually ramps up in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl halftime show. In 2024, Apple Music ran free trials to promote all of Usher’s music ahead of  
The surprising truth is that halftime performers aren't paid to perform at the Super Bowl. Per league policy, the NFL covers all costs related to the production of the halftime show, but the  
Usher attends the 2022 Beloved Benefit at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on July 07, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia. Marcus Ingram/Getty. No. Like past performers, no one is paid for their halftime show performance. 
Rihanna will not be paid to perform at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show on Sunday. The singer and beauty mogul is set to take the stage on Sunday, February 12, at halftime but won't be getting  
When Beyonce first performed at the Super Bowl without a fee in 2013, production costs alone amounted to $600,000. The halftime show is a great chance for artists to boost their music sales. 
The first Super Bowl halftime show had marching bands and two men in jet packs. A hot air balloon crashed into the stands during halftime of Super Bowl 4. And Coca-Cola shipped out 26 million pairs of 3D glasses in 1989 for a disastrous halftime show at Super Bowl 23 that featured strange graphics and a magician named “Elvis Presto.” 
Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg at Coachella. The pair will be paid a union-mandated minimum fee for performing at Super Bowl LVI Getty. The NFL's vice president of communications, Brian McCarthy, says  
Wild, but true. Historically, the NFL doesn't pay Super Bowl halftime performers, but that's because the coveted 13-minute slot is essentially A) a free concert smack in the middle of a football  
The NFL may cover travel costs for artists, but maintains its long-standing tradition of not paying performers for the pregame and halftime shows beyond the minimum union scale requirements. 
According to a Sports Illustrated report, Usher was paid "$671 for the actual performance last year and about $1,800 for the rehearsals leading up to the Super Bowl." 
The first Super Bowl came together late, so naturally, the halftime festivities came even later. AZ Central notes it was only a few days before Christmas 1966 when Jack Lee, University of Arizona Marching band director, got a phone call asking his band to play at the AFL-NFL Championship Game. 
Just a few years ago, the league floated the idea of making artists pay to perform at the Super Bowl. That did not sit well with artists. “I put my foot down very early in the courtship,” Katy Perry told The Associated Press in 2015 after her Super Bowl halftime performance. “I said, ‘Look guys, here’s where I draw a line in the sand.’ 
Rihanna Did Not Get Paid for Jaw-Dropping Super Bowl Halftime Show — Here's Why. Halftime show performers may not receive a paycheck for their high-profile sets, but the NFL does cover  
More than 123.4 million viewers tuned in for Usher’s halftime show at last year’s Super Bowl, edging out Rihanna's performance in Glendale as the most-watched Super Bowl in history. That’s  
How much do artists get paid for the Super Bowl Halftime Show? As it turns out, artists do not get paid for the Super Bowl Halftime Show—at least not by the NFL. The NFL does, however, cover all  
And Spotify reports that JLo and Shakira's streams surged by 335% and 230% respectively following their joint performance in 2020. How's that for Super Bowl trivia?
