        <h2><strong>nfl super bowl viewers by year super bowl wins player</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
The NFL reported that 62.5 million people outside of the United States watched the 2024 Super Bowl LVIII between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs — a 10% increase over 2023's  
The NFL said that last year's Super Bowl drew in 62.5 million global viewers, which was a 10 percent increase from the year prior. Mexico and Canada combined for over 42 million viewers, but  
The average viewership number for this Super Bowl was 114,810,000. The air date for Super Bowl XLIX was on February 1, 2015. 2. Super Bowl LVII: Kansas City Chiefs vs Philadelphia Eagles. Super Bowl LVII was aired on FOX. While the Chiefs and Eagles will square off in this year’s Super Bowl, they also faced each other two years ago in the  
The Super Bowl, the NFL’s championship game since 1967, is the most consistently watched program in the history of American television, and the most viewed TV show in any given year. 
“No matter how or where viewers watch the game–at home with family and friends, at a bar, or streaming–Nielsen has the advanced measurement capabilities to capture the audience for the biggest TV event of the year.” The broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII ran from approximately 6:40 PM ET to 10:45 PM ET on CBS, Univision, Nickelodeon and Nick  
5. Super Bowl LI (2017) brought in 111.32 million viewers. The New England Patriots won against the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34 to 28. 6. Super Bowl XLV (2011) brought in 111 million viewers  
The Super Bowl proved to be a record-breaking culmination of an already historically impressive year for NFL games—matchups during the 2023 regular season drew an average of 17.9 million viewers  
According to the custom survey, Super Bowl LVIII on Feb. 11 reached approximately 210 million viewers – nearly 2/3 of Americans – across CBS Television Network, Paramount+, Nickelodeon  
The record-breaking Super Bowl capped a strong season for the NFL, which had already blown past viewership records in the weeks leading up to its epic conclusion at Allegiant Stadium, with the NFC  
Super Bowl LVI cracked the 100-million viewer mark in a turnaround from viewership of last year's big game, marking a strong finish to an NFL postseason rife with late-game drama and thrilling  
The Super Bowl proved to be a record-breaking culmination of an already historically impressive year for NFL games—matchups during the 2023 regular season drew an average of 17.9 million viewers  
The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). Men 18-24 placed second with a 20% increase (from 3.86 to 4.61 million) and girls 12-17 third with an 11% jump (from 2.63 to 2.85 million). 
At first glance, Super Bowl Sunday’s lineup of brands and celebrities touting them to a global audience looks standard. Viewers tuning into the Feb. 9 game on Fox will be greeted by the usual  
Super Bowl XX became the first game to surpass 90 million viewers and it would take another 20 years for the NFL to break 100 million viewers, as 106.5 million tuned in to watch Drew Brees and  
NEW ORLEANS — Throughout the years, the Super Bowl halftime show has proven to sometimes be more memorable than the game itself. A wardrobe malfunction turned national incident. A perfectly  
Over the years, I have seen Super Bowl streaming numbers misreported with numbers that have no source to them and don’t match the numbers put out each year by the broadcast networks. For example, Statista produced a chart saying streaming viewership for the 2023 Super Bowl was 21.8 million, which is inaccurate.
