        <p>The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. [1]

Notably, once the Super Bowl champion is determined, the trophy is sent back to Tiffany &amp; Co. for engraving before being delivered to the winning team to keep. All that said, understanding the making behind the Super Bowl trophy definitely adds to the allure of the award, especially considering the effort and detailing that goes into it.

Tiffany has produced the coveted 22-inch, 8.75-pound trophy since the first Super Bowl in 1967. In 1970, the trophy was renamed for Vince Lombardi, the late Green Bay Packers coach who led the Packers to victory in the first two Super Bowls. The trophy was initially designed by Oscar Riedener, a former Vice President at Tiffany &amp; Co., who  
The Lombardi Trophy is awarded annually to the winner of the Super Bowl, crowning that team as the NFL champion. It was first presented to the Green Bay Packers on Jan. 15, 1967, at the conclusion  
First designed and handcrafted by Tiffany &amp; Co. for the inaugural Super Bowl ® I in 1967, the Vince Lombardi Trophy symbolizes the pinnacle of gridiron glory. Three years after it was introduced, in 1970, the trophy was renamed after the late Green Bay Packers coach, Lombardi, who led the Packers to victory in the first two Super Bowls.

This is not a case of engraving a super bowl final onto a finished trophy. Unlike the real Lombardi the engraving/etching is almost the very first step in the process!
