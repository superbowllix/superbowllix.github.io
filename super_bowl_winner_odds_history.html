        <h2><strong>super bowl winner odds history super bowl quarterback winners by year</strong></h2>
        <p>For this yearâ€™s Super Bowl, the Kansas City Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites over the Philadelphia Eagles with a posted total of 48.5 points. The odds on the Super Bowl have been known to change, and thereâ€™s still a few days until the game. 
Super Bowl History For Spread And Totals Betting. Historical data shows that Super Bowl winners almost always cover the spread. A comprehensive look at past winners reveals this trend to be a constant, as the eventual winner has covered the spread in nine of the last 10 games, and 17 of the past 20. 
The team favored to win the Super Bowl has a 37-21 record straight up. However, underdogs have won six of the last ten Super Bowls now. Favorites no longer have an edge when it comes to covering the spread in the Super Bowl, though. The team favored to win the Super Bowl is 28-28-2 against the spread. 
The most infamous finale in Super Bowl history for oddsmakers was Super Bowl XIII and a lesson learned for all individuals standing behind the betting counter. The 13th installment saw the Steelers open as 4.5-point favorites over the Cowboys and the number dropped to 3.5 -points with early action on the Cowboys. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
The Chiefs opened with +750 odds to win the 2025 Super Bowl. That means a $100 bet at those odds would return $750 in profit, or a $10 bet would return $75 in profit. 
After the Rams win in SB 56, the NFC now has a two-win edge with a 29-27 straight-up record. The ATS numbers are similar with the NFC having a 28-26-2 mark and the AFC of course would have a 26-28-2 record against the spread.

The following provides a detailed analysis of every Super Bowl spread and total (if available) since the inaugural Super Bowl in 1967 through 2023. The score and winner of each game, including the ATS (against the spread) winner and over/under result, have been listed. At a basic level, there are no significant outlying trends.

The Kansas City Chiefs captured Super Bowl 58 and the team is listed as a +650 betting choice (Bet $100 to win $650) to three-peat in 2025. Here were the opening odds for which NFL team will win Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans later in 2025. 
The San Francisco 49ers are Super Bowl favorites at +300. The Kansas City Chiefs have the second-shortest odds at +500. The Chiefs are seeking to become the first back-to-back champion since the New England Patriots in Super Bowls XXXVII (February 2004) and XXXVIII (February 2005). 
Super Bowl Gatorade Color History We have the history of the color of the Gatorade poured on the winning coach dating back to Super Bowl 35 and there's a reason purple is the favorite at +210.

So, in terms of Super Bowl odds 2023-2024, bettors should look at the Super Bowl favorites instead of long-shot Super Bowl odds. ðŸŽ‰ What happened in last yearâ€™s Super Bowl? The Super Bowl 58 odds opened with the Kansas City Chiefs as a -2.5 favorite over the San Francisco 49ers. </p>
