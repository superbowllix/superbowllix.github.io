Super Bowl 58 became just the second in NFL history to go to overtime, and it provided fans with a thrilling conclusion. The 49ers got the ball first after winning the coin toss. 
LAS VEGAS â€” The overtime coin flip came up tails, and San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan faced a decision never before made in Super Bowl history.. The NFLâ€™s new playoff rule called for  
The 49ersâ€™ loss came in just the second overtime Super Bowl period in NFL history. Before San Francisco gave up a game-winning touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Mecole Hardman, head coach  
Just four years ago, Mahomes led the Chiefs to two touchdowns in the final seven minutes to erase a 10-point deficit and beat the 49ers for his first Super Bowl win. 
ESPN's Dan Orlovsky seems to believe the 49ers made a potentially game-altering mistake to begin the overtime period in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday.. San Francisco, who won the toss and elected to  
There was nothing that happened in overtime to suggest the 49ers' unfamiliarity with the NFL's overtime process had any significance. It was just another interesting footnote from the longest Super Bowl ever played -- one that spanned 74 minutes, 57 seconds of game action. 
The 49ers made some critical mistakes and failed to take advantage of numerous opportunities to take control. They left Patrick Mahomes with enough of an opening for him to make the big plays when needed for a 25-22 overtime victory in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday at Allegiant Stadium. 
Patrick Mahomes and Fred Warner met at the NFL shield at the 50-yard line of Allegiant Stadium for the overtime coin toss of Super Bowl LVIII knowing exactly what they were each supposed to elect  
Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 on Sunday, becoming the NFLâ€™s ninth repeat Super Bowl champs.

They lost Super Bowl 58 to the Kansas City Chiefs 25-22 on Sunday in only the second overtime game in Super Bowl history. The 49ers dominated the regular season so much they had a league-high nine  
The Kansas City Chiefs are officially back-to-back Super Bowl Champions. After a hard-fought game that stretched into overtime, the Chiefs claimed another Lombardi Trophy by a score of 25 to 22  
The next possession resulted in the first major mistake of the game for the Chiefs as the 49ers continued to stand out on defense. On the fourth play of the possession, Mahomes fired a pass deep  
Why the 49ers Elected To Receive the Ball First in Super Bowl Overtime. The NFL changed its playoff overtime regulation after the 2021-22 postseason â€” because of Mahomes. 
Football fans noticed something fishy about the Kansas City Chiefsâ€™ game-tying drive against the San Francisco 49ers at the end of regulation in Super Bowl 58. 
Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, becoming the first repeat Super  
San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan defended his decision to receive the ball first in overtime following Sunday's 25-22 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII. 
Although the Kansas City Chiefs have been praised for winning Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, the San Francisco 49ers have been almost equally blamed for a critical mistake they made in the loss
