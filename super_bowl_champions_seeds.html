        <h2><strong>super bowl champions seeds katy perry final super bowl</strong></h2>
        <p>The #2 seed has also done well in the Super Bowl, with the AFC's #2 seed winning six Super Bowls since 1975, and the NFC's #2 seed winning four Super Bowls. Funnily enough, the #4 seed has managed to win the Super Bowl seven times since 1975, with AFC teams accounting for four of these wins. #3, #5 and #6 seeds have all won the Super Bowl twice  
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season.

The last time the Eagles were the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, after the 2017 season, they advanced to Super Bowl 52. There they beat the AFC No. 1-seeded Patriots 41-33. 
The No. 3 seeds have a .500 record in the Super Bowl since 1975  24-21 in the wild-card round and the Detroit Lions 34-31 in the NFC Championship. Super Bowl LVIII will kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET  
Super Bowl 57 will mark another meeting between No. 1 seeds when the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles compete for the championship on Feb. 12. Though teams with the No. 1 seed in the playoffs in theory have the best shot at making it all the way, as they have earned a first-round bye as well as home-field advantage, top-seeds meeting  
Pittsburgh won 21-10 and head coach Bill Cowher and running back Jerome Bettis were able to retire as Super Bowl champions. The 2005 Steelers were the first team to win a Super Bowl as a No. 6 seed. 
1997 Denver Broncos, No. 4 seed: 31-24 over Packers in Super Bowl 32 2000 Baltimore Ravens, No. 4 seed: 34-7 over Giants in Super Bowl 35 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers, No. 6 seed: 21-10 over Seahawks  
• Since 2000, only two No. 1 seeds have won the Super Bowl -- the 2009 Saints and the 2003 Patriots. In that same span, four No. 2 seeds, one No. 3 seed, two No. 4 seeds, one No. 5 seed and two No. 6 seeds have won the Super Bowl. • In the first 12 years of the “home-field era” (post-1974), 10 No. 1 seeds won the Super Bowl. 
About three-quarters (32 of 42) of teams that made the Super Bowl got a bye (first or second seed) from 1999 to 2019 made the Super Bowl. This included 52% of teams that were the one seed and 24%  
The two-time defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs (15-2) and Detroit Lions (15-2) earned the right to sit back and watch things unfold before beginning their quest for the Vince  
The Chiefs’ defense is the biggest reason why the defending Super Bowl champions are the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Excluding the Week 18 shutout loss with no starters playing, Kansas City held  
This is a tremendous mountain for a #6 seed to climb, as they need to: 1) Win three straight road games to make it to the Super Bowl 2) Beat the #1 ranked team in the conference in the Divisional round 3) Win the conference Championship on the road (presumably against another excellent team) 4) Win the Super Bowl That is no easy feat. 
I'm going to go with the Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs have won Super Bowl fifty-seven Super Bowl set okay you have Kansas City Chiefs forty-niners I'm going to go with the San Francisco forty-niners the Chiefs beat both number one seeds of the postseason when they are the Super Bowl champions here we go alright very nice so here we go the  
The AFC and NFC champions will square off in Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, Feb. 9. Where is the Super Bowl 2025? Caesars Superdome, home of the New Orleans Saints, in the Big Easy will host the Big Game . 
How many rounds are there? The 2025 NFL postseason is structured and scheduled as follows: Wild-card round (6 games): Jan. 11-13 Divisional round (4 games): Jan. 18-19 Conference championship  
No rest for the weary indeed! This table spells out clearly why it‘s a tall task for those lower seeds to navigate the perilous path to the Super Bowl. And the history shows it with just two 6 seeds (2005 Steelers and 2010 Packers) winning the Super Bowl out of the 12 seed format. Making it to the big game as an underdog is achievement enough  
The road to Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans begins with a loaded Wild Card slate, one that features a little bit of everything. You’ve got rookie quarterbacks ( Jayden Daniels , Bo Nix ) in their first postseasons, one of the season’s best stories in the Vikings ( Sam Darnold ), and of course, bonafide star power courtesy of Josh Allen and  
If the Chiefs make the Super Bowl, the model says their worst matchup would be the Packers, who are the No. 7 seed in the AFC.Kansas City beats Green Bay in just 40.2% of simulations. 
It should be no surprise that ranking the NFL's four remaining teams is even harder than choosing where to order pizza for an upcoming Super Bowl party. The 49ers, Ravens, Lions and Chiefs each  </p>
