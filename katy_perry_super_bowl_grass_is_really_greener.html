"California Gurls," performed by Katy Perry (featuring Snoop Dogg), and appearing on her 2010 album entitled Teenage Dream, is an ingenious music-industry invention.Anyone that's ever imagined a (vaguely Italian) suit-wearing fat cat behind a desk with a cigar, puppeteering our music tastes and consumption through the clever manipulation of musical stereotypes, advertising, hype, and desire  
Embedded within the catchy beats and sugary chorus of Katy Perry's 'California Gurls,' there lies a textured narrative that reaches beyond the surface-level allure of a summer anthem.
