        <p>The 2025 Super Bowl, also known as Super Bowl LIX or Super Bowl 59, is set for 6:30 p.m. EST on Sunday, Feb. 9. The game will be played at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana . 
Super Bowl Sunday is the day on which the Super Bowl, the National Football League (NFL)'s annual championship game, is played.

Reasons for a Holiday: Food and Exhaustion. Super Bowl Sunday is already considered one of the biggest food consumption days in the US, second only to Thanksgiving. Fans consume 1.42 billion chicken wings, 11 million pounds of chips, and over 325 million gallons of beer, contributing to post-game exhaustion and sluggishness the next day.

The Super Bowl has gained unrivaled cultural relevance over the last 58 years, entering the exclusive, “unofficial holiday” category. Similar to actual holidays, like Thanksgiving, which falls on the fourth Thursday of November, every year, the Super Bowl falls on the second Sunday of February. 
The game is considered to be the pinnacle of American gridiron football. This year’s Super Bowl contest and celebration is a bit different, however, because it marks the 50th time it has been played since its inception in 1967.

People invariably think it's cool to have covered a Super Bowl and I suppose in some ways it is, but it's actually a journalistic nightmare. Too many writers competing for too few stories. Now, the Super Bowl wasn't always so super. There were only a dozen journalists at the first Super Bowl in 1967 between Green Bay and Kansas City.
