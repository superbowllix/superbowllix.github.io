        <p>It’s becoming a Super Bowl tradition: He Gets Us, the billion-dollar effort to overhaul the public image of Jesus, the Son of God, will be back on the airwaves during Super Bowl LIX. Greg Miller  
A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines. 
“He Gets Us,” the ad campaign centered around rebranding Jesus for the contemporary world, will be returning to the Super Bowl in 2025. Come Near, the non-profit that manages the “He Gets Us  
Super Bowl advertisers paid up to $8 million to secure a spot in television's most watched broadcast. Here's a lineup by product category of the commercials that will run. 
The ad will explore “how Jesus redefined true greatness.” Lerma, the lead creative agency behind He Gets Us’ previous Super Bowl spots, created the 2025 ad as well. 
For many viewers of the Super Bowl, one ad amid the beer and tax-software and car commercials may be particularly surprising. It might look something like this: A guitar strums a melancholy tune. 
A group called He Gets Us ran two ads during the Super Bowl game on Sunday to spread the word about Jesus. One of the donors behind the ads is a craft chain billionaire worth nearly $15 billion. 
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Who Is My Neighbor,” the 15-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” 
Green discussed his involvement in the campaign, and the Super Bowl ad spots, during a November 2022 interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck. “We are wanting to say — ‘we  
The ad will cost The Signatry $20 million to air in the Super Bowl, and they hope to reach more than 100 million people with their commercial. View this post on Instagram A post shared by He Gets  
The Super Bowl is one of the most-watched television events in the United States, with millions of viewers tuning in each year to watch the big game and the highly-anticipated commercials that air during breaks. One commercial that caught the attention of many viewers during the 2022 Super Bowl was the Jesus commercial, which featured an actor portraying Jesus Christ in various modern-day  
“Foot Washing," a 60-second commercial from He Gets Us, debuted at last year's Super Bowl. “He Gets Us,” the effort to connect with consumers in the name of Jesus, will be back for a third  
The Super Bowl is not only one of the biggest sporting events of the year, but also one of the most anticipated events for advertisers. Every year, companies spend millions of dollars to air commercials during the game in hopes of reaching a massive audience. In recent years, we have seen a trend of celebrities appearing in these commercials to grab viewers’ attention. One such celebrity who  
In conclusion, the “Jesus” commercial during the Super Bowl was funded by billionaire entrepreneur John Smith. With a net worth of over $1 billion, John Smith is known for his successful business ventures, philanthropic efforts, and dedication to making a positive impact on the world. 
As the final countdown to Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, begins, it’s clear that Matthew McConaughey stars in Uber Eats Super Bowl Ad 2025 with a mission: to tickle our funny bones while encouraging us to get even hungrier—and, of course, order from the Uber Eats app when cravings strike. 
The Super Bowl is the highest-rated televisual event in the United States and it represents the No. 1 piece of advertising real estate for brands across the country. Every year it seems like the  
Jesus, Snoop and Tom . While the Saints did not make the New Orleans Super Bowl, Jesus did. “He Gets Us,” the campaign centered around rebranding Jesus for the contemporary world, is returning

With Super Bowl LIX set for February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, the excitement is building. This year, brands are spending up to $7 million for just 30 seconds of airtime. That’s a huge amount of money, but the Super Bowl gives advertisers a chance to reach millions of viewers worldwide. 
He Gets Us also aired an ad at last year's Super Bowl, where it was funded by the Kansas-based charity the Servant Foundation, which itself is a financial backer of Alliance Defending Freedom. ADF  </p>
