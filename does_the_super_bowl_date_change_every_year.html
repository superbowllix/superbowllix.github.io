        <h2><strong>does the super bowl date change every year super bowl time over</strong></h2>
        <p>The NFL had an unbroken streak of January Super Bowl dates from Super Bowl I in 1967 to Super Bowl XXXV in 2001. Later that year, the terrorist attacks on September 11 threw the world into disarray. 
The Super Bowl has been the final game of the NFL season since 1966, in the sport's post-merger era, but has not always been a fixture in the second month of the year. For the best part of four decades, it was held in January, initially in the first few weeks until 1978, and then in the latter stages of the month between 1979 and 2003. 
Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar Bowl), and El Paso (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton Bowl) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term "bowl" for any major American football game was well  
Every year, Super Bowl fans gather on a Sunday in February to watch the biggest game of the season. Many have wondered- why not Saturday?  Super Bowl LVII drew a record-breaking 115 million  
Super Bowl Sunday is the day on which the Super Bowl, the National Football League (NFL)'s annual championship game, is played. It was the first Sunday in February from Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 until Super Bowl LV in 2021, but is now the second Sunday, beginning with Super Bowl LVI . 
This isn't the first time the date for the Super Bowl has changed. Super Bowl I happened on January 15, 1967, and January continued to be the go-to Super Bowl month for the next 34 years. 
How late does the Super Bowl go? A. As the Super Bowl usually lasts for 3 hours and 30 minutes on average, a Super Bowl starting at 6:30 p.m. ET will end between 10:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. 
Super Bowl 2023 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles is scheduled to be played on Sunday, February 12. However, the date of the game being played this year is later than usual. 
The Super Bowl has topped television ratings in the United States every year since the first championship game in 1967. This has made commercial time during its broadcast the most expensive of any televised event in the United States. In 2016, for example, a 30-second spot cost approximately $4.8 million. 
Super Bowl XXXVI: New England Patriots 20, St. Louis Rams 17 Super Bowl XLVII: Baltimore Ravens 34, San Francisco 49ers 31 The league announced in September that 17-time Grammy winner Kendrick  
Unlike the Super Bowl, the NFL Pro Bowl does not change locations every year. For a game that has changed formats so many times throughout its history, at least the locations have remained somewhat stable. Here is a list of all the Pro Bowl locations by year. 
Although the Super Bowl has had different fixed dates over the years, since 2004 the game had always been on the first Sunday in February. Starting in 2022 it will be held on the second Sunday  
This year's Super Bowl featured the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers on Feb. 11, 2024. The 49ers are making their eighth Super Bowl appearance; the Chiefs a sixth. The Chiefs won in  
What time is the 2025 Super Bowl? Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET.  Last year, Super Bowl 58 was between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, with the Chiefs winning 25-22. 
The Super Bowl 59 will take place at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. This will be the eighth Super Bowl held in the Superdome and the 11th in New Orleans. The last time the city hosted the Super Bowl was in 2013 (Super Bowl XLVII). What time does the Super Bowl start? Super Bowl LIX will start at 6:30 PM ET. 
Best Super Bowl commercial every year since 2000: Looking back on the best ads of the last 25 years  Considering how expensive it is to purchase air time during the Super Bowl -- a 30-second  
As the most-watched TV broadcast each year, the Super Bowl offers the most coveted and expensive advertising slots on television. And every year, more brands want in than can take the field. 
What time does Super Bowl 59 start in 2025? Kickoff for Super Bowl LIX is slated for 6:30 p.m. ET.  Super Bowl halftime show:Every performer by year as Kendrick Lamar is tapped for 2025.

Just as you find yourself every NFL postseason wondering how the Patriots are in another Super Bowl, every year you find yourself wondering how a particular city is chosen to host the Super Bowl  </p>
