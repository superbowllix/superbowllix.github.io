        <p>The game marked the first Super Bowl in which both of the teams had appeared, but had not yet lost a previous Super Bowl; the 49ers came into the game having won all five of their previous Super Bowl appearances, while the Ravens had won in their lone previous Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season.

Super Bowl XLVII (meaning Super Bowl 47 in Roman numerals) was a Super Bowl game in which the Baltimore Ravens, winners of the American Football Conference (AFC) for the 2012 season, beat the San Francisco 49ers, winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) for the 2012 season, 34–31 to become winners of National Football League (NFL) for the 2012 season. 
On Feb. 3, 2013, the AFC Champion Ravens battled the NFC Champion 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. It was the first time in NFL history that two brothers, John and Jim Harbaugh, faced each other as head

After a season full of trials, the Ravens overcome once again to beat the San Francisco 49ers, 34-31, in Super Bowl XLVII and claim the franchise's second Lombardi Trophy. The Ravens made a goal  
The Ravens won their second Super Bowl (recount the Ravens first Super Bowl here), making them one of only two teams as of 2023 to go to multiple Super Bowls and win all of them. The other one will come up in a few months on this podcast, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Super Bowl XLVII wasn’t special because the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers were the greatest teams in the league, nor is it a game remembered for its wildly surprising outcome. The 47th Super Bowl grabbed national attention because both squads’ head coaches were brothers — Jim and John Harbaugh — and an unexpected 34-minute []
