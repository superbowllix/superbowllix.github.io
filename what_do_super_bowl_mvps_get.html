In one of the higher-scoring Super Bowls of all-time, Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 38-35 victory en route to his second Super Bowl and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player. Mahomes threw three touchdowns, including two in the fourth quarter while playing on an injured ankle, to lift the Chiefs from a 10-point halftime deficit. 
The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game.

When the Most Valuable Player (MVP) opts out of attending an award ceremony, another player from the  
Being the Super Bowl MVP is a monumental honor, but what this player really receives is more than just glory. A physical trophy, a trip, and even million-dollar contracts await the chosen one

Linebacker: 4. Defensive end: 2. Safety: 2. Cornerback: 1. Defensive tackle: 1. Returner: 1. List of Super Bowl MVPs. Super Bowl I: QB Bart Starr, Green
