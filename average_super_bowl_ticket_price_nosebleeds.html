        <h2><strong>average super bowl ticket price nosebleeds super bowl gambling predictions</strong></h2>
        <p>This year's Super Bowl tickets are at lower prices compared to the same point as last year, according to TickPick. The average ticket price is $6,645, per TickPick, significantly less than last year. 
Fans are getting to enjoy the first-ever Super Bowl played in Las Vegas. Forecast to be a great game, the 2024 Super Bowl ticket prices are hitting and passing all-time highs. For the game set to be played on Sunday, February 11th at the Raiders’ home field, Allegiant Stadium, the average price of a ticket has hit $9,500 USD. 
Super Bowl Ticket Face Value. For Super Bowl 2025, the face value is $950 for the cheapest Super Bowl tickets in the stadium for “nose bleeds” in the upper end zone, and among the most expensive Super Bowl tickets are going for $7,500 for premium seats near the 50-yard line in the 100-level sections. 
There, when you add up fees to the price of a ticket, you'd be paying $5,762 for a seat. If the nose bleeds aren't your speed, all three sites have tickets in the lower bowls of the Superdome  
T icket prices for the Super Bowl are higher than usual, up 38% from last year’s prices, according to SeatGeek data shared with TIME.. The current get-in price, or cheapest ticket, is listed at  
StubHub told CBS News last week that the average price for a Super Bowl ticket was $8,600. Ticketmaster, which serves as the NFL's official ticket platform, showed the lowest price for tickets  
The most affordable tickets in the nosebleeds are tagged at $6,609 on SeatGeek, but that's just the entry point; there are tickets selling for as high as $62,999. Flights aren't cheap, either. 
According to sales data from TickPick, here’s how the lowest ticket prices for the Super Bowl have trended in recent years: 2024 (49ers vs. Chiefs): $8,778; 2023 (Eagles vs. Chiefs): $5,271; 
Here's a complete guide to Chiefs vs. 49ers Super Bowl ticket prices in 2024, including the latest information on cheapest and most expensive seats inside Allegiant Stadium to watch Super Bowl 58. 
The average price for the Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles game at TickPick was $6,552 as of Tuesday. If that amount holds, it would be that website’s third highest for a Super Bowl. Last year’s game between the Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers had an average price at that site of $9,136. 
According to TicketSmarter via the K.C. Business Journal, the average price of a ticket to Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans is running at $7,233. That is "down from an average" of $12,121 for last year’s Super Bowl LVIII, the first held in Las Vegas and the "most expensive ever." 
JAWDROPPING Super Bowl ticket prices see nosebleed seats go on sale for $180,000 as the biggest football event of the year approaches. The Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams will face off  
The average price of a Super Bowl ticket was $8,076 in the final weeks leading up to this year's game, CBS Sports reported, citing StubHub. How much are the most expensive Super Bowl tickets for 2025? 
Super Bowl 59 ticket prices. While the average price of the game is higher than the cheapest ticket, it still costs more than $5,000 to get into Caesars Superdome. 
For example, the cheapest ticket for last year's 49ers vs Chiefs game in the nosebleeds averaged around $7,800. As for this year? It'll cost you less than $4,000 to get into the Caesars Superdome, but you may want to wait - with every passing day the price gets lower and lower. So why the big drop in Super Bowl prices? 
How does the cost of a 2025 Super Bowl ticket compare to previous years? Although StubHub said it’s seeing record demand for Super Bowl tickets in 2025, with sales up 10% from the same time last year, the company’s average price for a seat at the game is down 14% since 2024, according to CBS Sports. 
To put that into perspective, the average price of a single Super Bowl ticket this time one year ago was about $11,000, according to the online ticket marketplace TickPick. Are fans losing interest? While ticket prices for Super Bowl LIX remain steep, they reflect a broader trend of price stabilization after admission to the big game hit near  
The Price of Entry: Super Bowl 59 Ticket Prices. If you thought a regular-season Eagles game was expensive, brace yourself. Current average ticket prices: Lower-level seats: $8,000+ per ticket. Mid-level seats: $6,000. Nosebleeds (but you're still there): $5,000. And if you're looking for VIP treatment? Expect to pay upwards of $15,000+ per seat. 
Not sure about Super Bowl, but I went to the World Series last year. Ticket was $550, and ticketmaster fee was $11. So compared to ticket value, not bad at all. Where it really feels like bullshit is during the regular season when tickets are like $15 and you also have to pay $11 fee 
StubHub cited an average ticket price of $8,076 for Super Bowl LIX, a 14 percent decline from Super Bowl LVIII (h/t USA Today's Jordan Mendoza). Still, it costs an arm and a leg to witness Hurts  </p>
