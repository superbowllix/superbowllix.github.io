        <h2><strong>super bowl winning qb percentage of cap usher super bowl meme gif</strong></h2>
        <p>The median cap percentage for a QB to win the Super Bowl is 10%. In the past 10 Super Bowls, 5 of the winning QBs represents less than 10% of the cap (with Nick Foles at 0.96% being the outlier), and 5 were above 10% (all named Brady or Manning). 
So in 20 years no Super Bowl winning team has invested a higher percentage of their cap on a QB than the first team to ever win one in the cap era. Yet teams continue to pour more and more money into that position each season. Since Young’s championship in 1994, only three other quarterbacks have eaten up 10% of their teams salary cap- Eli  
The vast majority of Super Bowl-winning starters since 1994, however, own cap hits that take up between 10.6% and 12.3% of their respective team's entire salary cap, per Thompson. (Market-leading  
On the flip side, no QB with a cap percentage over 13.1% had ever won a Super Bowl – until this past season. Mahomes’ cap hit was a massive 17.16% of the team total, way more than the 13.1% of Steve Young in the very first year of the cap (under a contract that was signed before a cap existed). 
The average cap % for the last 5 Super Bowl winning QBs: 7.8%; The average cap % for the last 5 Super Bowl losing QBs: 6.1%; This Super Bowl projects to be the first since 2016 (Brady/Ryan) where at least one of the starting QBs does not sign a contract extension in the following offseason. 
The highest cap hit for a Super Bowl-winning quarterback since the turn of the century came in 2020 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers prevailed with Tom Brady playing under a cap number of $25 million, which amounted to 12.61 percent of their cap. 
If such is dominated by quarterbacks in the 6-10% range, with very few outliers over 11%, then the alleged "proven model" may actually be the worst for winning the Super Bowl, with highly-paid  
The oldest team in the NFL has never won a Super Bowl and only been there once. They have 2 pre-Super Bowl Championships, but one is protested by historians. They had a 51-year playoff win drought. Yet they aren't even usually mentioned among "most cursed franchises". 
The team came in at a whopping 11.1% dead cap space, bringing the total up to 15.61%. That means the better way to look at it is that the Eagles had 84.39% of cap space available for all non-QB positions. So, how much cap space was available for non-QB positions on other recent Super Bowl winning teams? 2020 Buccaneers - 81.03% 
Those shares put the future Hall of Famer in some noteworthy company considering that no starting quarterback ever won a title while taking up more than 13.1 percent of his club’s salary cap  
That’s the second-lowest percentage of the salary cap any Super Bowl-winning quarterback has accounted for other than Brady in his second season in 2001, when he took up 0.47% of the Patriots  
The Super Bowl winning QB never had a salary that was more than 12.2% of his team’s cap (Brady was at that percentage twice). For 2022, that would translate to roughly a $26M cap hit.

So, how much cap space was available for non-QB positions on other recent Super Bowl winning teams? 2020 Buccaneers - 81.03% 
Here is the annual salary estimates presented as a percentage of the salary cap for the Super Bowl winning QBs from 2000-2012. For the uncapped year I assumed a cap of $129 million which was the expected number based on cap growth in the prior CBA. 
With the Kansas City Chiefs winning the 2022 Super Bowl. Taking up 17.19% of the salary cap, Patrick Mahomes has the highest percentage of cap hit for a QB winning the Super Bowl since 2001. The average cap hit percentage for a Super Bowl winning QB since 01: 7.86% 
One stat that stands above the rest is the percentage of cap space used by QBs and Super Bowl wins. The highest paid Super Bowl winning QB was Tom Brady in 2020. His cap hit was $28 million, or just over 14% of the cap. Some would say that is an outlier because a lot of veterans took pay cuts to join the Bucs and chase a ring. 
Let’s examine the last 10 Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. (Due to the Eagles’ unique situation in 2017, the cap hits of Nick Foles and Carson Wentz were combined for this exercise.) Super  
In 2023, the Chiefs reached the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, securing Mahomes his second Lombardi Trophy. Currently positioned as the primary contender to Tom Brady’s seven titles, Mahomes has an opportunity to win his third Super Bowl on February 11, 2024, when the Chiefs take on San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII. 
Bill Musgrave has the highest career completion percentage by a quarterback in Super Bowls, at 100.0 percent.  Super Bowl. 1. 22. 25. 268. 10.7. 268.0. 3  
Since the implementation of the salary cap before the 1994 season, Steven Ruiz points out that only four quarterbacks have won a Super Bowl while accounting for more than 11% of the cap. </p>
