The NFL said that last year's Super Bowl drew in 62.5 million global viewers, which was a 10 percent increase from the year prior. Mexico and Canada combined for over 42 million viewers, but  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
That’s 2.1 million more than the 113 million viewers initially reported after the game, making it the most-watched Super Bowl of all time, topping the 114.4 million viewers who watched New

Michael Jackson's Super Bowl performance changed the way we watched the halftime show forever. Before MJ, the halftime show featured outdated marching bands and drill teams - but after 1993 that had all changed. 
The performance was successful in its goals, causing viewership of the Super Bowl to increase between halves for the first time in the game's history. With an audience of 133.4 million viewers in the United States [1] and 1.3 billion viewers worldwide, it is estimated to be one of the most watched television broadcasts of all time. 
Every Super Bowl Sunday, millions gather not just for the game but for the commercials—mini-masterpieces that blend humor, storytelling, and branding into a few unforgettable seconds. Some ads make us laugh, some make us think, and a rare few become pop culture landmarks. What makes a Super Bowl ad truly great?
