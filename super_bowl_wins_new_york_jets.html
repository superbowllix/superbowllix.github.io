        <p>The New York Jets are one of the oldest teams in the NFL and play in the AFC East Division. Unlike their counterparts the New York Giants, the Jets have a comparatively bleak Super Bowl history  
The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three titles in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super Bowl titles. The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX, LI, and LIII for three titles in five seasons. They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season

The New York Jets last won the Super Bowl in the 1968 season. The Jets beat the Baltimore Colts 16-7 in the Super Bowl. When was the last time the New York Jets lost the Super Bowl? The New York Jets have never lost a Super Bowl. 
As heavy underdogs at Super Bowl III, the Jets represented the AFL with distinction as they defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts. The Jets became the first AFL team to defeat an NFL team in their combined championship game. When was the last New York Jets Super Bowl win? As noted, the Jets have been in just one Super Bowl, which they won in 1969. 
However, the Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl, making them one of two NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance along with the New Orleans Saints, and one of five teams never to win a conference championship since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, along with the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and two expansion franchises, the

Super Bowl III was an American football championship game played on January 12, 1969, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.It was the third AFL–NFL Championship Game in professional American football, and the first to officially bear the trademark name "Super Bowl". [3] 
It’s January 12th, 1969 at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida; three days after Joe Namath’s guarantee that the New York Jets will win the Super Bowl. A whistle blows and the New York Jets line up on the the Baltimore Colts’ four yard line. The stadium seems to grow quiet, as Joe looks up and down the line, then calls for the snap. 
Days earlier, Jets quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed a victory by New York, an 18-point underdog. The win was the first in the Super Bowl for the AFL, which merged with the NFL for the 1970 season.

The Packers would also win Super Bowl II, and in 1970, the NFL would rename the “World Professional Football Championship Trophy” to the Vince Lombardi Trophy.  New York Jets 16, Baltimore  
The New York Jets, led by quarterback Joe Namath, rocked the sports world and the country on Jan. 12, 1969, by becoming the first American Football League team to defeat an NFL team with their 16-7 Super Bowl III victory over the heavily favored Baltimore Colts at Miami's Orange Bowl. 
Going into Super Bowl III Against the Baltimore Colts, Joe Namath Made a Guarantee: His Jets Would Pull off the Greatest Upset in the History of Football  
January 12, 1969, was the chance for two fresh faces — the New York Jets of the AFL and the Baltimore Colts of the NFL — to grace the big stage for the first time and make or break the NFL’s unbroken win streak at the Super Bowl. 
The Jets were the first AFL team to win the Super Bowl when they upset the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, 16-7. The result was one of the reasons why the AFL and NFL merged. It has been 54 years since the Jets hoisted the championship trophy, and while they have been close to returning to the Super Bowl, the Jets have fallen short. 
As good as New York played, Buffalo still had a chance to pull off the win, but Norwood's 47-yard field goal went wide right and gave New York their second Super Bowl win. 3. Joe Namath Guarantees  </p>
