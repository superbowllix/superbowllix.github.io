        <p>Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320  
Washington won 42-10, and Williams was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to start in and win any NFL championship game, including those before the Super Bowl was established. 
The Super Bowl is the grandest stage in football, and throughout its history, only a handful of Black quarterbacks have started in the big game. From Doug Williams breaking barriers in the 1980s  
The upstart Eagles star was right: Only seven other Black quarterbacks have taken the Super Bowl stage as starters since the big game's inception at the end of the 1966 season. 
Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was the seventh black quarterback to start a Super Bowl. [30] The combined Super Bowl records of black quarterbacks is 5–7. Williams and Mahomes are to date the only players to win the Super Bowl MVP award. [31] 
But racist assumptions kept Black players from the starting quarterback position for nearly another two decades. Doug Williams became the first quarterback to start in – and win – a Super Bowl in 1988. It was not until 2017 that all 32 NFL teams had started at least one Black quarterback. 
It would be another 26 years before another starting Black quarterback won a Super Bowl game. In the title game following the 2013 season, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson dominated Super Bowl 48 against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, leading his team to a 43-8 win to become the world champions. The 26-year-old QB completed  
Williams, who led Washington to a 42-10 Super Bowl victory over Denver in 1988, knew that for the first time in NFL history, two Black quarterbacks would be starting in the title game. 
There's Marlin Briscoe, the first Black player in the Super Bowl era to start a game at quarterback. The Denver Broncos wanted to convert him to cornerback, but soon the team's white quarterback  
Black quarterbacks led both teams in Sunday’s Super Bowl. But for much of pro football history, Black players were steered away from the position because of racist assumptions. 
For the first time in history, two Black quarterbacks will face off in a game which will decide the championship of a professional football league — in the U.S., that is.. The outcome of Super  
The first time around when these two met in the Super Bowl, the headline was about history. It was the first time that two Black quarterbacks would play against one another as starters in the big  
Two Black quarterbacks in the Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and the Eagles' Jalen Hurts isn’t a story line for Super Bowl LIX, and that’s a beautiful act of resistance and acceptance. 
Washington won 42-10, and Williams was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to start in and win any NFL championship game, including those before the Super Bowl was established. 
For 27-year-old Chiefs quarterback Mahomes – who is looking for his second Super Bowl ring when the two teams face off in Arizona on February 12, which would make him the first Black quarterback  
Only three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl — Mahomes, Williams and Russell Wilson. In 1969, James "Shack" Harris became the first Black QB to start a season-opener in the NFL — 15  
Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320

There was also Doug Williams, who led Washington past the Broncos in 1988 to become the first black quarterback to win the Super Bowl. These athletes excel as black QBs in the NFL. The reputations of black quarterbacks in the NFL are marked by groundbreaking careers and incredible athleticism.
