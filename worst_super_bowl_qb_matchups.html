The first 43 Super Bowls have featured some of the greatest quarterbacks ever to play the game. Super Bowl XLIV on Sunday, with Peyton Manning and Drew Brees, looks to be no exception 
The Ravens promptly cut him the very next season. He is still widely regarded as the worst QB to ever win a Super Bowl. Pictured here, two well-deserving Super Bowl champs.

But the worst quarterback performance ever in a Super Bowl belongs to Craig Morton of the Denver Broncos. At Super Bowl XII in 1978, Morton completed just four passes for a total of only 39 yards. In fact, he completed just as many passes to the opposition as to his own team, throwing four interceptions against a legendary Dallas Cowboys Defense.
