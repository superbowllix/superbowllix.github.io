        <p>Alicia Keys being there made perfect sense. She and Usher collabed on “My Boo” in 2004 and it was a hit. Usher was long retired before she got to the scene. No. Alicia Keys’ first album was released in 2001, same year as Usher’s 8701. Usher was well established but hardly retired. He hadn’t even released Confessions yet. Cee Lo in glasses 
Usher had a key piece of advice for fellow artist Kendrick Lamar, who is set to perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show this 2025.. While NFL fans eagerly await the showdown between the Kansas  
Usher shared his advice for 2025 Super Bowl halftime performer Kendrick Lamar during an appearance on 'The Jennifer Hudson Show' in an episode airing Tuesday, Feb 4, ahead of Sunday's big game. 
February 4, 2025. After making history at the Grammys, Kendrick Lamar is getting ready to further pad his resume with his upcoming Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher,

Usher didn’t sugarcoat his advice to Kendrick Lamar, who's set to headline the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show. During The Jennifer Hudson Show , Usher, who took the same stage last year, spoke  
Usher has been making hits since he was 14 years old in the early 90s and has mentored so many other artists, and is largely credited for the success of Justin Bieber. Haters stay mad, but I’m looking forward to this one! 
I’d like to think that Billy Joel’s recent release is him prepping for a 2025 performance. If any older act could excite across all ages like in the past, it’s Mr. Piano Man himself. Go to a concert of his and you’ll see people of all ages, largely multiple generations together singing along. 
After Usher electrified Allegiant Stadium on Sunday (Feb. 11) at the 2024 Super Bowl with his dazzling footwork and surprise guests such as Alicia Keys, H.E.R., Ludacris and more. 
In Screen Gab No. 166, Usher drops in to discuss his new Audible Original, we catch up with Netflix's 'The Night Agent' and more. Usher's Super Bowl halftime show advice for Kendrick Lamar - Los

Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money. 
Or it can be a rapper coalition like the Dre Super Bowl because Lil Wayne is a Louisiana native. Could do a young money thing with drake and nicki Minaj but they are not in good graces with the public lately so I think it’s unlikely. Jay-Z also has hits but he has more of an NY connection. They could also do a country artist as well for a change. 
In a few years, I can see Doja Cat crushing the Super Bowl. She's already a good live performer, just needs more time to build her catalog. I know they offered Adele the position a few years ago and that would be a fascinating show to see at the Super Bowl. 
For those that don’t have Apple Music there’s a trial for 3 months for free for the Usher Super-Bowl DISCUSSION Use this to listen to the album since it’s not on Spotify yet. 
“It’s an honor of a lifetime to finally check a Super Bowl performance off my bucket list. I can’t wait to bring the world a show unlike anything else they’ve seen from me before,” Usher said in a statement. “Thank you to the fans and everyone who made this opportunity happen. I’ll see you real soon.” 
TN: How valuable is a Super Bowl halftime performance for older artists, like Usher, Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre? SL: When you think about why those artists do the Super Bowl, like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Mary J. Blige in 2022, they didn’t necessarily have a huge hit at the time. But they are hip-hop pioneers, and they go out there [on stage  
The Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show takes place on Sunday, February 12, 2023, and despite rumors, Taylor Swift will not be performing at the Arizona event, TMZ and People report. According to TMZ, Swift was asked to perform at the NFL’s show, but declined the opportunity so that she can continue the process of re-recording her back  
It wasn’t terrible (a la The Weeknd and Maroon 5’s shows), but it wasn’t as good as Rihanna’s (2023) or the Hip-Hop Halftime show (2022). </p>
