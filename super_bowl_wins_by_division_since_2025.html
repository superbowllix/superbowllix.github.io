Mahomes could win his fourth Super Bowl, tying Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the second-most among starting quarterbacks.In honor of Mahomes, here are 15 big questions for Super Bowl 59.1. 
Have the Vikings Ever Won the Super Bowl? No. The Minnesota Vikings have never won the Super Bowl. The Vikings have reached the Super Bowl a total of four times (1970, 1974, 1975, and 1977) but have never won. They are one of two teams in NFL history that have reached the Super Bowl four times without a win. The other is the Buffalo Bills. 
(Stafford led the Rams to a Super Bowl win over the Bengals. Photo: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) The Rams have won two Super Bowls in franchise history. They won Super Bowl XXXIV 23-16 over the Titans when they were the St. Louis Rams. After moving back to Los Angeles, they won Super Bowl LVI against the Bengals 23-20. 
In 1971, the Indianapolis Colts snagged their first Super Bowl win, defeating the Cowboys 16-13, and 35 years later they won in Super Bowl XLI, where they defeated the Chicago Bears 29-17.

Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money. 
The Miami Dolphins will watch today as a bitter division rival plays for a spot in the 2025 Super Bowl. The five-time reigning AFC East champion Buffalo Bills are one of four teams still alive for the NFL championship game, and they're the only one that has yet to win the Lombardi Trophy .
