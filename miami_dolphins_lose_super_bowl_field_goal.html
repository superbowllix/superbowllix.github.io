The Baltimore Ravens found themselves unlikely saviors for the Miami Dolphins, helping them from going winless. The Ravens were sunk in overtime on a missed 44-yard field goal from Matt Stover. 
In that season’s Super Bowl, the Dolphins fell short against the Cowboys, 24–3, Yepremian’s field goal marking Miami’s only points. The 1972 Dolphins were built in their coach’s image  
In the 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, a key plot point involves a kicker for the Miami Dolphins named Ray Finkle; in the story, Finkle misses a field goal attempt in the closing moments of Super Bowl XVII, causing the Dolphins to lose the game by a single point–an obvious reference to Norwood's infamous kick in Super Bowl XXV. 
The Miami Dolphins nearly capped a 17-0 perfect season with a 17-0 victory in Super Bowl VII, then Garo Yepremian tried a field goal.  Shula’s Baltimore Colts lost Super Bowl III, 16-7, to  
The Miami Dolphins have lost Super Bowl 17 in 1983 due to a missed field goal by fictional kicker Ray Finkle, which was held incorrectly by quarterback Dan Marino, who was still in college in

Sunday in Gillette Stadium, Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard game-tying field goal that would have sent the Baltimore Ravens and New England Patriots to overtime, where the winner earned a spot in  
It’s interesting to note that the Washington Redskins came close to dethroning the Miami Dolphins, but Garo Yepremian’s missed field goal attempt was intercepted by a teammate and saved the day.

Super Bowl XIX was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Miami Dolphins and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1984 season. 
On the following possession, the Buffalo offense found a way to set up kicker Tyler Bass for a game-winning, 61-yard field goal – the longest of his career. Trailing by three with five seconds remaining, the Dolphins were unable to score on the final play of the game, falling to the Bills 30-27 at Highmark Stadium.
