It was horrible for me last year. And I usually do great on Sunday night. A few of my reliable restaurants were closed (Super Bowl night is notoriously slow for restaurant dine-in service so some small places close) and the ones that were open were packed and had long waits. My plan for tomorrow is to make as much money as I can before the game.

Method #2 – Order with Uber Eats: Open the Uber or Uber Eats app, place an eligible order (as defined below) for delivery or pickup from any restaurant or merchant partner available on the Uber platform to receive an entry into the Sweepstakes. All applicable taxes and order fees still apply and does not increase chances of winning.

DoorDash received 8 million entries to its ambitious Super Bowl sweepstakes offering one person an item from every ad that ran during the Big Game. Now that a winner is flaunting their prizes, the

That means in general, you’ll maximize your earnings within about a four or five-hour window on Super Bowl Sunday.
