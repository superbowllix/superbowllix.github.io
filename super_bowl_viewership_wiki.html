The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show starring Michael Jackson is the most watched Super Bowl halftime show, with a TV audience of more than 133.4 million viewers. [68] [69] The Super Bowl LVI halftime show starring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar and 50 cent is the most viewed Super Bowl halftime show on YouTube with  
Super Bowl advertisers paid up to $8 million to secure a spot in television's most watched broadcast. Here's a lineup by product category of the commercials that will run.
