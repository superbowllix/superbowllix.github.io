        <p>How Has the Pay Varied in the History of the Game? Dating back to Super Bowl I, the payouts for winning and playing in the game appear, at first glance, to have changed dramatically. Back in the first Super Bowl, the winner was paid $15,000, and the loser $7,500. 
How much is too much to pay a quarterback? Plenty of experts around the NFL would argue there is no such number.  Only one QB since 1994 has won a Super Bowl with a cap hit percentage higher  
The average spend on a Super Bowl QB has been just 6.4%. If Brady wins the Super Bowl his cap percentage will fit between the Manning brothers at 11.1%. Russell Wilson’s 0.49% would rank below all others except for Brady in 2001 who cost just 0.47% of the Patriots salary cap.

There's an enormous financial divide among the 4 NFL quarterbacks still hoping to win the Super Bowl.  Mahomes' pay this season totaled $59.4 million.  Purdy would earn the standard $164,000  
The bonus associated with playing in the Super Bowl grows each year, according to the agreement. Last year the winners’ bonus was $157,000. Next year, it’s set to rise to $171,000. By the 2030-31 football season (the last seasons covered in the most recent bargaining agreement), the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000. 
Brock Purdy, meanwhile, is the San Francisco 49ers' 'Mr.Irrelevant' who has defied the odds to become the third-youngest quarterback to start in aÂ Super Bowl.Â 
Super Bowl winners took home a bonus of $157,000 during the 2022 NFL season. That number rose by a total of $7,000 this season, bringing the total to $164,000 for members of the winning team this  
For a player like 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, who was the last player selected in the 2022 NFL Draft, winning the Super Bowl would be more meaningful financially than to most of his teammates  
Below, we look at the average salaries and contracts for the 13 highest-paid players in the Super Bowl and both head coaches. Andy Reid, Chiefs — $12 million Andy Reid after winning Super Bowl LIV. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Winners' bonus: $164,000; Losers' bonus: $89,000; REQUIRED READING:49ers QB Brock Purdy to make history for Arizona high schools with Super Bowl 58 start Purdy has already accumulated $174,000 in  
Winning the Super Bowl is the dream of every NFL player – and doing so will net those victorious a hefty payday thanks to the prize money on the line. While lifting the Vince Lombardi trophy is the goal in the 59th edition of the Super Bowl this Sunday, players can rest assured that they’ll be rewarded financially win or lose in the New

One stat that stands above the rest is the percentage of cap space used by QBs and Super Bowl wins. The highest paid Super Bowl winning QB was Tom Brady in 2020. His cap hit was $28 million, or just over 14% of the cap. Some would say that is an outlier because a lot of veterans took pay cuts to join the Bucs and chase a ring.
