The commercial, promoting the home-sharing platform Vrbo, was aired during the Super Bowl and showcases unconventional accommodations, including farm animals, against the backdrop of the traditional Newfoundland and Labrador folk song, "I’se The B’y." The ad playfully takes a jab at competitors like Airbnb. 
After Newfoundlanders took offence to an ad during one of the biggest annual TV event of the year, Target knew it had to move quickly to craft a response. During this year’s Super Bowl, earlier this month, vacation rental company Vrbo ran an ad that used the traditional Newfoundland and Labrador folk song “I’se the B’y.” 
Newfoundland and Labrador fights back against 'unflattering' Vrbo ad shown during Super Bowl Newfoundland and Labrador tourism officials have released an advertisement highlighting the province’s rugged scenery and lively music in response to a vacation rental company’s ad that prompted a call from the premier for it to be pulled.

VRBO ran a commercial with a Newfoundland classic song “I’se the b’y” during the Super Bowl yesterday and it has caused a lot of complaining on line, which is to be expected from us. Folks from here though it was a bit insensitive for various reasons, one being it wasn’t an ad for vacationing here.

It's just a commercial that's playing what is a pretty silly song. The lyrics used doesn't mention Newfoundland. The commercial isn't shot in Newfoundland. Nothing in the commercial implies they're in Newfoundland or that it has anything to do with Newfoundland. It's likely that few people who aren't from Newfoundland would even recognize the song. </p>
