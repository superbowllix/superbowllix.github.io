        <p>While viewership for prime time series and other annual events such as the Academy Awards has declined over time, viewership of the Super Bowl has remained stable. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [ 7 ] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
The audience for Super Bowl LVIII was so large that it approached the all-time most watched television broadcast in the United States set in 1969, when an estimated 125 to 150 million viewers  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
Over 123 million people in the United States tuned in to watch last year’s game, a record for Super Bowl viewership and the most popular television program in American history. According to Census Bureau data, the estimated resident population of the United States was 338,740,353 in February 2024. That means approximately 36% — more than  
That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
Super Bowl television ratings and shares, including network (both NBC and CBS televised the first Super Bowl). The rating represents the percentage of televisions tuned in to a program. The share is the percentage of televisions on at the time that watched: 
The National Football League championship averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS , opens new tab alone on Sunday, topping last year's audience for the Super Bowl, which drew a record 115.1 million  
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
In the United States, a custom survey from Nielsen and the NFL revealed that Super Bowl LVIII reached approximately 210 million viewers – nearly 2/3 of Americans – across CBS Television  
The most-watched Super Bowl Halftime Show is Michael Jackson’s iconic 1993 set at Super Bowl XXVII, drawing a reported 133.4 million American viewers. Before Jackson, the Halftime Show was largely uneventful and featured less appealing acts. 
Last year's Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles drew 115 million viewers, the largest number since the epic New England Patriots-Seattle Seahawks slugfest in 2014  
Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, was the site of Super Bowl LVIII, the most-watched broadcast in American television history.. The Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969, is reported to have been watched by 125–150 million people. [4] 
Super Bowl. Year. ASL Performer. XXVI. 1992. Lori Hilary. XXVII. 1993. Marlee Matlin. XXVIII. 1994. Courtney Keel Foley. XXIX. 1995. Heather Whitestone. XXX. 1996  
Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). 
Best estimate for watching is in the range of 100 to 150 million viewers.  Compared to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas last year, hotel rooms are harder to come by as the selection is more limited  
The Eagles and Chiefs' 2023 Super Bowl clash - which the latter won - drew incredible viewing figures. A whopping 115.1 million viewers tuned in to watch the Chiefs' 38–35 triumph at Super Bowl 57. The record was eclipsed the following year, with 123.7 million viewers tuning in to watch the Chiefs' overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers. 
The Super Bowl is not just a major sporting event, but also a cultural phenomenon that has a significant impact on American society. As millions of viewers tune in to watch the game each year, the Super Bowl has become a platform for showcasing American values, traditions, and entertainment. </p>
