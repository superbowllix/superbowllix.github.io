        <h2><strong>wrestlemania vs super bowl viewers super bowl champion nfl</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl and WrestleMania are both highly anticipated annual events that draw in millions of viewers from around the world. While the Super Bowl is the championship game of the National Football League and showcases the top two teams in American football, WrestleMania is the biggest event in the world of professional wrestling, featuring top  
Last year, Super Bowl 50 drew 111.9 million viewers and 16.9 million Tweets.  (WrestleMania; Super Bowl) Notes: Santa Clara: WrestleMania 31: Super Bowl 50: $23.2 Million; $11.6 Million: 
Also, WrestleMania 38 had 87 Million engagements whereas Super Bowl LVI had 78 Million engagements. The above numbers indeed prove that this year’s WrestleMania was a huge success for WWE. And the reason behind this was all the outstanding matches and the grand surprises that made the fans go absolutely berserk. 
WrestleMania 38 Social Media Stats vs. Super Bowl LVI Impressions: WWE: 2.2 Billion Impressions vs. Super Bowl: 1.8 Billion Impressions Video Views: WWE: 1.1 Billion Video Views vs. Super Bowl  
WrestleMania 38 beat Super Bowl LVI with 2.2 billion social media impressions for WWE vs. 1.8 billion impressions for the NFL. WWE won in video views with WrestleMania at 1.1 billion vs. Super Bowl at 618 million. WWE won in engagements with WrestleMania at 87 million vs. Super Bowl at 78 million. 
In comparison, Super Bowl LVI brought in 618 million video views, 3.56 million hours of video watch time and 78 million engagements. See Also: 'Sonic the Hedgehog 2' Conquers Weekend Box Office  
Non-American football fans can tune into the Super Bowl and be entertained by the advertisments. A non-wrestling fan is not going to shell out money to watch Wrestlemania. In short, Wrestlemania has broad appeal and even non-wrestling fans are aware of it. But its cultural impact is like 0.00000000001% of the Super Bowl. 
NBCUniversal has officially announced that WrestleMania 39 broke records for usage on Peacock over the past weekend, with the WWE flagship event scoring the second-highest viewership ever and generating the most hours watched of any Peacock live event except for the Super Bowl. The live viewership of WrestleMania 39 events (including the Hall  
The Super Bowl has more viewers than Wrestlemania. 19 of the top 20 most viewed programs in the history of US are Super Bowls. Wiki User. ∙ 2017-10-01 12:15:28. 
Let's examine Wrestlemania viewership. Let's take both Wrestlemania and the Superbowl from 2009 and let's compare the two. Super Bowl XLIII- in 2009 holds the record for total U.S. viewership, attracting an average audience of 98.7 million. By comparison, Wrestlemania total worldwide buys amounted to 960,000. Now, let's say the average number  
The Super Bowl remains the leader in sports business, but WrestleMania is no economic slouch. WWE's top show lays the smackdown on many a sporting event. Video Play Button 
WrestleMania 38 beat Super Bowl LVI with 2.2 billion social media impressions for WWE vs. 1.8 billion impressions for the NFL. WWE won in video views with WrestleMania at 1.1 billion vs. Super  
Everyone enjoys the odd Super Bowl commercial if only because of how random they always seem to be. Still, one thing that sticks in the mind of most viewers is that while they’re watching the commercials, it automatically means they aren’t watching any form of action – which is what the game is all about. 
WrestleMania 38’s social media engagements impressively surpassed those of the Super Bowl in February. A summary of the statistics can be found below: WWE’s 2.2 billion impressions vs. 1.8  
According to video analytics company Conviva, WrestleMania 38 also beat Super Bowl 56 on Social Media via impressions, video views, video watch time and engagements. Impressions: WWE: 2.2 Billion Impressions vs. Super Bowl: 1.8 Billion Impressions; Video Views: WWE: 1.1 Billion Video Views vs. Super Bowl: 618 Million Video Views 
Perhaps the biggest and most prominent selling point of the SuperBowl is the commercials. Companies &amp; movie promotions pay within the realms of $5 million for a 30-second slot at the event. 
This isn’t comparing like-for-like as Wrestlemania isn’t on tv, but the Super Bowl had 1.3 million viewers when it was on the BBC this year. Who knows/cares if it’s more popular than WWE but they’re probably not a million miles away really. I would guess that the NFL being covered by the BBC probably tips it in the NFL’s favour these  
Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday night drew 123.7 million viewers across all platforms, marking an all-time audience record for a single program on U.S. airwaves, per fast-national figures. The Chiefs’ 25-22 win over the 49ers in overtime scored 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone (the total-platform number of 123.7 also includes Paramount+  
Viewership was up 29% compared to last year's Wrestlemania 38, according to NBCUniversal  event on Peacock with the exception of the Super Bowl,  8% in total viewers. Year-to-date, Raw is up  
Maybe but the Superbowl still dwarves Wrestlemania in total viewers. 4 million watched the Superbowl last year you would be lucky to get half a million for Wrestlemania. Edit for those fans downvoting, SKY gave up the rights to WWE due to poor viewing figures. </p>
