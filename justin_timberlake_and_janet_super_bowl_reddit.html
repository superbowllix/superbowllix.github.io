        <h2><strong>justin timberlake and janet super bowl reddit lamar jackson super bowl appearances</strong></h2>
        <p>I heard this was basically a Leave Justin Alone piece and is it ever. “On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
I think she's forgiving him for the way the fallout was handled. Janet was lambasted and shamed, while Justin walked away without scrutiny. He abandoned her to accept the blame. He's since apologized for his cowardice and how it affected Janet's career and emotional health. So yeah, I think she has stuff to forgive him for 
Per Janet’s documentary, he also reached out to her to make an appearance but she declined. I think this is where things went dicey. Then we get to January 2018 and Justin teased MOTW and released Filthy. The trailer for the album was immediately trashed with headlines such as “Justin Timberlake Comes Out as a White Man” lampooning the  
On February 1, 2004, Janet Jackson, then 38-years-old, and Justin Timberlake, then 23-years-old, caused a wake of mass cultural hysteria when, at the end of Jackson’s Super Bowl Halftime  
After the news broke that Justin Timberlake would headline this year's Super Bowl halftime show, this hashtag started to emerge: #JusticeForJanet. That's, of course, because during Timberlake's  
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple  
After Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake sang "Rock Your Body" together to close out the performance, Timberlake removed Jackson's top for a brief wardrobe malfunction. 
Janet Jackson revealed that she spoke to Justin Timberlake just once after the infamous “wardrobe malfunction” incident at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, advising him to remain silent. In  
Janet Jackson just reacted to criticism of Justin Timberlake years after her Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Halftime Show. 
It was Timberlake, after all, who along with Janet Jackson at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show gave birth to the phrase “wardrobe malfunction’’ and together were embroiled in “Nipplegate 
TIL that the term “wardrobe malfunction” was coined in 2004. Justin Timberlake first used it in an apology to Janet Jackson for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, where Jackson’s breast was exposed. Media began using the term, and eventually it was added to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary. 
This was the first half time show I missed. I was in the garage smoking a bowl. When I came back in, everyone was freaking out because of Janet Jackson's boob. I felt that I missed something culturally significant. I haven't missed a Super Bowl halftime show since. 
This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). I remember people being quite negative about him being picked in 2017 because it was assumed he and Janet were banned after the controversial 2004 performance - CBS officials would deny placing a ban on her. 
What people get angry about is his how he acted and what happened in the aftermath of the Super Bowl. While Janet Jackson was almost immediately disinvited and barred from the Grammys, forced to make a public apology, had film projects canceled, and was blacklisted from all CBS properties, Timberlake’s first public comment on it was “Hey  
She didn't plateau after the Super Bowl issue. She continued slowly tailing off like she had been doing for the prior decade and like most pop stars do. Hell, her next album sold 3 million copies. Meanwhile Justin Timberlake was 23 at the time, one of the most popular people on earth, and newly starting a solo career. 
Fourteen years ago, there was a massive controversy at the Super Bowl halftime show, at which Janet Jackson was the headliner and Justin Timberlake was one of the special guests. During the show, Timberlake ripped off part of Jackson's wardrobe, partially revealing her breast (with a delightful sparkly star over the nipple). 
TIL after Janet Jackson's incident at the Super Bowl halftime show, Viacom retaliated by keeping her music off their properties including MTV, VH1, and radio stations. They also rescinded her invitation to the Grammys. Justin Timberlake was still allowed to go and actually picked up some awards. 
Second issue Janet Jackson and the superbowl. Justin Timberlake revealed Janet Jacksons breast during their superbowl performance. Janet Jackson was subsequently blacklisted from media, while Justin Timberlake was allowed to still preform. In an interview he mocked her for crying about being blacklisted, and he later preformed the superbowl again. 
Edit: Idk how the comparison of black and Madonna in any way discredits Janet or her talent. They both were Super Bowl headliners, they both came out of the 80’s and into the new millennium with timeless dance hits, and they both advocated for equality and change. 
I refuse to believe Justin is so stupid he would reference a highly divisive celebrity about not being sorry to anybody says after his ex tried to get her fans to ease off because they are now several years into a "fuck Justin for what he did to Britney and Janet" campaign </p>
