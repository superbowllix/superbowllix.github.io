        <h2><strong>jets lions super bowl 2025 preseason super bowl favorites</strong></h2>
        <p>A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. [5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952  
In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. The first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, so Detroit's championships do not count as Super Bowl  
The Lions won four NFL Championship Games between 1935 and 1957. Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
11: Odds and ends. The Lions made the playoffs for the first time in the Super Bowl era in 1970 but dropped a divisional round game to the Cowboys by the odd score of 5-0.The Cowboys got a fourth  
The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships  
Super Bowl champions by year. 1967 Super Bowl (1): Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 1968 Super Bowl (2): Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14 1969 Super Bowl (3): New York Jets 16  
The Lions have won four NFL championships in their history but only three playoff wins in the Super Bowl era (1966). The Lions’ first playoff appearance in the Super Bowl era was a 5-0 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in 1970. 
The Lions have not yet reached the Super Bowl, as of December 2024. The Detroit Lions have a playoff record of 9 wins and 14 losses, and they have won four NFL championships. 
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. The Lions also lost the 1954 NFL Championship in their quest for a three-peat. 
Detroit is one of four franchises to never reach the Super Bowl, along with the Cleveland Browns, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans. Of those four, the Lions are the only one who have been in existence for the entirety of the Super Bowl era, which began in 1966 (the Browns did not exist from 1996-98). Last year marked the Lions’ first
