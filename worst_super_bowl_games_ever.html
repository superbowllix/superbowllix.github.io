A Super Bowl full of iconic moments, the Arizona Cardinals pulled off a nearly impossible comeback and took the lead late in the fourth quarter, nearly winning the game with under two minutes to go with one of the best touchdown receptions the Super Bowl had ever seen, a 64-yard catch-and-run from Larry Fitzgerald.
