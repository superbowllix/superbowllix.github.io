An MVP has been honored for every Super Bowl, but the trophy, which is named after longtime NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, was first given out at Super Bowl 25. And one player in this year’s Big  
More than 26,000 men have played in the National Football League. Only 48 of them can claim to be a Super Bowl MVP. There have been 56 Super Bowls prior to 2023. 
Moments after leading a winning drive, Patrick Mahomes was named Super Bowl MVP on Sunday, fresh off a performance in which he threw for 333 yards and ran for 66 more, leading the Chiefs to a 25  
Super Bowl Date Score MVP LVIII: Feb. 11, 2024: Chiefs 25, 49ers 22 (OT) Patrick Mahomes: LVII: Feb. 12, 2023: Chiefs 38, Eagles 35: Patrick Mahomes: LVI 
His third Super Bowl MVP Award, quite fittingly, tied Mahomes with Montana for the second-most all-time, behind Tom Brady's five. Mahomes also became only the third back-to-back Super Bowl MVP  
A panel made up of 16 media members working the Super Bowl selects the MVP. A fan vote is also used, but fan voting accounts for only 20% of the vote. That leaves 43% to the other positions. 
Mahomes finished the night with 333 yards and two touchdowns on 34 of 46 passing. But he also ran for a team-high 66 yards on nine carries, the second-most rushing yards by a quarterback in Super  
Super Bowl Most Valuable Players: NO. PLAYER: HIGHLIGHTS: I: Bart Starr, QB, Green Bay: Two touchdown passes: II: Bart Starr, QB, Green Bay: 202 yards passing, 1 TD 
The Super Bowl MVP is one of the more wagered outcomes outside of the actual Super Bowl itself. And yet, it probably shouldn't be? Most of the time, the MVP winner of the Super Bowl is the  
Jackson is the only quarterback to win the MVP award since Brian Sipe of the Cleveland Browns in 1980 who has never played in a Super Bowl. Jackson is also the only player with multiple MVP awards  
The Chiefs and Eagles, two teams with stacked rosters, will face off in Super Bowl 59. But which of the two teams' stars will win Super Bowl MVP? As BetMGM Sportsbook's odds currently stand, three  
It’s tempting to put Hurts ahead of Barkley since 1) Hurts looked Super Bowl MVP-worthy in his last Super Bowl and 2) it’s often a quarterback award. Then again, Barkley has a lot of narrative  
Patrick Mahomes was by far the most common selection to win Super Bowl MVP, finishing with 37 of the 67 votes (55.2%). He earned the MVP award in all three of his previous championships with  
Tyler Forness: (Editor's note: Forness picked the Chiefs to win in our predictions post) The Super Bowl MVP has gone to a player on the winning team in every instance but one: Super Bowl V when Dallas Cowboys LB Chuck Howley won the award in a 16-13 loss to the Baltimore Colts. This could be the second instance, as Saquon Barkley is the engine  
Cooper Kupp was crowned MVP at Super Bowl LVI for the Rams in 2022 with his two touchdowns and 99 all-purpose yards earning him the award over Matthew Stafford. Barkley is without a doubt the most likely non-quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP and the running back is currently priced at +260 with most USA bookmakers to take home the award. 
An MVP has been honored for every Super Bowl, but the trophy, which is named after longtime NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, was first given out at Super Bowl XXV. And one player in this year’s  
The two-time league MVP had arguably his best statistical performance in his four Super Bowl appearances last year in Las Vegas, when he passed for a personal-best 333 yards in a 25-22 overtime
