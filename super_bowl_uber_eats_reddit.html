Stupid question, I know, but the past couple weeks I've been going under the assumption that Super Bowl Sunday is gonna be good for orders, but knowing Uber, it just occurred to me that might not be the case. Market might be saturated with drivers, too - but I think it'll be worth a shot. 
Uber Eats‚Äô 2025 Super Bowl uncovers a remarkable conspiracy: Football was created to make people hungry.. So for its Big Game spot, the brand is revealing the dark secret history of football

The piles of buffalo wings Evans ate while filming Uber Eats' 2025 Super Bowl ad highlights a perhaps unexpected aspect of the "Hot Ones" host's life: He doesn't really order wings at restaurants.

Please tell me y‚Äôall have seen some of the response videos to the Super Bowl Uber eats commercial. People, especially on TikTok, are really getting up in arms about the 10 second joke about a guy with a peanut allergy forgetting peanuts are in peanut butter üò≠

Honestly, fuck those delivery apps. Every time I‚Äôve ever used either DoorDash or Uber eats, something about the experience is bad: incorrect or missing items, cold food, delivered to wrong place, phone calls/texts from incompetent drivers, undelivered orders marked as delivered, and issues with customer service in resolving any issues. 
That relatable moment is why the Uber Eats Super Bowl commercial will be a big hit. Be sure to catch the 2024 Uber Eats Super Bowl commercial on Sunday, February 11 during the big game. And, make sure to place that Uber Eats order early. No one wants to ruin the night by forgetting to place that order. 
Fast food and corporate places will stay open, but you might find some independent places closed early. - Wingstop turns off their third-party deliveries. This is probably so that they don't get too overwhelmed. - Looooong waits at the places that are open. Last year, Super Bowl Sunday was awful. I'll be taking that night off this year. </p>
