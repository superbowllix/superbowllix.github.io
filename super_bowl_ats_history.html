        <p>Here is a look at every Super Bowl spread and total (if available) since 1967 when the first Super Bowl was played. I have listed which team won the game with the score, and most importantly with the ATS winner, as well as the result of the over/under. 
Super Bowl History For Spread And Totals Betting. Historical data shows that Super Bowl winners almost always cover the spread. A comprehensive look at past winners reveals this trend to be a constant, as the eventual winner has covered the spread in nine of the last 10 games, and 17 of the past 20. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
The Bills and the Vikings are the only teams in Super Bowl history to go 0-4 against the spread. In the 2019 Super Bowl, Star quarterback Tom Brady and the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a margin of 13-3 – and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. The three points by the  
The team favored to win the Super Bowl has a 37-21 record straight up. However, underdogs have won six of the last ten Super Bowls now. Favorites no longer have an edge when it comes to covering the spread in the Super Bowl, though. The team favored to win the Super Bowl is 28-28-2 against the spread. 
Super Bowl betting history has seen the underdog cash the past four years, with the Chiefs winning in that role in the last two. Check the chart below for ATS &amp; OVER/UNDER results in all Super Bowls. 
SUPER BOWL LINE HISTORY. The Super Bowl betting history covers the first 58 matchups of the NFL finale, focusing on the two teams, the betting lines and the final score. The Super Bowl betting result is covered in the ATS (Against the Spread) column, which lists the favorite-underdog outcome and the ‘over-under’ result. 
Super Bowl point spread history. The following table looks at the closing point spreads and eventual ATS results for each of the last 10 Super Bowls. Year Favorite Point spread Underdog 
The Eagles are 2-0 ATS in their previous Super Bowl appearances, splitting their series against the Patriots. Here is a betting rundown of every Super Bowl. This list includes the Super Bowl number, the teams, betting line, O/U, final score and how the favorites and total fared. Complete Super Bowl Betting History ATS, O/U &amp; More 
Four times in Super Bowl history has the spread crossed over the key numbers of 3, 7, 10, 14 or 17 between the opening and closing point spreads, or crossed through zero. Three of the four times the line movement has predicted the SU and ATS winner, with the exception being Super Bowl 48, when the Broncos closed as favorites and lost 43-8. 
Roughly 112 million people watched the Super Bowl last year, despite the NFL’s ratings decline overall. A similar number are expected to tune in to this year’s contest, between the New England  
Super Bowl commercials over the years have tried to make us laugh, cry -- and most importantly -- buy stuff. Today a 30-second slot goes for $5 million, but back in 1967 it was a different story. 
Each year, the Super Bowl draws upward of 100 million eyeballs—Super Bowl LVIII 2024 was the most-watched program in U.S. history, averaging 123.7 million viewers—and a significant chunk of  
Since then, the cost for advertising time has increased significantly with companies paying an average of $5.2 million for 30 seconds of air time during Super Bowl LIII in 2019. Below is a yearly chart with the average cost of Super Bowl ads, as well as their rating, share and viewership. Throughout the years, there have been a number of iconic

Super Bowl betting trends show tight ATS and O/U results. Favorites are 28-27-2 in the 57 Super Bowls that have been contested. The OVER and UNDER are deadlocked at 28-28 in Super Bowl betting

The Super Bowl brings the biggest menu of betting of the year, but let’s focus on simply the point spread and what the big game history says about how to bet on the point spread. 
In a game with a small point spread, it appears that this game is focusing on picking the winner of the game, which would help draw you to the back-to-back winner on Super Bowl Sunday.
