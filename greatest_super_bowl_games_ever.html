        <h2><strong>greatest super bowl games ever bears super bowl date</strong></h2>
        <p>Here's a look at the 10 greatest Super Bowls ever played: 1.  No list of the greatest games in Super Bowl history would be complete without the game that put the Super Bowl on the map. 
The first-ever Super Bowl took place on Jan. 15, 1967, and saw the Green Bay Packers beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-10. Including that inaugural Super Bowl, there have been a total of 56. In those 56 Super Bowls, we have seen players become legends, teams become dynasties, and plays become immortalized in the football replay vault. 
HM. Super Bowl XXXVI: Patriots 20, Rams 17. Nobody saw Tom Brady coming at this point. This emotional game, played in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, was all about Kurt Warner and St. Louis  
16. Super Bowl LIV: Kansas City Chiefs 31, San Francisco 49ers 20. 15. Super Bowl XLV: Green Bay Packers 31, Pittsburgh Steelers 25. 14. Super Bowl LII: Philadelphia Eagles 41, New England  
A Super Bowl full of iconic moments, the Arizona Cardinals pulled off a nearly impossible comeback and took the lead late in the fourth quarter, nearly winning the game with under two minutes to go with one of the best touchdown receptions the Super Bowl had ever seen, a 64-yard catch-and-run from Larry Fitzgerald. 
From last-second wins to incredible touchdowns, these matchups stand out as the best Super Bowl games in history. 
Here, we look at the 10 best Super Bowl games ever played. Related: Live Super Bowl 2024 Updates: Follow Our Real-Time Coverage Blog for Latest News &amp; Highlights Super Bowl XXXIV : Rams 23, Titans 16 
"The Greatest Show on Turf" -- in perhaps the greatest team victory in Super Bowl history. St. Louis could not get its offense going in the first half but put together impressive drives in the  
2. Super Bowl XXIV: January 28, 1990, Superdome in New Orleans . San Francisco 49ers 55, Denver Broncos 10 . Joe Montana throws a pass against the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl XXIV on Jan. 28  
This game still holds the record for the coldest Super Bowl ever played with the kickoff temperature being 39 °F at New Orleans’ Tulane Stadium. 
From last minute touchdowns to huge upsets, DAZN looks at the best ever Super Bowls. The Super Bowl is commonly referred to as the greatest show on earth, and while a few have disappointed over the years the vast majority have lived up to the hype. Super Bowl LVII in February 2023 had a viewership  
The Super Bowl is obviously the biggest game of the NFL season, so it makes sense that a number of the championship games throughout the league’s history have been iconic. Teams and players are  
The game’s greatest QB of all-time (Brady) squaring off against the reigning Super Bowl champs and its MVP QB — Patrick Mahomes. While Tampa Bay had to win three road games to reach the Super Bowl, Kansas City took care of business at home following a 14-2 regular season. 
Many of those ads have delivered moments that are remembered as much as the games themselves. Ahead of Super Bowl LIX (Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX), here are the 10 greatest Super Bowl commercials  
21. Super Bowl XLV (2011) Green Bay Packers def. Pittsburgh Steelers, 31-25. The never-quit attitude of the Steelers made this a great game after the Packers were dominating 21-10 at halftime. 
Tom Brady is regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever step on the field in large part because of his unmatched success in Super Bowl games. Things were shaping up nicely for Brady to add another chapter to his growing legend in 2008, when he led the Patriots to a perfect regular season and was just a Super Bowl win over the Giants  
Brady threw for a then-Super Bowl record 466 yards, leading his team to 31 unanswered points and earning MVP honors a record-breaking fourth time as New England forged the greatest comeback ever  
The greatest Super Bowl moments include everything from dazzling runs, electric kickoff returns, clutch catches, and field goals to win games. NFL greats such as Tom Brady, Adam Vinatieri, Joe Montana, John Elway, James Harrison, Marcus Allen, and Desmond Howard find themselves all over this list of greatest Super Bowl moments ever. Go ahead  
The top spot on the list of the best Super Bowls of all time belongs to Super Bowl XLII featuring the New York Giants against the New England Patriots.The Patriots came into this game undefeated on the season, seeking to become the first team to go undefeated through the season and the Super Bowl since the 1972 Miami Dolphins. 
The Super Bowl is synonymous with many things, including the national anthem, halftime entertainment, commercials and, of course, food. When it comes to the actual game, big plays have played an  </p>
