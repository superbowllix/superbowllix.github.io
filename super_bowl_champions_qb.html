        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season.

Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Some of the most notable achievements by Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks include: Most TD Passes in a Super Bowl – Steve Young with 6 TDs in Super Bowl XXIX. Youngest QB to Win – Ben Roethlisberger, at age 23, in Super Bowl XL. Oldest QB to Win – Tom Brady, at age 43, in Super Bowl LV. 
The oldest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl is Tom Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who was 43 years old in Super Bowl 55. The youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl was Ben Roethlisberger  
T here have been 820 quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era — 34 have won a Super Bowl; and 13 have won more than one Super Bowl. If Patrick Mahomes wins next Sunday, he will join Troy Aikman (3), Terry Bradshaw (4), Joe Montana (4), and Tom Brady (7) as the only quarterbacks to win three or more Super Bowls.

Both quarterbacks have also experienced roughly a tale of two seasons, enduring a turnover-littered stretch to open the season -- with Hurts forcing passes in key spots, including the red zone  
Concluding his career as a seven-time Super Bowl champion, five-time Super Bowl MVP, and three-time NFL MVP, Brady’s legacy seems challenging for any quarterback to surpass. His legendary performances in numerous high-pressure games, including the masterful comeback against the Falcons in Super Bowl LI, firmly established Brady as the  
His counting numbers in Super Bowl competition are the stuff of lore; he's the all-time leader in Super Bowl passing touchdowns (21), completions (277), attempts (421) and passing yards (3,039). 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
There have been just five rookie quarterbacks to start in a conference championship game, and they all lost, falling one game short of a Super Bowl appearance. Buccaneers QB Shaun King became the  
Editor’s note: This post has been updated with new information. With the 2025 Super Bowl on the way, we’ll soon know if a new NFL quarterback will join the eternal list of Super Bowl champions. 
In 1964, Joe Namath was the first football quarterback to win both a Super Bowl and college championship when his Jets beat the Colts in Super Bowl III, as Jetswire reports.

Before securing its spot this season, Philadelphia's last Super Bowl appearance was in Super Bowl 57, at the end of the 2022 season. Only the 49ers have won the NFC since.
