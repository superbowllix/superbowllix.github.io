        <p>Super Bowl MVP: You can also bet on who will be named the Most Valuable Player of the game. This often goes to a quarterback, but sometimes a standout runner or receiver steals the show. Total Sacks or Interceptions: For those who appreciate defensive play, you can place over/under bets on total sacks or interceptions in the game. 
The best Super Bowl odds for teams who did not make the playoffs and didn't have significant time missed from their starting QBs are the Chargers (2,500) 11th, and Jaguars (2,800) 12th. The three teams with the worst pre-season Super Bowl odds but made the playoffs are the Texans (20,000, 31st), Buccaneers (10,000, 29th), and the Rams (8,000  
Any thoughts on the Over Under in the Super Bowl this year? Discussion I like the Under in the Super Bowl this year, I think the 2 teams will run the ball a lot and either team will end up winning 27-20 or 24-20. 
1. Chiefs Over/Under 2.5 field goals. You have to go all the way back to the Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl in February 2023 to find the last time Harrison Butker missed a field goal in the playoffs. He  
Doug Clawson: Patrick Mahomes rush yards over 28.5 (-110): Mahomes relies on his legs a lot more in the playoffs and he has gone over that number (29, 33, 41, 66) in all four career Super Bowl  
The Eagles won their most recent battle in late 2023, winning a 21-17 squeaker that hit the Under. However, the Over has hit in four of their last six matchups, including Super Bowl 57, which saw  
The Chiefs advanced to their third straight Super Bowl with a cover as 1-point home favorites in a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game Sunday as the Over (49) hit. QB Patrick Mahomes was 18-of-26 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD, while adding 2 more TDs on the ground as he rushed for 43 yards on 11 carries. 
The latest 2025 Super Bowl odds list Kansas City as a 1.5-point favorite, while the over/under is 48.5 points. The Chiefs are -123 money-line favorites (risk $123 to win $100), while the Eagles  
Let's take a look at the latest total and then I'll break down whether I'm backing the OVER or UNDER. Chiefs vs. Eagles Total for Super Bowl 59 OVER 48.5 (-110)

Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money.

Here's a dive into the latest 2025 Super Bowl odds, including tracking the Chiefs vs. Eagles moneyline movement since Championship Sunday.  Over 49.5 (-110) | Under  News Tips Submitting  
In last year's Super Bowl LVIII, Reba McEntire's rendition seemingly hit the Under on length. But an extra "brave" at the end technically sent the song Over. Ultimately, some sportsbooks ended up  
Just click the blue copy button after clicking the link (you'll need a Gmail account), and it should fork over a personal copy for you that you can proceed to edit and whatnot for your group.

I built out a Google Sheet for the Printable Super Bowl Prop Bet for work/friend pool. A digital Printable Super Bowl Prop Bet Sheet, if you will.

Hey everyone! I'm gearing up to host a Super Bowl party this year, and I want to take it to the next level with some friendly bets among friends. We've done the usual squares and over/under bets before, but I'm on the hunt for some fresh, unique ideas to keep the excitement going throughout the game. 
On top of this, all throughout the Super Bowl Prop Bets menu you will find many overs juiced to sucker people into thinking the over is more likely or to squeeze a couple of extra bucks out of the guys who refuse to bet an under whether it's a silly prop bet like this or an actual player prop. 
Credit to u/ConorFerg for the inspiration on this from last year's prop bet sheet: Old Super Bowl LVI Prop Bet Reddit Post. As he noted: "For those who haven't seen this before, this is a printable props betting sheet with a bunch of different categories (Over/Under, Yes/No Props, Halftime show, Commercial, etc.). </p>
