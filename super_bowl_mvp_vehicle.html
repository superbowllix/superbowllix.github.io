        <p>The Cadillac Escalade once again returned as the car-of-choice of the Super Bowl MVP when Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Hines Ward opted for the SUV as his winning car. The whole game was a  
From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car as a part of their MVP award. However, since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50. [13] 
Since Unitas took the keys to that Vette 57 years ago, every Super Bowl MVP has won a car, save for one. In 2010, Saints quarterback Drew Brees (XLIV) was the victim of a global financial crisis  
The Super Bowl MVP trophy has been won by some of the biggest names in American football history.  Tom Brady gifted Malcolm Butler his Super Bowl MVP car. Expand Tweet. Trending • 70% Win  
One Super Bowl tradition came to an end a couple years ago when the NFL stopped giving the game’s MVP a brand new car. But over the years MVPs drove off in some of the nicest cars and trucks available at that time. Here are a few of those lucky guys and their rides. Bart Starr – 1967 &amp; 68 
Mahomes, this year's Super Bowl MVP, wasn't given a new car because of a flurry of contract decisions made by the NFL and its sponsors. Chevrolet had secured deals with the NFL as the motor sponsor of the sport. Part of the sponsorship deal included a MVP giveaway at the Super Bowl. 
The prize for his MVP performance was a blue Dodge Charger R/T, complete with a snarling 440-cid V8. “That’s why I call the MVP car a win-win-win,” Namath explained. “Even Uncle Sam gets his cut.” While the first years of the Super Bowl coincided with the heyday of American muscle, not every MVP was so fired up about receiving a  
An MVP has been honored for every Super Bowl, but the trophy, which is named after longtime NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, was first given out at Super Bowl 25. And one player in this year’s Big  
Super Bowl XLV MVP Aaron Rogders receives the keys to a new 2011 Chevrolet Camaro Convertible.  Eli Manning of the Giants won this car at Super Bowl XLVI. Joe Flacco, 2013. Darron Cummings/AP. 
Last year, Super Bowl XLVII MVP Joe Flacco was awarded a shiny new Chevrolet Corvette after leading the Baltimore Ravens to the Lombardi Trophy. Car companies have regularly handed over new rides  
As I’ve blogged since 2019 on this blog and every year since, I’ve confirmed the Super Bowl MVP doesn’t get a car.. In fact, the last time a Super Bowl MVP won a car was in 2015 when Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady won a 2015 Chevrolet Colorado from GM and then turned around and re-gifted it to Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler, the arguable hero of the that particular game. 
That’s because Ford is the “Official Truck of Super Bowl LVI.” If Super Bowl LVI MVP did get a free car this year, it’d probably be a 2022 Ford Lightning Platinum electric truck, since this year marks the first year Ford is delivering pre-ordered Lightnings to customers. 
He led the team to a Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl LIV, earning the Super Bowl MVP award for his performance. Mahomes is known for his work ethic, leadership, and community involvement off the field, contributing to his status as one of the league’s most respected and popular players. Also, Patrick Mahomes won the Super Bowl MVP in 2024  
From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX, MVP winners received a new car as part of their prize. However, this tradition ended when Hyundai became the official NFL sponsor in 2015 . 
Up until 2015, Super Bowl MVP winners were also given a free car. Tom Brady, after winning the award for his Super Bowl 49 performance, was the last Super Bowl MVP to be given a free vehicle.

Some fans may be taken aback when they find out that the Super Bowl MVP isn’t getting a free vehicle after the game. However, this prize isn’t the common practice it once was. 
For more than a decade, Super Bowl MVPs were awarded a car. That tradition is gone and hasn’t been replaced. By Rebecca Toback @Rebecca_Toback Updated Feb 4, 2018, 11:30pm EST
