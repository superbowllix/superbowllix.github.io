Since their creation, the Vikings as of 2022 have won at least three games in every regular season, excluding 1962, and are just one of seven teams to have been victorious in at least 15 regular season games. 
The Minnesota Vikings last lost the Super Bowl in the 1976 season. The Vikings lost to the Oakland Raiders by a score of 32-14. 
The Vikings have made four trips to the Super Bowl in their 57 years as a team.. Minnesota's first appearance in the Super Bowl was Super Bowl IV in 1970 when the Chiefs toppled the Vikings 23-7.

At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year.
