        <h2><strong>how many super bowl mvps does travis kelce have new super bowl news</strong></h2>
        <p>Here’s an overview of Travis Kelce's Super Bowl record: Super Bowl LIV: Chiefs 31, 49ers 20; Super Bowl LV: Bucs 31, Chiefs 9; Super Bowl LVII: Chiefs 38, Eagles 35; Super Bowl LVIII: Chiefs 25  
The victory marked Kelce's fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons. [158] During Super Bowl LVIII, Kelce had nine receptions for 93 yards and was the leading yards receiver for the game. The Chiefs would win 25–22 in just the second Super Bowl in history to go to overtime, earning Kelce his third Super Bowl win. [159] 
How Many Times Has Travis Kelce Played in the Super Bowl? As of January 2025, Travis Kelce has played in the Super Bowl four times, compiling a record of 3-1. The Chiefs are once again back in the AFC Championship to conclude the 2024 regular season, so another title is within each as of the writing of this article. 
Super Bowl 55. The Chiefs returned to the Super Bowl the following season to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where Kelce delivered what was arguably his most productive Super Bowl performance. He caught 10 passes for 133 yards, converting six first downs while generating three explosive plays and averaging 2.61 yards per route run. 
MORE: Is Travis Kelce Retiring? Kelce won his second Super Bowl title last year, as the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 38-35, to win Super Bowl LVII. Kelce finished with six receptions for a team-high 81 yards. He scored Kansas City’s first touchdown of the game in the first quarter, an 18-yard reception from Mahomes. In all, Kelce  
As of January 2025, Travis Kelce has won three Super Bowls. Kelce and the Chiefs have been on a great run for the past few years, which has resulted in them winning Super Bowl LIV, Super Bowl LVII  
Travis Kelce is having too much fun to retire – at least not just yet. The superstar tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs has done it all. Three Super Bowl wins (so far), 10 straight Pro Bowl  
However, none of the current tight ends in the league are as decorated as Travis Kelce, who has three Super Bowl rings. Since being drafted in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft, Kelce has amassed 1,004 receptions for 12,151 yards and 77 touchdowns through 12 regular seasons, including not playing at all in 2013. 
A. Travis Kelce has won three Super Bowls with the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2019, 2022, and 2023 seasons.  How old was Aaron Rodgers when he won the Super Bowl? Revisiting 4x MVP's Lombardi  
No player in NFL history has ever had more catches (113) and receiving yards (1,271) in a span of four consecutive postseasons than Kelce. Then there's the Super Bowl, where Kelce is fourth all  
Travis Kelce has had 31 catches for 350 yards and has scored 2 touchdowns in 4 games in Super Bowls in his career. 
Playing center along the offensive line, Kelce was drafted 191st overall in the sixth round by the Eagles out of Cincinnati, and he’s been with the team since, winning one Super Bowl ring. Now 35, Kelce has returned to the NFL for another season to help the Eagles pursue another Super Bowl title, coming off a 38-35 loss to his brother Travis  
Travis Kelce is a man who has been in the headlines for multiple different reasons. His ability as a tight end for the Chiefs has helped them to reach the 2024 Super Bowl and win the 2023 Super Bowl. 
Mahomes was named Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 286 yards and two touchdowns, including one to Travis Kelce. Mahomes also rushed for a score. They've won two more titles after that. 
However, Mahomes is far from the player with the most Super Bowl rings. That honor goes to Tom Brady.. How many championship rings does Tom Brady have? Brady has seven championship rings, having  
Kelce recorded nine receptions (on 10 targets) for 93 yards in Sunday's 25-22 overtime victory over the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. Kelce was held nearly silent in the first half, as he had only  
Does the Super Bowl MVP name drop Taylor? Yes: +430 / No: -670.  Will Travis Kelce propose after the Super Bowl? Yes: +750 / No: -1500. I have to stick with the chalk pick here. While they  
Kelce already holds the single-game Super Bowl record for most yards by a tight end, according to StatMuse.He had 10 catches on 15 targets for 133 yards in the 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay in Super Bowl 55. 
More value to bet Mahomes to twin MVP than the Chiefs (+380) to win the Super Bowl. The unquestioned best in the game for a reason. Worth a play at 4/1. Travis Kelce (+5000) Swifties will scream for Travis to claim the MVP and if he can catch 9 or more balls for 160 or more along with 2-3 touchdowns and maybe. 
Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has accepted how far his reach has extended thanks to his high-profile girlfriend. As the Chiefs attempt to pull off an unprecedented "three-peat" at Super Bowl 59, Kelce welcomes the chance to take the spotlight. </p>
