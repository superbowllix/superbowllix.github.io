When the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles square off Sunday in New Orleans, starting quarterbacks from the same state will be going head-to-head for the fifth time in Super Bowl history. 
The most recent Super Bowl-winning quarterback from Texas is Matthew Stafford, who played in the Dallas enclave of Highland Park before going to Georgia and getting drafted No. 1 overall by  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
That really surprised me. But Texas has nine and we had this long stretch where we didn’t have a Texas high school quarterback drafted in the first round and where they weren’t playing in Super Bowls until we got Vince Young drafted in the first round and Drew Brees playing in a Super Bowl and winning a Super Bowl early in the 2000s. 
Fellow quarterback Bart Starr also won nine-consecutive postseason games during his Hall of Fame career from 1961-68.
