        <p>When was the last time the Lions lost a playoff game? In 2024, the Detroit Lions lost to the Washington Commanders in the Divisional Round. What years did the Lions make the Super Bowl? The Detroit Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl. 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. The first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, so Detroit's championships do not count as Super Bowl  
The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships  
The last time the Lions took home a championship was in 1957, prior to the first Super Bowl. The next season in 1958, the Lions traded their Hall of Fame QB Bobby Layne to the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, the Detroit Lions have won the NFL Championship 4 times, most recently in the 1957 season. 
When Was the Last Time the Lions Made the Super Bowl? The Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl but have won four NFL Championships (1957, 1953, 1952, and 1935). The last time the Lions played for an NFL Championship was 1957. Want to predict the results of the 2023 NFL postseason with our FREE NFL Playoff Predictor? 
The Detroit Lions have not yet won a Super Bowl, as of December 2024. Get detailed information on Detroit Lions Super Bowl Appearances, their championships wins and much more on Sportskeeda. 
The Lions last January crumbled away their best chance ever to reach the Super Bowl, blowing a double-digit third-quarter lead and losing a gut-wrenching NFC championship game to the San Francisco  
Until 2006, this was the last time that major professional teams from Michigan and Ohio met in a postseason game (or series) in any sport. This was the last NFL playoff game played in the city of Detroit other than Super Bowl XL until 2024 as the Lions' other two home playoff games prior (1992 and 1994) were at the Silverdome in suburban Pontiac. 
Winless on conference championship weekend: The Lions have played in two NFC conference championship games and lost both (hence the no Super Bowl trips). Last year, the Lions had a 24-7 lead over  
The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX. 
The Last Super Bowl Appearance. The Detroit Lions’ last Super Bowl appearance was on January 5, 1992, during Super Bowl XXVI. The game was held at the Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota, against the Washington Redskins. The Lions entered the game with high hopes, having won the NFC Championship that season. 
Workers hang player banners outside the Caesars Superdome, Saturday, Feb. 1, 2025, in New Orleans, prior to the NFL Super Bowl 59 football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City  
Detroit Lions Super Bowl appearances. The Lions have never appeared in the Super Bowl. They are the only team that has existed during the entire Super Bowl era that has not played in at least one such game. How many Super Bowls have the Detroit Lions won? As mentioned previously, the Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl and thus have never  
LOOKING AHEAD:Will Lions win Super Bowl 2025? Predictions for every NFL playoff game. Most valuable addition. Of all the talent the Lions acquired last offseason — trading for Carlton Davis III, signing D.J. Reader, trading up for Terrion Arnold in the draft — the player who might end up being the most valuable is cornerback Amik Robertson. 
The Lions will head west for a rematch with the 49ers, who eliminated Detroit in dramatic fashion last season. The Lions dominated the first half of that game, establishing a 24-7 halftime lead, but the 49ers stormed back in the second half to advance to the Super Bowl. Now, with both teams coming into this game with different expectations, the  
Brock Purdy threw for 267 yards and a touchdown, and the San Francisco 49ers rallied from 17 points down at halftime to beat the Detroit Lions 34-31 and reach the Super Bowl. 
Detroit is now the third team in the Super Bowl era with three wins of 35-plus points in their first 10 games of a season. They join the 1973 Falcons and 1969 Vikings in that regard. The first-team offense scored touchdowns on all seven possessions they had the ball and racked up 575 yards of total offense before handing it over to the backups  </p>
