        <p>Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have been led to the Super Bowl by Jalen Hurts. Every QB the Eagles have had has not been as successful as their current one. A look at the quarterbacks who started the most games each season for Philly since the Super Bowl began.

Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
He is the only quarterback in Eagles history to win a Super Bowl. His 27-touchdown season in 2013 led the Eagles to new heights, and he is known for the “Philly Special” play. Foles was named Super Bowl MVP and had an impressive seven-touchdown game in Oakland. 
Super Bowl 39 — February 2005; Super Bowl 52 — February 2018; Super Bowl 57 — February 2023; Although the Eagles have appeared in four Super Bowls, they also made several championship appearances in the pre-Super Bowl era. Philadelphia played in the NFL Championship Game each season from 1947-49. 
Led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, the Eagles’ offense was dynamic, with Hurts setting a Super Bowl record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (three) and amassing over 370 total yards. Though they didn’t claim the championship, the performance cemented Hurts as one of the NFL’s rising stars and showcased the team’s bright future. 
Philadelphia's first Super Bowl appearance was a 27-10 loss to the then-Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 15. Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett threw for three touchdowns while Eagles signal-caller Ron  
Philadelphia Eagles quarterbacks Nick Foles and Jalen Hurts are 1-2 since 2006 in passer rating during their Super Bowl appearances  Donovan McNabb is the only other QB to pay in the Super Bowl  
Eagles QB Jalen Hurts is entering a territory that most NFL quarterbacks never reach. He will be starting in his second Super Bowl in three years and is doing so at the young age of 26. Super Bowl LIX will be a rematch of Super Bowl LVII, two seasons ago when these two teams faced []

Jalen Alexander Hurts [1] (born August 7, 1998) is an American professional football quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He began his college football career with the Alabama Crimson Tide, leading the team to consecutive College Football Playoff National Championship appearances in 2016 and 2017. 
In Super Bowl 2023, Philadelphia Eagles QB Jalen Hurts threw for more yards than Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes (304-182) in Kansas City's 38-35 victory.If you want to bet that happening again, DraftKings makes Hurts a +170 underdog to have more passing yards than Mahomes (-235) in Super Bowl LIX. 
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett was asked about the Pittsburgh Steelers in the days before Super Bowl 59. 
It’s officially Super Bowl week as the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs have both arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana ahead of their monumental rematch. Following Philadelphia’s 2-2 start to the regular season, it was difficult to envision the Eagles reaching this point in the postseason, yet here they are. 
Way back following the 1980 season, QB Ron Jaworski helped his team cruise to a Super Bowl berth, but the Eagles were embarrassed by the Raiders in a 10-27 loss. From there Philly had a long
