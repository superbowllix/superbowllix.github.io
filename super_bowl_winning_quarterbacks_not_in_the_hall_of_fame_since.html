The Giants’ other Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks, Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, are not in the Hall of Fame, although Simms’ regular-season record with the franchise, 95-64, was superior to

Plunkett had way more career INTs than TDs, never threw for 3000 yards in a season (and only threw for more than 2,550 once), had a career completion percentage of 52.5 (Drew Brees, he was not) and never made a single Pro Bowl.

He's the only other two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback not in the Hall of Fame, even though he did win one Super Bowl MVP. To some voters, Manning might be the modern-day Plunkett. 
Accolades: Two-time Super Bowl champion, Super Bowl MVP, and two-time Pro Bowl selection Phil Simms gained a lot of early criticism despite playing with inferior talent for the New York Giants.
