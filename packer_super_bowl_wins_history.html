        <p>The Packers have won four Super Bowls in their history. They won Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II in back-to-back years, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders in 1967 and 1968  
The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL. The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) – winning the last two. 
The Green Bay Packers have won a total of 4 Super Bowls, in 1966-1967, 1996 and 2010. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in Green Bay. 
In addition, the Packers won the first two Super Bowls (vs. Kansas City in 1966, 35-10, and vs. Oakland in 1967, 33-14), as well as Super Bowls in 1996 vs. New England (35-21) and in 2010 vs

Recent struggles in the NFC Championship have kept the Green Bay Packers out of the Super Bowl in recent years, but their history in the Super Bowl is one of the richest in the NFL. With that mind, here is the Green Bay Packers' Super Bowl history, including wins, losses, opponents, years, appearances and all-time record 
The Green Bay Packers won Super Bowl I (1966), Super Bowl II (1967), Super Bowl XXXI (1996), and Super Bowl XLV (2010). Here is a list of Super Bowl wins by the Packers: Team 
Green Bay has 13 championships, more than any other NFL franchise. Prior to the Super Bowl era, the Packers won titles in 1929, 1930 and 1931 by virtue of their regular-season finish and in 1936  
The Green Bay Packers are one of the most iconic and successful franchises in NFL history, with a playoff legacy that spans generations. Known as “Titletown,” Green Bay’s success in the postseason has been a cornerstone of the team’s identity, highlighted by numerous championships, legendary players, and memorable Super Bowl triumphs. 
The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers, under coach Vince Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967; they were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) before the AFL–NFL merger. 
The Packers are one of the most successful franchises in NFL history, but by Super Bowl rings, they aren't first. Four teams have won more Super Bowls than the Packers: 6 - Patriots 
They reached the Super Bowl again during the 2004 season when they lost 24-21 to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX. Philly got revenge in Super Bowl LII with a 41-33 win over the Patriots. The Eagles reached the Super Bowl during the 2022 season when they lost Super Bowl LVII to the Chiefs 38-35. They have a chance at revenge this season. 
The Green Bay Packers’ last Super Bowl appearance was in 2010, when they beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25 to win Super Bowl XLV. It was the pinnacle of Aaron Rodgers ’ career, which included four MVP awards and first-team All-Pro selections.
