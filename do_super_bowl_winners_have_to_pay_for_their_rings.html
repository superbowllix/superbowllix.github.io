Jostens, the brand known for sports apparel, graduation gowns and class rings, is the maker behind 38 of the last 58 Super Bowl rings. Tiffany &amp; Co. has also made a few rings, including the 1987  
These Super Bowl rings’ designs have become progressively exquisite, featuring a one-carat diamond at the outset but comprising over 250 10.5-carat diamonds and 36 rubies at the last Super Bowl.

As reported by talkSPORT, the New England Patriots went all out with their Super Bowl ring from their triumph in 2015. 
Not for all the rings, but for each Super Bowl ring. The NFL puts $5,000 toward each ring for the first 150 and the team finances the rest. In some cases, it may come out of a player’s salary.

In a league of 32 teams, 12 have never won in a Super Bowl. Eight NFL teams have appeared in the Super Bowl at some point but have never won one, and four teams have never been there. 
According to their official website, Jostens has crafted 35 of the 53 sets of Super Bowl rings and were behind the Patriots' jewels in 2019, which once again broke the record for being the largest  
Super Bowl winners took home a bonus of $157,000 during the 2022 NFL season. That number rose by a total of $7,000 this season, bringing the total to $164,000 for members of the winning team this  
The Super Bowl 58 is just a few days away and the Chiefs and the 49ers are gearing up for the ultimate showdown, vying for the coveted Lombardy Trophy.
