        <h2><strong>super bowl ratings nielsen lions super bowl 2025 odds</strong></h2>
        <p>In contrast with previous years, Super Bowl IV's ratings were largely underestimated. Overnight Nielsen ratings gave the 1970 game a 38.8 rating and a 70 share, with 57 million total viewers; final numbers gave the game a 39.4 rating, 69 share, and 59.2 million total viewers. 
NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Nielsen also said Tuesday that Usher’s Super Bowl halftime performance averaged 129.3 million viewers — the most-watched Super Bowl halftime on record and a 7% increase from Rihanna’s last year (121 million). Nickelodeon’s kids-centric broadcast, the first alternate feed of a Super Bowl, averaged 1.2 million. 
NEW YORK – February 14, 2023 –An estimated 113.06 million viewers were tuned in for Super Bowl LVII on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The Super Bowl LVII telecast ran from 6:44 PM ET to 10:14 PM ET and averaged nearly 112.2 million viewers on FOX. 
According to Nielsen's National panel measurement, Super Bowl LVIII averaged nearly 124 million viewers on CBS Television Network, Paramount+, Nickelodeon, Univision, and CBS Sports, Univision and  
The longest Super Bowl game also will go down as the most-watched program in television history. According to Nielsen and Adobe Analytics, the Kansas City Chiefs' 25-22 overtime victory versus the  
UPDATE: Nielsen has updated their estimate, reporting that Super Bowl LVIII reached 123.7 million viewers, up from the initial count of 123.4 million. The Feb. 11 Super Bowl game between the  
Leading up to Super Bowl LVIII, the ratings (per Nielsen) for the NFL had been on the rise. During the 2023 regular season, the average audience across all networks was 17.9 million, a year-over  
Nielsen didn’t include out of home ratings in its totals until 2021, but a custom report for the 2017 Super Bowl put the game at 124.6 million viewers including those watching away from home. 
New York – Feb. 15, 2022 – According to preliminary results from Nielsen, the telecast of Super Bowl LVI which aired on NBC on Feb. 13, 2022, from 6:34 pm ET to 10:00 pm ET, drew an average TV audience of more than 99 million viewers who tuned in to watch the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals. 
Super Bowl LIX could get ratings boost from Nielsen out-of-home viewership expansion Nielsen's out-of-home viewership now covers 100 percent of the U.S. population, up from 66 percent a year ago. 
Super Bowl LVIII was set up for ratings success from the very beginning—with the Kansas City Chiefs defending their championship title against the San Francisco 49ers;  Nielsen data shows,  
According to results from Nielsen, the telecast of Super Bowl LV on CBS, which ran from 6:38 p.m. ET to 10:16 p.m. ET, drew an average TV audience of about 92 million viewers who tuned in to watch the Tampa Bay Buccaneers take on the Kansas City Chiefs in what turned out to be a lopsided contest. 
The measurement agency expands its capabilities to count out-of-home viewing. The post Super Bowl LIX Eyes TV Ratings Record With Nielsen Expansion appeared first on Front Office Sports. 
15.2 million people in the U.S. saw Tweets about Super Bowl 50. Those Tweets were seen a total of 1.3 billion times throughout the night. The audience reached by Tweets about the event was 53% male and 56% over the age of 25. 
Make no mistake about it, the Super Bowl is the biggest TV event of the year—by a massive margin. Last year’s game attracted more than 101 million viewers , cementing viewership of 100 million-plus for 11 of the past 12 years. 
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
Final Nielsen ratings for the Super Bowl will be issued on Tuesday. The figure is the total who watched on CBS, the Paramount+ streaming app, the Spanish-language channel Univision, N.F.L. digital  
Nielsen's expanded metrics will be included in the ratings for Super Bowl LIX, in which the Chiefs can create NFL history. Andy Reid's side could become the first-ever side to win THREE STRAIGHT Super Bowl titles with a win at Caesars Superdome. </p>
