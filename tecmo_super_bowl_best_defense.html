        <p>Their defense is one of, if not the best, very comparable to New York and Buffalo. Mike Singletary can easily run right through any offensive line and complete a sack. Richard Dent is great on defense and can get a sack if Singletary doesn’t. Their defensive backs, Donnell Woolford and Mark Carrier, always seem to intercept most passes. 
Chicago and Pittsburgh have the two best defenses in the game. I'd rank Pittsburgh as having the better defense though. Both teams have horrible offenses even though they have such great defenses. Chicago has a better offense thanks to Anderson, Bailey, and Muster. Unfortunately they don't have a passing game though. 
Read the playbook. Know how the plays work. Formation, whether it's a run or pass. Then during that brief time after you've selected what defense to play, read your opponents formation for a pass or run. 
Among the Tecmo Super Bowl community, it is common for distinguished groups/tournament organizers (such as the Tomczak Bowl) to create tier lists, rankings of a teams's potential in tournaments. Tomczak Bowl uses a tier system of play. Teams are grouped into tiers of five based on their overall strength of play. Tier 1 is reserved for the best teams while Tier 5 is for the not so great. All 28  
Defense. Tier 1 (The best of the best)  [ Post made on a Tecmo Super Bowl iphone!] Quote; fatcheerleader. Posted August 11, 2010. fatcheerleader. Members; 2.7k 
The original Tecmo Bowl is a game of numerous strategic possibilities. For many players, Tecmo Bowl is merely a game of randomly picking 1 of the 4 plays. That only gives the defense a 25% chance of success on each play. I strive for 50-75 % success with our schemes and strategies. 
On The Field: Offense And Defense By Play "In Tecmo, the best defense is a good offense." This section is organized by formation. Each part will be prefaced by an ASCII diagram of a particular formation, following by a general discussion of the plays and defenses from that formation, and concluding with a list of plays in the formation and  
The Best 1. Dallas - Offense and defense is phenomenal. 2. San Francisco - Offense is a machine, best in the game, defense is average. 3. Buffalo - The usual suspects. 4. Houston - Offense is a top machine, and defense is great. 5. New Orleans - Average offense, but that defense is the best in the game. The Worst. 1.

Ronnie Lott leads the 49ers defense, as he is the most dominant defensive back in Tecmo Bowl. Lott is also one of the best players in the game when also controlled by the computer. Defensive tackle Michael Carter is one of the elite defenders in Tecmo Bowl. Fast and powerful, but his position lends to him being blocked on run plays. 
I have begun writing a training manual for TSB3, here's the beginning: Tecmo Super Bowl 3 – Training Manual Understanding your Roster – This might be the most important aspect of learning the game. Each team has 37 players (17 offensive, 18 defensive, 2 special teams). Each player has a series of 
based on my own personal system. you might disagree, but I did it just for fun, and maybe someone will find it useful: Offense Defense KR PR Total1 49ers 500 407 31 63 10012 Oilers 514 350 25 44 9333 Giants 370 463 31 50 9144 Raiders 407 434 25 44 9105 Bills 399 383 19 50 8517 Bears 274 495 31 44 
The bears present a valid case for best D. singletary is the best ILB in the game and possibly the best run defender in general. carrier is the best pass defender(Int wise). that combonation along with good corners and a top notch DLine makes the bears the best defense in the game in my mind. Honorable Mention- Cincinati Bengals. Two Words. 
I'm curious which positions on the field for defense people find to be better than others.Is FS better than SS? LB4 better than 3,2 or 1? DE/NT?If you aren't taking specific players into consideration. 
Please post what you think are the top 5 best teams in SNES - Tecmo Super Bowl TOP 5. 1. SF. 2. BUF. 3. DAL. 4. HOU. 5. PIT. Edited March 27, 2013 by 8-bit 
I have only played the original Tecmo Super Bowl game. Is III based off the '94 players with the '95 team schedule? Yeah that was the season that the Niners were trying to build a team through free agency that could beat Dallas and the Cowboys were starting to lose some of their depth through free agency (and players like Ken Norton signed with  
I think it's the Bears. I love using Dent, Singletary, Carrier, and Co. to smother opposing offenses. 
MIA – Marino is a unique QB in Tecmo due to his excellent passing speed and good control, which can take man defenders out of their usual coverage game. And MIA has an above average core of pass catchers with Clayton/Duper/Jensen. 
I looked at everything in the playbook and it looks like the best way to do it without messing everything up and creating too much work would be to just have two types of 4/3 defenses; 4/3 right = ROLB gets moved up to line of scrimmage but at same width as he was before and the RE becomes RDT and the DT becomes LDT no moving them, or 4/3 left = the LOLB gets moved up to line of scrimmage but
