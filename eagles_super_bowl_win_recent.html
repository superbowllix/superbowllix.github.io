Despite a late surge by the Patriots, the Eagles’ defense, led by Brandon Graham, made a crucial strip-sack of Brady in the final minutes.

Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have only won one Vince Lombardi trophy and that came in their Super Bowl appearance back in 2018. With backup quarterback Nick Foles having to start for the Eagles with starter Carson Wentz injured, it seemed like the writing was on the wall against a New England Patriots team led by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have won the Super Bowl a single time, in the 2017 season. Additionally, the Philadelphia Eagles have won the NFL Championship 3 times, most recently in the 1960 season.
