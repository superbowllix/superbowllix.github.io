Conclusion. The journey to Super Bowl LIX is defined by strategic play throughout the NFL regular season and playoffs. With a total of 14 teams vying for glory, understanding how teams qualify and navigate through this structured playoff system is essential for fans and analysts alike. 
Here’s a look at the eight remaining teams in the NFL playoffs, with analysis and odds to win the conference title and qualify for Super Bowl 58 at Allegiant Stadium. 
As the NFL regular season approaches its conclusion, the race for Super Bowl LIX is heating up. Scheduled for February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, the playoffs are set to begin on January 11, 2025. 
For these 82 schools, though, they made it - and there are just enough bowl teams for slots, so no 5-7 teams with great APR. All these bowl teams are where schools like Florida State, and Wisconsin, and Virginia wish they could be. These are the bowl eligible teams for the 2024 season broken down by conference, and how many wins each one game  
The Bucs are averaging 28.6 offensive points -- fourth most in the league and third most in franchise history, trailing only the Tom Brady-led Super Bowl team in 2020 and another Brady-led team in  
The six teams who have definitely qualified for the playoffs are: 1. Detroit Lions (15-2) - won NFC North 2. Philadelphia Eagles (14-3) - won NFC East 3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (10-7) - won NFC South 4. 
He went from being drafted at No. 108 overall to starting all 169 games he played in the NFL, plus 10 playoff games and a Super Bowl. He won six Pro Bowl nods and was recognized on the All-Pro team four times, and has already been chosen for the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s All-2010s Team. 
Just two teams in the past 20 years have started 8-0 and went on to win the Super Bowl that same season (2006 Colts and '09 Saints). The 2024 Chiefs make it (a) three(-peat). Christian Gonzales

The NFL consists of 32 teams split in 2 conferences (AFC and NFC) of 16 teams each. Each conference is further split into 4 divisions (North, East, South, West) of 4 teams each. 7 teams of each conference get to the playoffs, the 4 division winners and 3 wildcards with the best remaining overall win-loss record. 
The six teams who have definitely qualified for the playoffs are: 1. Detroit Lions (15-2) - won NFC North 2. Philadelphia Eagles (14-3) - won NFC East 3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (10-7) - won NFC South 4. 
A total of 82 teams are needed to fill all 41 bowl games. Teams can only count one win against an FCS opponent toward the total number of wins needed for bowl eligibility. Teams with only seven losses will not appear in the list of eliminated teams until there are enough eligible teams to ensure they will not be needed to fill open bowl spots. 
The Dallas-Fort Worth metro area has hosted just one Super Bowl, in 2011. That was two years after Jerry World opened in 2009. Jones currently is 82, and by 2029, he'll be 86 (if he's still with us). </p>
