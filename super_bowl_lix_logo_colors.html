This year’s logo marks a return to the creativity of the Super Bowl’s best logos with its color, history, and local connection. Yet unfortunately for the 2025 logo, it’s being discussed online less for its design, and more as the subject of a conspiracy theory connecting the colors of the Super Bowl logo to those of its two teams—a

NEW YORK – Jan. 8, 2025 – The NFL announced today that renowned New Orleans artist Tahj 'Queen Tahj' Williams will be the first ever to handcraft both the Super Bowl logo and theme art for Super Bowl LIX. Following her debut as the first artist to create a Super Bowl logo, the NFL has unveiled Queen Tahj’s Super Bowl LIX theme art.

Look no further than the Super Bowl LIX logo, which was first presented way back in February 2024. As they are every year, the next year’s Super Bowl logos are unveiled the day after the championship game.
