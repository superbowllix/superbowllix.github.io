        <p>The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL. The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) – winning the last two. 
The Jets have won one Super Bowl in their only Super Bowl appearance. They won Super Bowl III in 1969 against the Baltimore Colts, who were the strong favorites to win the game. 
The Jets have not played in the Super Bowl since the merger, losing the AFC Championship Game in the 1982, 1998, 2009 and 2010 seasons. [72] On the other hand, the Colts won Super Bowl V (1970), then after relocating to Indianapolis, won Super Bowl XLI (2006) and lost Super Bowl XLIV (2009). [73] [74]

Today is January 12th, 1969: The New York Jets Win Super Bowl III. Act One. It’s December 28th, 1958 at Yankee Stadium in New York, eight years before the Green Bay Packers will win Super Bowl I. Tension is rising as the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts battle it out to be named champions of the National Football League, or NFL. 
Conclusion. Super Bowl III marked the first time that the AFL would win the championship in the season’s biggest football game.
