        <h2><strong>ice spice super bowl reddit what super bowl winner had the worst record</strong></h2>
        <p>Basically Ice Spice is a young rapper. She's African-American and Dominican. She's already been nominated for a Grammy. She's not super, super famous but after the Super Bowl on Sunday she got more attention. She's a friend of Taylor Swift and she went to the game with her. At one point a photo of Jason Kelce talking to Ice Spice was released. 
Okay buddy, explain the upside down cross neckless she held up Okay. We found higher-resolution images of Spice at the Super Bowl in which her pendant appears to be a Greek (equal-armed) cross, rather than an inverted one, although according to TMZ and other sources, the piece, designed by Alex Moss, was indeed an upside-down ‚Äî though not "satanic" ‚Äî cross.

While many fans tuned into the 2024 Super Bowl to see Taylor Swift cheer on Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, it was Ice Spice who stole the show with her confused reactions to the rules of football. 
Ice's presence in the VIP suite led to some of the night's funniest viral moments‚Äîmost notably, when Swift introduced her new bestie to Travis' brother, Philadelphia Eagle Jason Kelce. 
A photo of Taylor Swift with Ice Spice as she supported her boyfriend Travis Kelce during Sunday's Super Bowl LVIII has become a viral hit on social media and sparked a series of memes.. Following  
This recent Super Bowl win means that the Chiefs are back-to-back winners of the coveted NFL championship game after they won last year against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Ice Spice looks confused at Super Bowl. The 24-year-old rapper arrived at the NFL championship on Sunday alongside Swift and Blake Lively. The trio watched the game from Kelce's VIP suite, where  
She say ice spice , "what you doing?" (What) I can take a shit and they view it (click) You didn't think I could do it My farts are more revelant than you is I'd lose anythin' before my man I'm a pretty bitch I don't like fightin' On the beat I'm goin' Super Saiyan (grrah) I said, "Mirror, mirror, who the fairest?" (Huh?)

so a long time ago (late 2000s) at a once-in-a-lifetime weird music event, my friend and i watched Akon backstage doing what we could only assume was practicing poses for photographs. this was before like lives and videos were a thing so we watched him go through poses, taking photos with his phone, assuming he checked them to make sure he looked cool. 
Kim probably feels like Ice Spice owes her something since she had ice on north‚Äôs tik tok which promoted Ice a lot IMO. The Ice spice wig, pants that said juicy on the butt, and singing a sexual Ice Spice song. You just know that really pissed Kanye off. The tik tok Kanye rant was the only one I could relate to. 
No No incorrect The crowd wasn't booing because the twit was chugging her beer they were booing because I spice was throwing up satanic double signs with her hand and wearing an upside down cross pay attention That's why the crowd booed and she shook her head and disapproval because the crowd didn't approve of her satanic b***** and they shut it down right now. 
I mean, it's not paranoia to say Ice Spice is a satanist. Satinism is a religion with a lot of followers (especially in the music scene). Iowa even had a satanic temple in the Capital Building for a while last year. It's a thing. It's fine. The paranoia is believing satanists control the country. They don't. 
Got blocked by a person I went to high school with. Post was about Taylor Swift drinking at the Super Bowl and Ice Spice making ‚Äúsatanic hand gestures‚Äù. 
Also to give more context to understand the jokes. Jason Kelce is the older brother of Taylor Swift‚Äôs boyfriend Travis. Jason is recently retired future hall of fame football player in his own right but generally jokingly known as the more well meaning and even tempered of the two brothers if a bit of a fun-dopey super dad to his three daughters. 
this was the dumbest most predictable super bowl ever down to taylor swift chugging a beer and ice spice wearing an upside down cross flashing devil horns
