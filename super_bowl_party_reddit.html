        <h2><strong>super bowl party reddit super bowl restaurant owner</strong></h2>
        <p>A user asks for advice on hosting a super bowl party for 10 people, including drink, food and game ideas. See the comments for humorous and creative suggestions, such as topless waiters, prop bets, and homemade poop. 
A user asks what to bring to a Super Bowl party in America and gets various suggestions and opinions from other users. Some say beer or wine is fine, others say nothing or check with the host, and some joke about strippers or cocaine. 
Jalapeno popper cups. You get a premade flake biscuit, peel the layers and use one layer for each cup. Then make a spicy cream cheese filling to your taste and top with jalapeno slices. It's tried and true flavor but no one else will bring this. Alternatively ham, jalapeno and cheese wheels but that can be expensive for a big party.

The Super Bowl can drone on for hours. And people are going to be drinking. The less time you have people in your place, the less likely it is that people will have to sleep over. 
These Super Bowl food ideas aren’t overly complicated, and they prove that you can whip up a trophy-worthy feast without breaking the bank (or missing any of the commercials, if those are your thing). Add a few easy mixed drinks or beer cocktails to the mix, and it’ll be impossible to fumble your Super Bowl party. 
The Art of Whiskey – The Super Bowl Whiskey and Cigar Party The exclusive whiskey tasting event will feature a curated selection of premium whiskeys, carefully paired with cigars and food. 622  
Reddit is also loaded with Taylor-inspired party inspo. For food lovers, there's a Reddit thread that encourages people to share food puns/recipe ideas for a Super Bowl party inspired by the singer. 
Sports fans are gearing up for not just the Super Bowl and halftime show, but also the food associated with the annual event. Hot wings, pizza and multi-layered dip are among the country's  
The Super Bowl is an event that combines some of the best things our world has to offer — football, food, parties and, of course, sports betting. However, not everyone wants to bet at a sportsbook. A great alternative that can get everyone involved is downloading a 2025 printable Super Bowl props sheet. 
66 votes, 74 comments. true. This. A couple of tips though. First, mix some cheddar or monterey jack in with the cream cheese filling. 
EDIT: Looking at this thread, it appears there are two camps of nacho. The other camp is the liquid queso camp. The nachos above are more like a pull-apart chewy cheese like you find on pizza. I guess the only way to settle the debate is to bring both to a Super Bowl party. 
Anyone have any good homemade pools, other than squares, they do for super bowl parties they can share. I’ve done some where we throw players names in a hat and random pool for “first score”. If your player score you win the pot. 
Ehh not really, the game isn’t just on in the background. The game is definitely the main event, but it goes beyond just sports fans. Football is already a highly popular sport here, so most homes are throwing Super Bowl get togethers &amp; people who might never even watch football (like myself lol) will come to watch the game and enjoy the drinks/snacks 
I'd tell people bring something, personally I'm going to a big party I'm bringing 11 to 13 gallons of home brew a little over 11 gallons of which is easy drinking cream ale and 2 gallons of home made stout, then making beer grain soft pretzel sticks about 3 to 4 dozen to go with beer cheese to match. 
Food, drinks, set-up, etc. What are the things you think an authentic Super Bowl party needs to have? P.S. There aren't any NFL teams where I'm from so there's no real regional bias in terms of what team is supported here. 
You don’t go to a Super Bowl party and shit in the punch bowl because you’re upset the people are interested in football. That’s just being rude and childish. You don’t see sports people screaming out “acting!” during plays or calling for freebird at a child’s piano recital. 
We have a large Super Bowl party and found doing a bunch of pools is better than 1 box pool. Each pool is 10 guys. You pick a number randomly from a hat (zero thru 9). You add up the final score and use the last digit as the winner. So if the score is 27-14 then total is 41 and whoever has 1 is the winner. 
Looking for a Super Bowl party here in vegas. I have friends coming in to town. We want to be able to hear the game, big tv's and maybe a drink/food package. I've seen promotions for WestGate and Hard Rock, but haven't checked out the venues. Where are some good spots?! Thanks!
