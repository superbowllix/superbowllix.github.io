A comprehensive analysis of World Series television ratings, as compiled by Nielsen Media Research, along with broadcast network data, and shares for every Major League World Series where data is researched below. Television rates were first made available in 1968, and are current through the 2024 World Series. Research by Baseball Almanac. 
The highest ratings for an entire World Series is tied between 1978, featuring the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, and 1980, featuring the Philadelphia Phillies and Kansas City Royals. Both series went six games and averaged a rating of 32.8 and a share of 56. [ 5 ]

The final tally: World Series 234, Super Bowl 229, with Sunday's game yet to be played. While most of the early Super Bowls were dull, boring and full of turnovers, the last decade has witnessed  
This number is higher than the most watched Baseball game ever (1980 Phillies vs Royals game 6 at 54 million) combined with the most watched NBA game ever (Bulls/Jazz 1998 game 6 at 35m) In a more modern age Cubs/Indians game 7 World Series in 2016 was at 40 million and Game 7 Cavs/Warriors in 2016 was 30 million.
