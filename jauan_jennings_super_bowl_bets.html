        <h2><strong>jauan jennings super bowl bets news leaks super bowl matchup</strong></h2>
        <p>Jauan Jennings and the San Francisco 49ers will match up against the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl at 6:30 PM ET on Sunday. Let's break down Jennings' prop bets, stats and trends ahead of  
In his NFL career, Jennings has 78 catches for 963 yards and seven touchdowns over three seasons with the 49ers. Super Bowl betting markets offer hundreds of player props, and you can find a wide variety of Jauan Jennings props on legal US sportsbooks. Here is a look at our favorite Jauan Jennings Super Bowl 58 prop bets. 
Jauan Jennings will suit up as the WR3 for the 49ers on Super Bowl Sunday, but with the embarrassment of riches that San Francisco has at its skill positions, his usage may be limited once again. With lines set at 1.5 receptions and 14.5 receiving yards, bookmakers aren’t expecting Jennings to have any sort of prolific impact, but over

Jennings and the San Francisco 49ers (12-5) face the Kansas City Chiefs (11-6) in the Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada. Catch all the NFL action on DISH! Jauan Jennings Player  
Pick: Jauan Jennings Over 13.5 Receiving Yards (-105) Jauan Jennings' production has been sporadic, but for much of the season, he has been good for a long reception or two per game. Jennings started off the season with at least 19 yards in every game between Weeks 2-6. 
Jauan Jennings’ Receiving Trends. Jennings’ 33 targets have led to 19 receptions for 265 yards (20.4 per game) and one touchdown. Jennings averages 13.9 yards per catch (265 yards on 19 receptions) this season. Jennings has totaled 265 receiving yards and one receiving TD, ranking 156th and 159th, respectively, in the league. 
Chiefs vs 49ers Player Props: Super Bowl Bets Fading Justin Watson &amp; Jauan Jennings. To find both of these Chiefs vs 49ers player props on DraftKings, go to the "Receiving Props" section and scroll all the way down to the bottom. 
Kelce is the most-bet player to win Super Bowl MVP (19%) at BetMGM, according to John Ewing. One bettor has a $10K wager on Kelce to take home the hardware at +1300 odds. Again, this should come as a surprise to no one with the Taylor Swift effect that has followed Kelce all season showing up for Super Bowl 58. 
Sleeper Prop Picks: Jauan Jennings Receiving Yards. Next up in our Super Bowl sleeper props is Jauan Jennings. There’s a real chance Jennings doesn’t see much of the ball behind the likes Deebo Samual, Brandon Aiyuk, George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey. But that’s what makes him a good Super Bowl sleeper bet. 
49ers wide receiver Jauan Jennings passed for a touchdown in Super Bowl 58 — a double screen pass that went for a 21-yard score to Christian McCaffrey. Two years before that, Bengals running back Joe Mixon threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Tee Higgins. 
49ers ATTD Scorer Bets WR Jauan Jennings While Samuel and Aiyuk are priced lower than 2-1 to score, I’m looking for another receiver option. Jennings receives prized targets in the ATTD market, with his season-long aDOT at 11.0 yards, but three times this season, it exceeded 20 yards. 
No. 5: Passing Touchdown From A Non-QB. Of the four Super Bowl prop bets mentioned in this piece, this one pays the best, at +1000. That means a $100 bet would profit $1,000 (total payout of $1,100). 
Bet This Pick: Eagles (-102) Super Bowl 59 Game Prop: A Non-QB to Throw a Passing TD (+1300) We’ve got a fun little trend brewing in the Super Bowl — non-quarterbacks slinging touchdowns, and I’m cashing in. San Francisco’s Jauan Jennings just cashed in during Super Bowl 58, hitting Christian McCaffrey on a 21-yard dime off a double screen. 
Jauan Jennings Super Bowl MVP +30000. This is less of a bad beat and more of a just-missed huge payday. Before Sunday's game, Jauan Jennings was a 300-1 longshot to win Super Bowl MVP on ESPN BET

We’re not sure we agree with the sentiment that Jauan Jennings would have been going to Disneyland as the Super Bowl MVP but his impact on the game was undeniable. In the second quarter, Brock Purdy threw a quick lateral to Jennings at the 28-yard line of Kansas City with Jenning’s momentum carrying him back to the 32.
