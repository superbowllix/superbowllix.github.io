Mahomes will aim to become the first quarterback of a three-time defending Super Bowl champion; Hurts will seek to win his first Lombardi Trophy after arguably outplaying Mahomes in a loss on the  
2025 Super Bowl: Chiefs and Eagles ranked by tiers with shot at Hall of Fame; two locks at the top  Super Bowls define quarterbacks more than any other position. If Hurts is able to win Sunday  
He is The Other Quarterback in Super Bowl 2025, if only because he isn’t the one 60 minutes from a three-peat. Hurts is the one who has been chasing this chance to win that elusive ring for  
The Eagles entered the season 11-1 to win the Super Bowl and +550 to win the NFC. They were tied for the second favorites to win the NFC entering the season with the Lions, trailing the 49ers (+260). 
Denver’s Sean Payton (179 wins) and Carroll (181) have combined for 360 additional wins, with both winning Super Bowl titles. Jim Harbaugh of the Chargers has a .685 winning percentage in five seasons as an NFL head coach, with one Super Bowl trip and a college national championship. 
Editor’s note: This post has been updated with new information. With the 2025 Super Bowl on the way, we’ll soon know if a new NFL quarterback will join the eternal list of Super Bowl champions. 
Patrick Mahomes is trying to lead the Kansas City Chiefs to an unprecedented Super Bowl three-peat. He needs only to beat the Philadelphia Eagles to achieve that goal and win his fourth career  
Only Burrow has been to a Super Bowl and he also lost. Hurts is the first quarterback to go back to the big game after losing his first time since Jim Kelly, who lost four in a row with the Bills

Both quarterbacks illustrate the importance of game management and adaptability, showing that success isn't solely measured in yards or touchdowns. As they head into Super Bowl LIX, their contrasting styles highlight the evolving quarterback role, where making plays isn't just about the arm but also executing strategies that lead to victories. 
A fourth Super Bowl win would tie Mahomes with Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the second-most Super Bowl wins by a quarterback. Mahomes' 17 postseason wins are already the  
Prisco's 2025 Super Bowl pick: In Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs we trust; QB leads game-winning drive vs. Eagles Pete Prisco isn't picking against Mahomes and the back-to-back champs

The 59th Super Bowl will be on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, in New Orleans. Kickoff will be at 6:30 p.m. EST. Super Bowl 59:Chiefs, Eagles, Taylor Swift, date and time, everything you need to know Where
