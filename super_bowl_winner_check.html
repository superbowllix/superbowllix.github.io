        <p>Do Winners of the Super Bowl Get Paid Extra? It’s true: Winners of every Super Bowl also make an extra paycheck and receive a unique ring for that game. In terms of the paycheck, it’s substantial. The winner of Super Bowl LIX will receive a bonus worth $171,000. The loser will receive $96,000. 
Under the NFL's current collective bargaining agreement (Article 37, Section 5), each player on the winning team in Super Bowl 59 will receive a bonus of $171,000. That's a $7,000 increase over

Back in the first Super Bowl, the winner was paid $15,000, and the loser $7,500. However, when adjusted for inflation, that equates to roughly $117,000 and $59,000 in 2022. Therefore, the change in pay for playing in or winning the Super Bowl has not increased so substantially over the years relative to the current market. 
According to the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement, each eligible player on the Chiefs’ roster will receive a check for $164,000 for being on the winning team in the Super Bowl.

The bonus associated with playing in the Super Bowl grows each year, according to the agreement. Last year the winners’ bonus was $157,000. Next year, it’s set to rise to $171,000. By the 2030-31 football season (the last seasons covered in the most recent bargaining agreement), the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000. 
Read below to see the bonuses handed out to each player on the winning and losing teams beginning with the first Super Bowl. 1967 to 1976 Jan. 15, 1967 - Green Bay 35, Kansas City 10 Winner: $15,000 Loser: $7,500 Jan. 14, 1968 - Green Bay 33, Oakland 14 Winner: $15,000 Loser: $7,500 Jan. 12, 1969 - New York 16, Baltimore 7 Winner: $15,000 Loser  
The 2023 Super Bowl winners earned $164,000, while members of the winning team in 2022 received $157,000—so you can see it goes up a bit each year. This year's cash bonus is up more than $40,000 from 2020, when the winners of the Super Bowl each took home $130,000. 
Super Bowl winner: $164,000 Super Bowl loser: $89,000 If the Chiefs win the 2024 Super Bowl, players collecting the full amount of every bonus check will have earned an extra $338,000.

FORT WORTH, Texas – One semiaquatic mammal at the Fort Worth Zoo made quite a splash Thursday, Feb. 6, by predicting that the Kansas City Chiefs will win Super Bowl LIX this Sunday. Approximately 9 feet long and 2,332 pounds, Bubbles the hippopotamus is roughly seven times heavier than your average offensive lineman. 
With Super Bowl ticket prices routinely hitting $1,000+ today, it might be a bit shocking to know that Super Bowl I failed to sell out, with more than 30,000 empty seats at kickoff. </p>
