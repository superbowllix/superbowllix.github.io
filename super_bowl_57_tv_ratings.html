Super Bowl LIX could get ratings boost from Nielsen out-of-home viewership expansion Nielsen's out-of-home viewership now covers 100 percent of the U.S. population, up from 66 percent a year ago. 
An average audience of 114.21 million viewers in the US tuned in to watch Super Bowl LVII with ratings rising to 123.4 million viewers last year’s game between the Chiefs and the 49ers.
