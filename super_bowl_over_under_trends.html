        <h2><strong>super bowl over under trends super bowl stray kids romanized</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl betting trends show tight ATS &amp; O/U results Favorites are 28-28-2 in the 58 Super Bowls that have been contested. The UNDER is 29-28 in Super Bowl betting history. 
However, over the last 12 Super Bowls, the AFC has gone 9-3 ATS (75%) and 8-4 SU (66.7%). The NFC teams to cover in that span were the 2013 Seahawks, the 2017 Eagles and the 2020 Tampa Bay  
The over/under for Super Bowl LIX opened at 49.5, but fell to 48.5, indicating bettors piled in on the under. The only Super Bowl that exceeded the total in the past six games was the 38-35  
Super Bowl Over/Under Trends. If the Super Bowl 59 total remains at 49.5 or moves higher, it will be the 16 th time in Super Bowl history that the total lands at 49.5 or higher. That outcome would bode well for under bettors. In the previous 15 instances the total was 49.5 or higher, the under is 10-5-0. 
For OVER/UNDER bets, a total point threshold is set, such as the 49.5 total point mark for Super Bowl LIX. Bettors predict whether the combined score of both teams will be OVER or UNDER this number. The UNDER has hit in five of the last six Super Bowls. 
The San Francisco 49ers were 2.5-point favorites over the Kansas City Chiefs for Super Bowl 58 and the Over/Under total was 47.5. Where will Super Bowl 59 be played? 
However, these teams also have two of the best defenses in the NFL, making this year’s Super Bowl Over/Under an intriguing betting market worth digging into. Chiefs Over/Under Trends 
Super Bowl ATS and Over/Under Trends There are eight NFL franchises who have won back-to-back Super Bowls: the Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and now Kansas City Chiefs – the latter is attempting to three-peat, which has never been done before. 
49ers vs. Chiefs odds have been available for nearly two weeks, so the sample size of Super Bowl betting trends data is now large enough to provide insight regarding how the market is approaching the spread and over/under. Super Bowl odds have seen very little movement since early last week, but examining where the action is going can help us  
Super Bowl totals have an all-time tally of 29-28 Over/Under, and this year’s is sitting at 48.5 O/U. When these two teams met in Super Bowl LVII, they combined for 73 points, easily going over  
Super Bowl LIX Player Prop Betting Trends Patrick Mahomes Super Bowl Props: Passing Trends. Patrick Mahomes' Passing Yardage Prop: 251.5 (over -110) Over in 9 of 18 overall games; Over in 7 of 12 games with DeAndre Hopkins; Over in 2 of 4 games with Marquise Brown; Current Prop Odds: 
* Concerning Super Bowl totals, in the 57 games that had posted numbers, Over is 39-18 (68.4%) and Under is 38-18-1 (67.9%) on 6-point teasers. For the 2024 game, both Over and Under teaser bettors won handily. 
Heading into Super Bowl 59, the over has cashed in 4 straight Super Bowls and in 5 of the last 6. Country singer Reby McEntire sang the national anthem last year and it clocked in at a prompt 1:35. The anthem does typically come in at around 2 minutes, and a lot of what can determine whether the national anthem goes over or under is how long  
Over/Under Super Bowl Trends The Eagles have one of the best scoring offenses in the NFL and the second-best rushing offense. The team has been fantastic under their new star running back, Saquon Barkley. 
Super Bowl LIII was a defensive struggle, with the New England Patriots defeating the Los Angeles Rams. The over/under for this game was approximately 57.5. The final score was a low-scoring 13-3, resulting in a total of just 16 points. This was a resounding win for the “under.” Super Bowl Over Unders: Analyzing the Trends 
49ers Over/Under Trends. The 49ers have seen more high-scoring games this season, hitting the Over in 11 of their 19 games (58%). That’s due in large part to Purdy’s solid play. 
In this post, we’ll look at historical data trends regarding team performance against the Super Bowl over/under line (also known as the game total or total points line). While you always need to be cautious when it comes to trend-based analysis, this information can be helpful for making an over/under pick for Super Bowl LVIII in 2024  
Super Bowl betting trends show tight ATS and O/U results. Favorites are 28-27-2 in the 57 Super Bowls that have been contested. The OVER and UNDER are deadlocked at 28-28 in Super Bowl betting
