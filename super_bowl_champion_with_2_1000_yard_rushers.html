        <p>Jackson broke Vick's single season record for most rushing yards by a quarterback [10] as well as Dunn's record for the most rushing yards of a member of a 1,000-yard rushing duo. The 1978 Chicago Bears came the closest to having a 1000-yard duo without succeeding, when Walter Payton finished with 1,305 yards but Roland Harper fell 8 yards  
The rushing game isn't what it used to be in the NFL. Short passes have taken over where running backs used to have to plow through the trenches to gain critical yards. Who are the running backs who have rushed for 1,000 yards in the regular season on teams that won the Super Bowl since the 2000 regular season? 
He scored 12 touchdowns, rushed for 1,381 yards, and recorded a team-leading 87 receptions for 1,048 yards. In all, Faulk gained a record 2,429 total yards and became just the second running back in NFL history to gain over 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season (Roger Craig was the first to do it, in 1985).

The Hall of Fame running back had just 40 rushing yards in the Dolphins' 24-3 loss to Dallas at Super Bowl VI, but helped Miami finish off a perfect 1972 with 112 yards in a 14-7 Super Bowl win  
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
A consensus All-American at Syracuse and the Dolphins’ No.1 draft pick in 1968, Csonka contributed almost picture-perfect performances in Miami's three Super Bowl seasons in 1971, 1972 and 1973. He surpassed 1,000 yards in rushing all three seasons with his best production – 1,117 yards – coming during Miami's perfect season in 1972. 
Both the 1972 Dolphins and 1976 Steelers played 14-game regular season schedules, while the 1985 Browns, 2006 Falcons, 2008 Giants, 2009 Panthers, and 2019 Ravens played 16-game regular season schedules. And only the 1972 Dolphins were able to parlay their rushing success into a Super Bowl championship. 
The NFL Immaculate Grid has given fans one of the tougher connections to make among players. It asked about Super Bowl champions who've had a 1,000-yard rushing season in their career. 
The 100-yard running games are far from prevalent in Super Bowls. In fact, a lot of games see the leading rusher with far less yardage than one might expect. Super Bowl 1 
The last Super Bowl champion with a 1,000-yard rusher was LeGarrette Blount with the 2016 Patriots. The six-season drought without one is tied for the longest in NFL history (1966-71). There were  
12 of the last 15 Super Bowl winning teams won without a 1,000 yard rusher. This is the SB winning team and their leading rusher that season. 2022 Chiefs - Isiah Pacheco with 830 yards 
Let’s take a look at the New England Patriots 1000-yard rushers in their history as the team seems ready to adopt a ground-and-pound offense. An article not too long ago by sister site Musket  
Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier each hit the K-mark for the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers in 1976, and Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack each ran for 1,000 yards for Cleveland in 1985. George  
All-Time Rushing Yards Leaders For some seasons (1960-1969 &amp; 1947-1950) leaders for both leagues are shown. + Indicates Hall of Famer, season age in parentheses 
That means Blount, on the ’16 Patriots, is the last such player to rush for 1,000 yards and win the Super Bowl in the same season. In fact, just 3 of the last 13 Super Bowl champions (including whoever wins Super Bowl LV) had 1,000 yard rushers: Ray Rice on the 2012 Ravens, Marshawn Lynch on the ’13 Seahawks, and Blount on the ’16 Patriots. 
Csonka, the Hall of Fame fullback, led the Dolphins in rushing with 1,117 yards on 213 carries and scored 6 TDs. Meanwhile, Morris rushed for an even 1,000 yards and scored a then-club record 12 touchdowns. By doing so, Csonka and Morris became the first set of runners from the same team to rush for 1,000 yards in the same season. 
That didn’t stop him from gaining 1,364 yards as a rookie and winning a world championship after rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown in Super Bowl XXXV. He became the youngest player ever (at 21 years, 155 days) to win a title. Then, during training camp in 2001, Lewis tore his ACL and missed the entire year. </p>
