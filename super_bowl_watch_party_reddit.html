        <p>Wife and I driving up for the weekend, will watch the game from a watch party. Looking at Biggest Big Game Bash 2024 - Downtown Las Vegas Events Center (dlvec.com) but all the 4 seaters are sold out. 
Orleans has a watch party in Mardi gra ballroom for between $250-$350 all you can eat and drink I believe, Westgate has Big Game party in a banquet room for about $275 all you can eat and halftime raffles . I’ve seen a lot of pictures and YouTube videos of the one at Westgate but no reviews or videos of the Orleans and watch party.

20 Tailgates, Watch Parties, and Buffets for Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas The ultimate guide to all the tailgates and game day watch parties for the big game by Ryan Slattery Updated Feb 6, 2024  
Super Bowl watch parties typically focus on the big game and the commercials. But this year, the Taylor Swift effect is a big draw, too. If you find yourself suddenly hosting a Super Bowl party  
Catch the action of the Strip and Super Bowl when you party at Paris Las Vegas’ rooftop bar and restaurant, Beer Park. Enjoy open bar, tray-passed hors d’oeuvres and a picnic-style, backyard  
Where can I watch it? The Pennsylvania Convention Center is hosting a free Fan Fest for Verizon subscribers, starting at 4 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday. The event includes food, drink and games, and  
Old Town Pub in Bordentown, Burlington County, will host a Super Bowl watch party that includes two rounds of buffets. A cash bar and drink specials will also be available. It costs $25 to attend. 
The Art of Whiskey – The Super Bowl Whiskey and Cigar Party The exclusive whiskey tasting event will feature a curated selection of premium whiskeys, carefully paired with cigars and food. 622  
For example the Plaza downtown has sold almost 800 for their big party and about 230 for the VIP party! ALL hotel casinos have parties BTW. I'll be at my cozy neighborhood bar : ) 
I am hosting a super bowl party for about 10 people. I wanted some tips on drink ideas like cocktails and non alcoholic drinks. I also have some friends who don’t really watch football but want them to have a good time so any party game ideas? Food suggestions are welcomed I was thinking pizza and wings with chips and dips too. 
Any place with tickets for guaranteed seats left? Cost really isn’t an issue unless &gt;$250/person. SO and I flying into Philly on Saturday and have an airbnb right near broad street center city, but are late to the party regarding watch party plans. We aren’t planning on drinking a ton, just need a place with seats and food available

My group that I watch the games with buy a bottle of alcohol the year any of the older group members pass. Each Super Bowl we haul around a crate of alcohol labeled for each passed member of our group with hopes of pouring out some on their graves. This will be the year that everyone’s thirst will be quenched. 
Hello reddit. I just move to Berkeley. What are your recommendations to go and watch the super bowl tomorrow? From street viewing to high end bars/lounge. 
If you are charging for tickets to get in they may have an issue but if you are just thinking of renting a rec centre or inviting people to your house and hosting a party then there is no difference between that and a Super Bowl party. TLDR; don’t charge for it and it’s no different from a Super Bowl party. 
OK, I didn't crash the party, but I felt out-of-place and came away with feelings of unease. My wife and I were invited to her parent's house for the super bowl. We had no plans and, in an honest attempt to follow sound etiquette, we accepted the invitation outright, unaware and unconcerned with the other guests that would be attending. 
Where are you guys/girls going to watch the Super Bowl in the South Bay? I was thinking of San Pedro but I wanted to see if there are any other good
