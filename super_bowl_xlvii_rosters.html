Mercedes-Benz Superdome following Super Bowl XLVII. This was the 49ers' second Super Bowl played at the Superdome—the first being Super Bowl XXIV when they beat the Denver Broncos 55–10. The 49ers, Broncos and New England Patriots are the only teams so far to play two or more Super Bowls at the Superdome. The 49ers also joined the Broncos

The 49ers failed to get that sixth Super Bowl win that would have tied them with the Steelers for the most Super Bowls ever; they’d get another chance seven years later.
