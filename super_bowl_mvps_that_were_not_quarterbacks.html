        <p>33 of the 59 players who’ve been named Super Bowl MVP were quarterbacks; Tom Brady was responsible for five of them and is one of the six QBs who comprise the entirety of the list of players who’ve won it at least twice while accounting for 17 of the awards that have been handed out. 
Quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl MVP award in 33 of the prior 58 Super Bowls. A total of 26 non-quarterbacks have been awarded Super Bowl MVP, including 15 offensive players, 10 defensive  
Larry Csonka dominated Super Bowl VIII, rushing for a then-record 145 yards on 33 carries and scoring two touchdowns. His powerful running style overwhelmed the Vikings’ defense, leading the Dolphins to a 24-7 victory and their second consecutive championship. Csonka became the first running back to win Super Bowl MVP. 7. Von Miller, LB  
Quarterbacks may hog the Super Bowl MVP spotlight, but these legends bucked the trend, proving that football is a team game. From dominant defenders to game-breaking receivers, here’s a look at  
It’s become customary for quarterbacks to win Super Bowl MVP, as 12 of the last 20 Super Bowl MVPs have indeed been quarterbacks. Who were the non-quarterbacks to take home the coveted Super Bowl MVP trophy? When in doubt, the quarterback gets the glory and that’s been the case with Super Bowl MVP recipients.

Carr Trophy (MVP) Bert Bell Award (Player of the Year) AAFC MVP; Super Bowl MVP; Walter Payton Man of the Year; NFLPA Alan Page Community Award; AP Offensive Player of the Year  
Explore the exceptional performances of non-quarterbacks who secured the Super Bowl MVP, breaking the quarterback-centric tradition and leaving an indelible mark on the grandest stage in American  
Bart Starr was the MVP of Super Bowls I and II while quarterback for the Green Bay Packers Joe Montana won three Super Bowl MVP awards as quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers Jerry Rice, the MVP of Super Bowl XXIII, played wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers Desmond Howard, MVP of Super Bowl XXXI with the Green Bay Packers, is the only special teams player – a kick/punt returner  
One of the most notable exceptions to the quarterback dominance in MVP awards occurred in the 1970s. For the first and only time, the Super Bowl MVP was awarded to a defensive player from the

The Super Bowl MVP has also been an offensive award; just nine of the 58 winners were defensive players. Von Miller is the last non-offensive player to receive the honor, doing so with the Denver

Barkley is without a doubt the most likely non-quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP and the running back is currently priced at +260 with most USA bookmakers to take home the award. It is very rare that any player has better odds than either starting quarterback at the Super Bowl, but Barkley is priced significantly lower than teammate Jalen  
Our list of the 20 greatest Super Bowl quarterbacks of all time is not purely based on talent and  Elway was named MVP in Super Bowl XXIII a  Even Brady's Super Bowl losses were memorable.  
Bills quarterback Josh Allen, who won the AP MVP award, speaks during the NFL Honors award show on Feb. 6, 2025 ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl battle between the Chiefs and Eagles. 
Jackson is the only quarterback to win the MVP award since Brian Sipe of the Cleveland Browns in 1980 who has never played in a Super Bowl. Jackson is also the only player with multiple MVP awards  
Yet, the BYU graduate rose to the occasion, seamlessly filling the void and securing two MVP awards along with a Super Bowl MVP during his eight-year tenure as the franchise’s leader. Beyond his proficiency as a passer, Young claims the sixth position among quarterbacks in all-time career rushing yards, amassing 4,239 yards. 
We don’t know who will be the NFL MVP this coming season but based on the history of the award we can assume it will go to a QB. Because since 1957 it has gone to 42 QBs and and just 18 non-QBs (Jim Brown won it three times).
