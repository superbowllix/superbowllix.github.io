        <h2><strong>eagles super bowl qbs super bowl iii trophy</strong></h2>
        <p>Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have been led to the Super Bowl by Jalen Hurts. Every QB the Eagles have had has not been as successful as their current one. A look at the quarterbacks who started the most games each season for Philly since the Super Bowl began. 
Eagles reserve lists. The Eagles have a handful of injured players on their roster who will not be able to participate in Super Bowl 59. Below is a look at the athletes whose season has already ended. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
Super Bowl QBs tale of the tape: Jalen Hurts vs. Patrick Mahomes as Eagles rematch Chiefs in NFL championship  At 26, he's already the first Eagles quarterback to ever reach two Super Bowls in  
Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
Donovan McNabb is the only other QB to pay in the Super Bowl for the Eagles this century, but the PFF list doesn't go back to the 2004 season. Even if it did, McNabb wouldn't be among the top five. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
Won Super Bowl 41-33 vs. New England Patriots. Offensive Coordinator: Frank Reich. Defensive Coordinator: Jim Schwartz. Other Notable Asst.: John DeFilippo (Quarterbacks), Ken Flajole (Linebackers), Mike Groh (Wide Receivers), Press Taylor (Off. Quality Control/Asst. Quarterbacks) and Cory Undlin (Defensive Backs) Stadium: Lincoln Financial Field 
Instead, the Eagles grew frustrated with the Randall Cunninghams, Donovan McNabbs and Carson Wentzs of the world – quarterbacks who would get them close to the Super Bowl, but never close enough  
The upstart Eagles star was right: Only seven other Black quarterbacks have taken the Super Bowl stage as starters since the big game's inception at the end of the 1966 season. 
Eagles QB Jalen Hurts is entering a territory that most NFL quarterbacks never reach. He will be starting in his second Super Bowl in three years and is doing so at the young age of 26. Super Bowl LIX will be a rematch of Super Bowl LVII, two seasons ago when these two teams faced off, and the game ended with a Chiefs victory. The Eagles are  
His 119.2 passer rating from 2013 is 4 th-highest in NFL history (behind Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and 2020 and Peyton Manning in 2004), his 9.1 yards per attempt is 12 th-highest in history, his 14.2 yards per completion is 6 th-highest in the last 30 years, his touchdown percentage — one TD every 11.7 attempts — is 12 th-highest in NFL history and his interception percentage – one every  
In Super Bowl 2023, Philadelphia Eagles QB Jalen Hurts threw for more yards than Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes (304-182) in Kansas City's 38-35 victory.If you want to bet that happening again, DraftKings makes Hurts a +170 underdog to have more passing yards than Mahomes (-235) in Super Bowl LIX. 
Backup quarterback Nick Foles was named Super Bowl MVP. The Eagles defeated both Super Bowl teams from the previous NFL season (the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons) in the playoffs, the third team to beat both of them this season, after the Carolina Panthers and Miami Dolphins. 
Thanks to a masterful performance from quarterback Jalen Hurts, the Philadelphia Eagles are heading back to the Super Bowl.. Hurts ran for three touchdowns and passed for another as the Eagles  
When Super Bowl 59 kicks off, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will become one of just two active players to start in multiple Super Bowls, joining his counterpart, Patrick Mahomes. The two signal  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. </p>
