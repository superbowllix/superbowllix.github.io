        <p>Kanye is said to 'have poured everything' into his commercial this year, despite the clip being filmed in selfie-mode in the backseat of a car. He is said to have spent $7 million on his Super Bowl slot, in which he plugged his clothing line , Yeezy , and his upcoming album, Vultures.

In a screenshot uploaded to Instagram, Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) revealed he sold 260,000 pairs of his “Yeezy Pod” shoes and other apparel items between Sunday night and Monday morning, earning $19.3 million off a 30-second Super Bowl ad that cost the rapper $7 million. Ye just sold 266 000 Yeezy Pods in 1 day 
Investment vs. Outcome: Kanye West's approach, spending $7 million on a Super Bowl slot with a $0 production budget, challenges the conventional wisdom of high expenditure equating to high quality. 
Early in 2024, Kanye did a Super Bowl commercial that most considered odd. However, it generated close to 300,000 sales, which came close to generating $20 million, which was a $13 million profit
