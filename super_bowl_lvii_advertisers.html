        <p>During Super Bowl LVII, advertisers for Fox Nation, Netflix (teamed up with GM), Paramount+, and Tubi collectively ran 3.5 minutes of ads. While Netflix rolled out its Will-Ferrell-featured ad, it’s also dealing with early growing pains from its decision to launch an ad-supported tier for the first time since its founding more than two  
Super Bowl LVII aired Sunday Feb. 12, 2023 and featured dozens of commercials advertising products and showcasing new movies and television shows. The commercials also featured many celebrity  
Economic woes have weighed on media budgets in recent months, but that hasn’t dampened marketing excitement for Super Bowl LVII. Fox had already sold the lion’s share of its ad inventory by early September, with 30-second spots for the Feb. 12 broadcast reportedly going for a record $7 million. 
Super Bowl 57 Ad Tracker: Reviews and Video for all the 2023 Commercials A frequently updated look at the advertisers in Super Bowl LVII Fox will broadcast Super Bowl LVII on Feb. 12, 2023. 
Creative: As part of its Super Bowl spot, Limit Break will give away 40,000 NFTs and feature a QR code in its ad. The free token release is meant to build excitement for the company’s upcoming  
Super Bowl LVII will take place on February 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona in the new year, and advertising plans are already starting to take shape. As brands gear up for advertising’s biggest night of the year, inventory is selling out. 
The Philadelphia Eagles will take on the Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LVII on February 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Brands are gearing up for advertising’s biggest night and dropping hints and teasers in the lead up to the big game where ads are going for up to $7 million for :30 seconds, according to reports. 
According to our data, advertisers spent 35% more YoY on Super Bowl LVI than they did for Super Bowl LV. At the same time, the number of brands investing in this advertising gold jumped by 10% YoY. While most people steer clear of goods and services that increase by an exuberant amount in perpetuity, a select group of advertisers refuses to  
Super Bowl LVII has come and gone, but advertisers are still examining all of the Big Game commercials. A total of 54 spots dropped on Super Bowl Sunday (airing whistle-to-whistle, excluding movie trailers and TV show promos). 
With Super Bowl LVII kicking off Sunday comes another round of new and returning brands advertising during the game. A big storyline around this year’s crop of ads is Anheuser-Busch InBev giving up its alcohol category exclusivity for Super Bowl advertising, which it had held since 1988. 
Super Bowl 2023 Creative Effectiveness Report We took an in-depth look at the performance of all national ads that ran during Super Bowl LVII based on three core measures of ad effectiveness in our Link AI platform, as well as in-game advertising trends, digital activations, and a breakdown of who is watching the Big Game. 
Super Bowl LVII will take place on February 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona in the new year, and advertising plans are already starting to take shape. As brands gear up for advertising’s biggest night of the year, inventory is selling out. 
But those figures just scratch the surface of the stories surrounding this year’s Super Bowl from an audience and advertising perspective. iSpot’s new Super Bowl LVII TV Ad Report dives into every major takeaway, from minute-by-minute ad impressions, to key moments and creative trends and learnings including what motivates viewers to tune  
Year after year, marketers view Super Bowl advertising as an early indication of trends that will define the rest of the year. With Apple Music replacing Pepsi as a sponsor of the Halftime Show after 10 years, and Anheuser-Busch InBev dropping its alcohol advertising exclusivity after 33 years, the industry is particularly excited to see how things will play out. 
The Super Bowl for decades has served as advertising’s flashiest night of the year, drawing a slew of brands to craft witty, often star-studded commercials — Super Bowl LVII being no different. This year, however, social media marketing surrounding the game proved to stand on its own when compared to more traditional creative ploys  
Super Bowl LVII was full of celebrity appearances, tech brands and humor that sought to court Gen Z. We’re speaking of the ads, of course — not the game. While 60% of Super Bowl viewers tuned in to watch the game, and 20% were watching for Rihanna’s halftime show, 14% were mainly there for the ads. We saw similar figures for the 2022 game. 
The Super Bowl isn’t just the biggest event of football season — it’s the biggest event for advertising as well. Instead of solely relying on a 30-second spot during the big game, more and more brands are incorporating social campaigns into their Super Bowl advertising strategies. 
Super-high hopes Brand partnerships are a major advertising trend this year, beyond the always-popular celebrity cameo.. Molson Coors Beverage Co.'s first Super Bowl ad in more than three decades will feature a collaboration with DraftKings, giving consumers a chance to earn money by predicting certain contents of the commercial, such as the total number of beers featured. 
Last year, approximately 200 million people tuned in for Super Bowl LVII. That's a lot of eyes for any company and explains why advertisers have already scooped up all the game-day inventory
