        <h2><strong>cerave super bowl commercial agency super bowl appearance records</strong></h2>
        <p>This week, a website featuring Cera and the tagline “Human skin is his passion” rolled out, as did a teaser video for what some people correctly predicted to be CeraVe’s first-ever Super Bowl commercial. 
CeraVe's first Super Bowl ad featured actor Michael Cera, who playfully claimed to be the mastermind behind the brand's creation. Courtesy of CeraVe Campaign Trail is our analysis of some of the best new creative efforts from the marketing world. 
Transcending traditional Super Bowl ads, the first-of-its-kind "Michael CeraVe" campaign tapped into CeraVe's cultural relevancy to create a 360-degree influencer-first campaign fueled by the 
The L’Oréal brand’s first Super Bowl campaign, developed by WPP and led by agency Ogilvy, has taken an unconventional route involving bizarre public appearances by Cera, rumors circulating on 
These events led to the epic conclusion of the Michael CeraVe marketing campaign – a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl (and an extended version as well). The ad featuring Cera was satirical, over-the-top and dramatic, ending with the reveal that Micheal Cera is pitching his ad idea to a team of dermatologists. 
CeraVe’s Super Bowl campaign cut through the slog of pre-game teasers and trailers by amplifying paid media with earned media. The multichannel rollout included headline-grabbing Instagram videos, paparazzi photos, influencer unboxings and podcast appearances. 
So for Super Bowl 58, skincare brand CeraVe found its perfect partner: the aptly-named actor, Michael Cera. Known for his stilted comedy style from roles in ‘Superbad’, ‘Scott Pilgrim vs. the World’ and ‘Barbie’, the Canadian star’s chemistry with the brand goes beyond their nominative similarity. 
In the days leading up to the Big Game, Cera went toe-to-toe with dermatologists and revealed his own Michael CeraVe commercial to ‘prove’ he’s the master behind CeraVe. The truth came out during the Super Bowl-aired TV commercial, with Cera’s claims debunked by a boardroom of CeraVe dermatologists. Thank you. 
There are three main reasons that the CeraVe commercial took home the hardware, but ultimately it came down to one. They hired a proven agency, Ogilvy, to develop a strategy that would help 
As the players battled it out in overtime, it was the commercials that won over the audience, and Ogilvy North America’s ad for CeraVe beat a tough crowd to win the 2024 Super Clio Award, a special honor given out by the Clio Awards for the most creative commercial to air during the Super Bowl. 
Skincare brand CeraVe made its Super Bowl debut this year with the help of WPP Onefluence, a bespoke WPP agency team led by Ogilvy PR in North America. After rumours had spread about the real mastermind of the CeraVe brand following public sightings and videos on social media of celebrity Michael Cera, the L'Oréal team set the record straight  
And 30% of our agency agrees that the “Well Said” spot was the clear winner this year. With its text-only ad, the spot proved that Disney’s powerful stories can be recognized even without traditional branding and imagery. 
CeraVe and Ogilvy centered the Super Bowl influencer push around four key creators: Caleb Simpson, who’s amassed nearly 8 million TikTok followers by asking people how much they pay for rent and  
Doritos brought back “Crash the Super Bowl” to commemorate the brand’s 25th year running an ad during the Big Game, Tina Mahal, senior VP of marketing at PepsiCo Foods North America (the  
Unilever’s Dove and L’Oréal’s CeraVe both used WPP’s Ogilvy for Super Bowl ads, and Dove tries a P&amp;G shop, too. 
The CeraVe ad shows how a Super Bowl campaign isn’t just a one-off ad; it’s an extended campaign. Ogilvy’s desire to show up in culture and big moments also involves creativity and impact. 
&amp;quot;The truth has been hiding in plain sight,&amp;quot; actor Michael Cera says as he holds up a tub of CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. Mysterious and otherworldly music swells in the opaque, curtain-lined room, highlighting an undercurrent of whispering yet somehow distant romance. Michael IS CeraVe, and this is HIS cream. Human skin and the sheer rock face of a looming cliff will feel the hydrating
