        <p>Do Winners of the Super Bowl Get Paid Extra? It’s true: Winners of every Super Bowl also make an extra paycheck and receive a unique ring for that game. In terms of the paycheck, it’s substantial. The winner of Super Bowl LIX will receive a bonus worth $171,000. The loser will receive $96,000. 
The Kansas City Chiefs are looking to make history in Super Bowl 59. They could become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive titles, which would augment their legacy as one of the  
Players from the team that wins Super Bowl LVII (57) in State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona (Phoenix area), on Feb. 12, 2023, will get $157,000 along with the rest of the spoils that come with  
Those numbers also go up each season, maxing out at $228,000 bonuses for winning the Super Bowl in 2031, according to the league. Take a look at all the celebrities who showed up during Super Bowl  
Back in the first Super Bowl, the winner was paid $15,000, and the loser $7,500. However, when adjusted for inflation, that equates to roughly $117,000 and $59,000 in 2022. Therefore, the change in pay for playing in or winning the Super Bowl has not increased so substantially over the years relative to the current market. 
The 2023 Super Bowl winners earned $164,000, while members of the winning team in 2022 received $157,000—so you can see it goes up a bit each year. This year's cash bonus is up more than $40,000 from 2020, when the winners of the Super Bowl each took home $130,000. 
The bonus associated with playing in the Super Bowl grows each year, according to the agreement. Last year the winners’ bonus was $157,000. Next year, it’s set to rise to $171,000. By the 2030-31 football season (the last seasons covered in the most recent bargaining agreement), the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000. 
When it comes to pay for the Super Bowl, it doesn't matter whether the Kansas City Chiefs or San Francisco 49ers are the winners, their players will still get paid tens of thousands of dollars. 
The payouts are written into the NFL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement and change over time. Below, we outline the payment structure and how much players get for winning the Super Bowl: How much do the winners of the Super Bowl get paid? For the 2023 Super Bowl (2022-23 season), winners of the NFL’s finale will receive a $157,000 bonus. 
Then there are the Super Bowl rings. The NFL shells out between $5,000 to $7,000 for up to 150 rings per team, with additional costs falling to the team owners. Each ring is custom-designed by the

In addition to a ring and a permanent place in history, players on the winning and losing Super Bowl teams also receive a sizable bonus check. This money comes from an NFL postseason pool, not individual teams, according to "Money" magazine. 
The Super Bowl MVP winner gets the Pete Rozelle Trophy. Now, that might not be as exciting as the Lombardi Trophy, but it’s still a huge honor for most NFL players. The list of Super Bowl MVPs

Throughout the year, NFL teams go through several end-of-rotation players. Those who win the Super Bowl rarely reward the guys who never made it to the big run. According to The Athletic, there are no regulations regarding who does and does not receive a Super Bowl ring, but the winning team is limited to 150 orders for a ring. These are doled

We consulted four astrologers and four tarot readers to get their predictions about who would win the Super Bowl in 2025. The predictions are mixed – but one team is a clear winner. 
The trophy was re-designed for the 2010-11 playoffs. It now more closely resembles a smaller version of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The trophy itself can be bittersweet for a team that fails to go on and win the Super Bowl. In that case, the trophy is simply a reminder that the team did not manage to win it all. </p>
