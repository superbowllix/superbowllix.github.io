        <h2><strong>super bowl history over under super bowl halftime usher ludacris</strong></h2>
        <p>The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
Taking out two pushes and one pick ’em game, favorites are 28-27 (51%) in the game against the spread. The over/under is split exactly down the middle with 29 games going over the total and 29 staying under (Super Bowl I had no over/under odds posted, but one would have to assume it would have gone over with 45 points scored). 
For OVER/UNDER bets, a total point threshold is set, such as the 49.5 total point mark for Super Bowl LIX. Bettors predict whether the combined score of both teams will be OVER or UNDER this number. The UNDER has hit in five of the last six Super Bowls. 
In the 2019 Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. The three points by the Rams matched an all-time low in the big game, matching the Miami Dolphins from way back in Super Bowl VI. 
Favorites are 28-28-2 in the 58 Super Bowls that have been contested. The UNDER is 29-28 in Super Bowl betting history. There was no total posted for Super Bowl 1. This year's Big Game will be a  
Highest Total (Over/Under): The highest total (over/under) in the Super Bowl was 58.5 points in Super Bowl 58.5, when the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34-28 in overtime. Lowest Total (Over/Under): 33 is the lowest total posted for the Super Bowl and it has happened four times: XXXV: Giants vs Ravens 
There have been 57 Super Bowls in NFL history and the favorite is 35-21 straight up with one pick ’em game (Super Bowl XLI between the 49ers and Bengals). The favorite is 25-28-3 ATS, with the straight-up winner as the ATS winner in Super Bowl XLI. With 56 lined totals in the Super Bowl, the Over is 28-27-1, with the push coming in Super Bowl  
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
History Of Super Bowl Betting Odds The First AFL-NFL World Championship Game was in 1966, and while sports betting was not as sociable acceptable at the time, odds were available for the big game. Over the past 50 years, Super Bowl betting has become increasingly popular and is now one of the most wagered on events in the world. 
In terms of the over/under, the results are split almost exactly down the middle. Of the 56 Super Bowls with over/under data, 28 games have gone over the total, while 28 have stayed under. It is worth mentioning that the first Super Bowl had no over/under odds posted, but with 45 points scored, one would assume it would have gone over. 
Recent Super Bowl Over/Under History. The Under has been the play lately, hitting in five of the last six Super Bowls. The Under barely hit last year, however, and the 2023 game between the Chiefs  
The OVER is 10-6-1 on the National Anthem dating back to Super Bowl 41. Super Bowl National Anthem Prediction. We have a somewhat recent example of Jon Batiste performing the National Anthem at a  
This is a rematch of Super Bowl LVII when the Chiefs posted a 38-35 win over the Eagles in Glendale, Ariz., Feb. 12, 2023. Kansas City is 4-2 all time in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs lost Super Bowl I to the Green Bay Packers 35-10 in Los Angeles Memorial Stadium Jan. 15, 1967. 
A: Many sports websites and online sportsbooks will post the current Super Bowl over/under line. Q: How do I place an over/under bet? A: You can place an over/under bet at a sportsbook, either online or at a physical location, depending on the laws in your area. Conclusion. The Super Bowl over/under is a fascinating and popular bet. 
History of the Super Bowl National Anthem Over/Under Prop For 18 years, the Super Bowl national anthem has been more than just an opening note—it has been a possible wager, a guess, a heartbeat of anticipation before the first whistle is blown before the opening kickoff. 
The OVER and UNDER are deadlocked at 28-28 in Super Bowl betting history after the Chiefs and Eagles lit up the scoreboard last year. It marked the end of a four-year streak to the UNDER in the  
If you’re looking to cash a bet before Super Bowl 59 even begins, then betting on the National Anthem length may be the one for you. Betting on whether the National Anthem will go over a set number of seconds has grown in popularity in recent years, and this year won’t be any different. 
The national anthem has gone two or more minutes eight times in the previous 12 Super Bowls. We haven’t seen two Super Bowl anthems go under two minutes since 2011-12. This year, Jon Batiste, a singer and songwriter, will perform the national anthem before Super Bowl LIX. 
In last year's Super Bowl LVIII, Reba McEntire's rendition seemingly hit the Under on length. But an extra "brave" at the end technically sent the song Over. Ultimately, some sportsbooks ended up  
Take the under. Kyle Stackpole: Jalen Hurts over 200.5 passing yards (-114, BetRivers):  There has only been two overtimes games in Super Bowl history (Super Bowl LI, Super Bowl LVIII).  </p>
