        <p>Entering Super Bowl 59 this year, Philadelphia has been to four NFL title games and holds a 1-3 record in Super Bowl matchups. The Eagles lost in each of their first two Super Bowl appearances.

The Eagles Came Close in Super Bowl 39. The Eagles had lost three consecutive NFC Championship Games heading into the 2004 season, leaving a poor taste in the mouth of everyone in Philadelphia. After trading for wide receiver Terrell Owens over the offseason, the Eagles managed the NFC’s best regular-season record for the fourth year in a row. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
As of January 2025, the Philadelphia Eagles have appeared in 53 playoff games and have won 27 games, losing 26, per Pro Football Reference.  Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl appearances: How many
