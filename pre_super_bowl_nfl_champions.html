        <p>The NFL Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. [2] [6] The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion. [2] The Green Bay Packers won the most NFL championships before the merger, winning eleven of the fifty  
The Green Bay Packers have won the most NFL championship titles with 13 (nine pre-Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls, including the first two AFL-NFL World Championship Games). The Chicago Bears have won the second most overall championships with nine (eight pre-Super Bowl era and one Super Bowl) and the New York Giants have won the third most  
Cincinnati Bengals (3) – XVI, XXIII, and LVI; an AFL expansion team in 1968, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships. Carolina Panthers (2) – XXXVIII and 50; a post-merger expansion team, their first season was in 1995. Atlanta Falcons (2) – XXXIII and LI; an NFL expansion team in 1966, they have no pre-Super Bowl league  
Super Bowl winners and scores: NFL championship game results through the years. Jim Reineking.  Pre-Super Bowl era league champions. 1965: Green Bay Packers (NFL), Buffalo Bills (AFL) 
This is a list of National Football League (NFL) champions before the 1970 AFL–NFL merger. From 1920–1932, the league champion was determined by a team's win–loss percentage, with tied games omitted.[1] In 1932, because of a tie in the final standings, a playoff game was played to determine the championship.[2] In 1933, the NFL played its first official championship game.[2] On July 31  
The two conference champions meet in the Super Bowl to determine the champion. The Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots are tied for the most Super Bowl victories with six, while the Patriots lead the NFL with 11 total appearances. 
1960–1969—The Super Bowl Begins . The fledgling American Football League jockeyed with the NFL for players and fans from 1960 through 1969. The teams began playing a championship game, dubbed the "Super Bowl" in 1967. Vince Lombardi's mighty Green Bay Packers dominated the first two championship matchups, winning in 1967 and 1968. 
In 1967, when it was first held, the Super Bowl was known formally as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game. Its familiar grandiose name, followed by a Roman numeral, was added retroactively, though CBS did refer to the game as the Super Bowl in its promos. (That Roman numeral label will be discarded after this year’s contest.) 
However, the NFL Record &amp; Fact Book lumps all NFL Championship games in with the NFC Championship results. For a composite list of Super Bowls and pre-Super Bowl era championships, click here.

But the Eagles managed a single touchdown to come out on top, 7-0. It remains the lowest-scoring championship game, pre and post-Super Bowl era, in NFL history. 7. 1963: Chicago Bears 14, New York Giants 10. This particular edition of the championship, the third-last before the Super Bowl era, was played under the backdrop of tragedy. 
The next seven campaigns ended with the Packers claiming five titles. They walloped the Giants 37-0 in 1961, and then – with a team that is generally considered the best one in NFL history, pre-Super Bowl – beat them again in ’62. 
A look at the results for every Super Bowl, with the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers tied for the most all-time wins.  Pre-Super Bowl era league champions. 1965: Green Bay Packers  
The Super Bowl — the NFL's championship game — pits the winner of the American Football Conference against the winner of the  Pre-Super Bowl era league champions. 1965: Green Bay Packers  
All 100 NFL Championships (1920-2019).- Pre championship game era- Championship game era- Super Bowl era (1-54) 
Because, for the entirety of the 60s, there were 2 football leagues that have teams that currently exist. They both existed before the first Super Bowl. The first AFL-NFL Super Bowl was following the 1966 season. So for 1960-1965, there were AFL champions as well as NFL champions. Who claims the championship for those years? 
It seems like whenever titles are counted, NFL Championships are counted as a different sort of championship than a Super Bowl -- obviously this is due to the original format of the game followed by the merger, but as a big basketball fan, it's odd to me that nobody seems to regard pre-ABA/NBA merger NBA titles as unique in the same way. 
The first Super Bowl, played Jan. 15, 1967, in Los Angeles, pitted the NFL champion Packers against the Chiefs, then champs of the upstart AFL.. Up until then, the NFL — which came into being in  
Of course. The NFL predated the AFL by 40 years. There was no "Champions League" title or anything higher for the top NFL team to aspire to. Try telling a Packers fans that none of their titles count prior to Super Bowl I, and see how far that gets you. 
The only difference between an NFL Championship and a Super Bowl Championship is the name. When the AFL was created in 1960, it was pretty weak compared to the NFL. Obviously it improved throughout the decade, but the Packers had easy victories over the AFL in the first two Super Bowls. </p>
