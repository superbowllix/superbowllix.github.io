        <h2><strong>jlo super bowl reddit nfl super bowl 2025 playoff bracket</strong></h2>
        <p>Another ‚Äúinteresting thing‚Äù about that performance, JLo was so horrid to the dancers one very famous and super talented dancer quit dancing professionally in order to try and start an organization, a movement, whatever she could do to keep situations like what happened at that Super Bowl from ever happening to other dancers again. 
I felt the opposite. I actually didn‚Äôt notice Shakira was lip syncing, I just thought the backing track was very loud. J Lo however was VERY bad at it and super obvious. She completely missed words and moved the mic from her mouth at the wrong times. I think she even noticed herself when she messed up 
I'm still surprised that she didn't at least play Me Gusta, just because its not uncommon for the Super Bowl to let a performer have one new single on the setlist even if it isn't big yet, since the benefit of the super bowl is giving a song like that the biggest platform possible (see Million Reasons, Formation, hell even Filthy as tracks played there which hadn't taken off yet) 
Jennifer Lopez is facing backlash after revealing she was unhappy about sharing the stage with fellow artist Shakira at the 2020 Super Bowl. Emma Mcintyre / WireImage The duo took the stage by storm at the iconic annual halftime show, with their history-making performance attracting tons of praise from fans and celebrities worldwide.

I've noticed people love an opportunity to jump on JLO, but y'all should really read the article first. She is not dissing Shakira, and NFL initially was only going to give Shakira 3 minutes but Jennifer insisted they split the time in half. I know that the Super Bowl people want us to be weaved throughout the show.

For context, that article gives the peak viewership for the 2020 Super Bowl as 103.5 M, while Wikipedia says the average viewers in 2015 was 114.4 M. Since 2015, there's been a lot more negative publicity for the NFL, and a lot more people cutting cable. 
I‚Äôm shocked JLo didn‚Äôt have Shakira nix that outfit since she is supposed to be the ass-queen. Shakira has that jiggle and JLo was wrapped up in body shaping tights that didn‚Äôt allow anything to move. ü§î If you are going to do a booty shake shot don‚Äôt bind the booty in spanx. 
Some of the costumes in J-Lo's performance showed a tribute to Selena, one of the most celebrated Mexican-American entertainers of all time (who J-Lo played in the 1997 biographical film.) J-Lo, who is of Puerto Rican descent, donned a reversible cape showing the Puerto Rican and American Flags on either side. 
Not only is he Mr. 305, he was literally part of "On the Floor" with J Lo. For the sake of progressing the medley, it might have made sense, but I really feel like Pitbull should have been there for at least that part, considering how much he represented Miami as he blew up at the top of last decade. 
43 and 50 Year old Shakira and Jennifer Lopez performing at the Super Bowl today.  99% of people on reddit could find someone healthier than they are out there  
View community ranking In the Top 1% of largest communities on Reddit. Over 1,300 complaints were sent to the FCC about Shakira and J.Lo's Super Bowl halftime show. 
I don't think the Selena movie solely blew JLO up. Dating Puff Daddy is the reason she got a record deal. I think JLO would still be big in her own regards. She is an excellent dancer (Fly Girl) &amp; was already acting before the Selena movie. Selena and JLO both have different talents. JLO: hard-core dancer and entertainer.
