Most Super Bowls are played in warmer locations to avoid the possibility of winter weather causing chaos for travel. Before Super Bowl XVI in Michigan, all of the games had been held in the south or southwestern U.S. The next one played in the north was Super Bowl XXVI held in Minneapolis in 1992. 
In the Super Bowl era, the Lions have made three appearances in the NFC Championship Game: the 1991 season (lost to Washington) and the 2023 season (lost to San Fransisco). What Is the Lions’ Super Bowl Record? The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games.

However, this time will be different. The Lions will have learned from their previous loss and will be determined to claim their first Super Bowl title. 
The Detroit Lions' playoff run came to a heartbreaking end in the Divisional Round against the Washington Commanders. However, a recent admission by the NFL has reignited frustration for Lions fans, as it has been revealed that a missed penalty may have been a key turning point in the game that ultimately led to their loss. 
The Super Bowl Landscape: What Does It Take to Win? Success in the NFL comes from many things. These things make teams great. Looking at the Detroit Lions’ Super Bowl history is interesting.
