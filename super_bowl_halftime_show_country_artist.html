        <p>The '90s (and beyond) queen of country music, Shania Twain performed the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVII between the Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers alongside No Doubt and Sting. 
The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show starring Michael Jackson is the most watched Super Bowl halftime show, with a TV audience of more than 133.4 million viewers. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] The Super Bowl LVI halftime show starring Dr. Dre , Snoop Dog , Eminem , Mary J. Blige , Kendrick Lamar and 50 cent is the most viewed Super Bowl halftime show on YouTube  
Kid Rock, Shania Twain and Doug Kershaw have all been part of previous Super Bowl halftime performances -- but country music really got its (half)time to shine in 1994. 
It was 1994. Yup, that’s how far back we have to go to go country at the Super Bowl. On January 30, 1994, Super Bowl XXVIII was played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The game featured the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Buffalo Bills. The Cowboys took the win and their 4th Super Bowl, as a franchise. The Halftime show was pure country. 
Fast forward to Super Bowl 59, which will take place in New Orleans on Feb. 9, 2025. That will mark 30+ years since a country artist has been involved in the halftime performance, let alone  
The first celebrity performance at halftime of the Super Bowl show was in 1970 when the show included Marguerite Piazza, Doc Severinsen, Al Hirt, Lionel Hampton and the Southern University

Luke Bryan had the honor of singing the national anthem at the 2017 Super Bowl, but he is far from the first country artist to take part in the big event. In fact, several country acts have graced  
For those artists who do reach that halftime pinnacle, it can be glorious, says Tucker, who performed her sassy 1993 country smash, “It’s A Little Too Late,” and joined The Judds for a  
When Lamar was named the headline artist for the Super Bowl 59 halftime show, Henley told USA TODAY Sports he was genuinely happy that an LA hip-hop artist would take centerstage at arguably the  
Hip-hop royalty graced the stage at the 2022 halftime show at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles during Super Bowl LVI, led by none other than the esteemed Dr. Dre. Joined by fellow legends Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent, and Kendrick Lamar, this star-studded lineup performed an exhilarating medley of their greatest hits, including "California Love," "Still D.R.E.," “Alright” and  
The Halftime show in every Super Bowl is always special. Half time shows display a great production that has been planned months prior to the Super Bowl featuring known artists. Super Bowl XXVII featured some of the biggest country music stars at that time. 
Super Bowl XXXVII was the last time a country artist was invited to perform at the halftime show. And yeah, that was 2003! And yeah, that was 2003! The halftime show at the Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California starred Shania Twain, Gwen Stefani’s No Doubt, and Sting. 
Members of the Nashville music industry are weighing on why fans haven't seen a country star perform on the Super Bowl halftime show in nearly 20 years. 
The performance will mark a significant milestone as Lamar becomes the first solo hip-hop artist to headline the halftime show. When questioned about his approach to recent musical confrontations, Lamar maintained a sporting perspective: “My intent, I think from day one, was to always keep the nature of it as a sport.”

The Super Bowl halftime show hasn't seen a country artist perform since Shania Twain in 2003. I don't know why it is that one of America's most popular genres of music continues to be snubbed for the honor of performing during football's biggest night. </p>
