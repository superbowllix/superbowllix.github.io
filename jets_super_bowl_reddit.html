        <p>9 of the last 10 Super Bowl champions were listed at +1200 or shorter to win the Super Bowl. The teams expected to win, usually do. In that case, the Jets at +1600 would have to buck the trend. If the offensive line is better than we think they could do just that. 
The Super Bowl used to have very generic logos with just whatever number it was and the trophy. They’ve recently changed it to be more colorful, since the nfl have changed the logo of the Super Bowl, the last 3 Super Bowls logos have had the colors of the teams that have played in the Super Bowl. 
The place to discuss all NFL related things Members Online [Terrin Waack] The Caesars Superdome is available to host the Week 4 game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday if needed due to Hurricane Ian. 
New Jets head coach Aaron Glenn takes a timeout to kick off his Gang Green tenure to talk about the Jets’ future and his past with the team in a Q&amp;A with Post columnist Steve Serby. 
But from where we stand now, at the start of the 2024-25 NFL season, FOX Sports' staff of football and gambling experts delivered their predictions on who will be left holding a trophy at the  
The Jets' best chance to reach the Super Bowl after the Super Bowl III victory was thwarted by A.J.

Super Bowl MVP predictions in Super Bowl LIX. I don't think there's any question about the order in which you would assume Super Bowl MVP for this game is going to be decided: Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs; Saquon Barkley, RB, Eagles; Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles; It would take a herculean effort by anybody else in this game to be awarded Super Bowl MVP. 
Finally! After weeks of waiting, the NY Jets have officially acquired Aaron Rodgers via trade from the Green Bay Packers. The Jets swapped first-round picks with the Packers, traded the No. 42 and  
The NY Jets were widely seen not only as a potential playoff team in a loaded AFC but as true Super Bowl contenders entering the 2024 season. Much of that offseason hype could be attributed to the

Confidence: Low - In three previous Super Bowl appearances, Mahomes has a 61.8% completion with five TDs and four INTs. He was clutch in the Super Bowl victories against the Niners and Eagles. Kelce has 23 receptions on 27 targets with 257 yards and three TDs in the playoffs, and that is going to be the key matchup against Warner and Greenlaw. 
My heart wants Cincy to win but I think the Rams experience in the Super Bowl will give them the slight edge. I have this game playing out like Pittsburgh/Arizona SB43 did. A couple of exciting late lead changes, but ultimately the Rams come out on top. SUPER BOWL 56

Super Bowl III is really when things changed. The 66 and 67 Packers cared more about repeating as NFL champions. Winning the "AFL-NFL Championship Game" was anticlimactic for them. But the Colts were so traumatized by losing Super Bowl III they never got over it, even when they won Super Bowl V two years later. 
Kansas City and Philadelphia face off on Feb. 9 in New Orleans' Caesars Superdome. If you can't attend the Big Game in person, here's how to watch the show on TV or stream it online.

#1- Super Bowl 51 Patriots-34 Falcons-28. I think this is the consensus opinion on the best Super Bowl out of this group and it has a good case for greatest Super Bowl ever but I think Ravens-49ers or Steelers-Cardinals are pretty hard to top. 
TSN will carry the Super Bowl ($20 monthly). TSN Plus ($8 monthly, included with TSN) will show a "data-enhanced" stream of the Super Bowl. DAZN will carry the Super Bowl as part of NFL Game Pass International ($30 monthly). This is probably true in many other countries where NFL GPI is available on DAZN. </p>
