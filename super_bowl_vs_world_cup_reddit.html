        <h2><strong>super bowl vs world cup reddit super bowl start time on paramount plus</strong></h2>
        <p>Not sure they're really comparable. The World Cup is the biggest international tournament for the world's most popular sport. The super bowl is a massive cultural event in one country, for a sport nobody else much plays. Though 'better' is entirely subjective. If you prefer American football, then you're going to find the super bowl better. 
If the US won the World Cup, it would be the biggest news and greatest catastrophe outside the US for months or years, and might be a one-day story within the US--literally, Europe, South America, Africa, Asia would care more about the US winning the World Cup than the US would about winning the World Cup. When an NFL team wins the Super Bowl  
Last year the AVERAGE price for a Super Bowl ticket was $8600. That was more than the price for the most expensive ticket at the MLS Cup. The most expensive ticket at the Super Bowl was $70,000. MLS Cup may have had 3,000 more people in the seats. I would estimate the Super Bowl gate receipts were more than 8 times higher. 2. 
Super Bowl vs World Cup. As you can see, the numbers don’t lie when comparing the Super Bowl with the World Cup. If you want to compare football and soccer domestically, we have an NFL vs MLS article that may interest you. Also, here is one more look at the facts and figures comparing the Super Bowl with the World Cup. 
World Cup. A worldwide sporting event that is played only every 4 years; Brings together different cultures from all over the world; For many fans, has a deeper significance that transcends mere sport; Isn't as big a TV advertising event as the Super Bowl; Super Bowl. A championship finals series; Comprised only of American football teams from  
The Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup wield considerable cultural and social influence, though in different contexts. In the U.S., the Super Bowl has become a cultural phenomenon. Super Bowl Sunday is an unofficial national holiday, with parties, family gatherings, and special events taking place across the country. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
The disciplines also have two of the most popular competitions. Dig in for a complete Super Bowl vs World Cup Finals comparison, focusing on fan participation, viewership, and revenue generated.

The place for news articles about current events in the United States and the rest of the world. Discuss it all here. 
The massive viewership numbers of the World Cup and Super Bowl pad the coffers of FIFA and the NFL respectively. FIFA has turned a profit of nearly $5 billion or more from the last three World Cups. 
As the world cup is broadcasted in hundreds of countries, it's probably tricky to get an exact number, that's why we're just talking estimates, but I think the point stands, there are a lot more people viewing the World Cup than the Super Bowl (which is probably only a mild surprise as the Super Bowl is mostly a national event, while the World

The World Cup has competitors from almost every nation on earth, that's why it's every 4 years due to the length of qualifying to actually be one of the 36 teams competing in the final stages. To get to the superbowl you just have to buy a franchise, move it to a new city then compete for 5 months and a bit against some of the 32 teams to win  
Super Bowl for me just for the fact it’s single elimination. One bad half (or quarter) and you’re done. A team can go 16-12 and still win the championship, the superbowl champ HAS to go undefeated in the playoffs. 
As someone who enjoys both footballs, the World Cup is definitely bigger. American football is only eleven minutes in 3 hours because it’s sort of like a game of chess. You have to predict what move your opponent is gonna make and try to call the correct counter to it. 
more than 219.4 million americans tuned in for the Olympics. I would imagine if the US had a chance at winning the world cup and becoming the best team in the world similar numbers would be met. We like being the best in the world, your telling me people wouldn't watch or at least tune in to see if we pull it off? 
No. It’s not - statistically it’s so much easier to be a professional hockey player from some podunk town in Saskatchewan in the Stanley Cup than to win a World Series or Super Bowl. So - statistically - the Stanley Cup is the easiest trophy to win - by far. The toughest - the World Cup in Soccer. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event of the year by a wide margin. People who haven’t watched a single NFL game all year will plan Super Bowl parties. That’s not to say that people consciously think ‘winning the Super Bowl is more impressive than winning the NBA Finals’. But way more people care about the former than the latter. 
It is a serious question. Im sorry if it seems like a joke or rude. The highest level or competition in my country is the world football (soccer) cup, because we test our team against the whole world. 
ELI5: Why, exactly, has the Super Bowl become a much, much bigger cultural celebration in the USA than the World Series, NBA Finals, and Stanley Cup finals? Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. </p>
