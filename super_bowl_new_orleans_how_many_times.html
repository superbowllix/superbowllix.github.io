The city of New Orleans has hosted the Super Bowl 11 times, the most of any city and second-most of any metropolitan area (Miami). Caesars Superdome — previously the Louisiana Superdome and Mercedes-Benz Superdome — has hosted the game seven times, the most of any stadium. Tulane Stadium — demolished in 1980 — hosted three times. 
The Caesars Superdome opened in August 3, 1975 and since then this high-class NFL stadium has been one of the premier football venues and playing host to many great Super Bowl moments over the years. In fact, no other US NFL stadium can claim to have staged more Super Bowls – as we’ve now seen a Caesars Superdome Super Bowl seven times in  
Super Bowl XLVII has already taken over New Orleans, even though the game itself won't kickoff until Sunday, Feb. 2. But New Orleans is no stranger to Super Bowls, having hosted nine previous ones.

History It's What We Do New Orleans has made the big game “super” in every decade dating back to 1970. Four times in the 70s, three times in the 80s, twice in the 90s and once in the 00s and 10s. We’ve seen Staubach, Bradshaw, Favre and Brady hoist the Vince Lombardi trophy, the Fridge 
Super Bowl XXIV: January 28, 1990. The next time New Orleans hosted the Super Bowl was an even bigger blow out. In fact, it was the largest margin of victory in the game’s history with Joe Montana’s San Francisco 49ers defeating John Elway’s Denver Broncos 55-10. Montana completed 76% of his passes on his way to his fourth Super Bowl win. 
How many times has New Orleans hosted the Super Bowl? New Orleans will host its 11th Super Bowl this year, tying Miami for the most ever. Los Angeles is in third with eight games.
