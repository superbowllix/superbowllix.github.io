The Detroit Lions are riding high, elevated to a status they've never had as Super Bowl favorites. The Lions (15-2) are favored to beat Washington (13-5) by more than a touchdown, according to

For as much success as the Lions have had since the second half of the 2022 season, the organization has yet to still do one thing: make a Super Bowl. If Detroit were to do so this season, it  
The Lions led that game 24-7 at the half, but they let it slip away, and Campbell knew exactly how tough it would be to return to a position to even get into a Super Bowl, much less win it. As it  
In a fitting tribute to the Lions' incredible season, the Spirit of Detroit statue now sports a fresh look in honor of the team’s Super Bowl aspirations.

Free Press sports writer Dave Birkett highlights the best and worst performances of the Detroit Lions’ 48-42 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday at Ford Field.. The Lions (12-2) lost for the first time in exactly three months — when they also lost at home to Tampa Bay, 20-16, in Week 2 on Sept. 15 — and had their franchise-record 11-game win streak snapped. 
A Super Bowl Run Within Reach. Having Aidan Hutchinson and Derrick Barnes available would give the Lions a much-needed defensive boost as they look to compete for a championship.
