        <h2><strong>how much did the cerave super bowl commercial cost super bowl bets for kids</strong></h2>
        <p>From humble beginnings in 1967, when a 30-second ad cost just $37,500, to the jaw-dropping $7 million price tag in 2023, the cost of Super Bowl advertising has skyrocketed. Hype, history, trends, and key milestones have all defined the evolution of Super Bowl ad prices. We are proud to have been a part of it for so long. 
As expected, the prices for a 30-second spot have skyrocketed since the first big game kicked off back in the 1960s, with a commercial in Super Bowl I running just over $37,000. 
These events led to the epic conclusion of the Michael CeraVe marketing campaign – a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl (and an extended version as well). The ad featuring Cera was satirical, over-the-top and dramatic, ending with the reveal that Micheal Cera is pitching his ad idea to a team of dermatologists. 
The cost for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial has hit new heights, with ads being sold for about $8 million in the weeks leading up to the game, according to multiple reports. While Fox sold out its Super Bowl commercial inventory months in advance, broadcasters hold additional ad spots for unexpected delays in the game. 
As per the report, brands were willing to invest upwards of $8 million to run ads during Fox’s 2025 Super Bowl broadcast. That being said, here is the cost of 30-second Super Bowl ads since 1967: 
How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years? The cost of a Super Bowl ad has jumped in recent years, rising from $4.5 million in 2019 to $7 million today. 
How much is a Super Bowl commercial in 2025?  Here's what 30-second Super Bowl ads have cost through the years: Super Bowl 1, 1967 – $37,500; Super Bowl 2, 1968 – $54,500; 
This all built up to a 30-second ad spot for CeraVe in last Sunday’s Super Bowl. The ad reportedly cost the brand $7 million. Research dive: Glossy+ Research analyzed available Google Trends data for the week surrounding the Super Bowl to see the impact this ad had on search interest. 
Bottom line: At the cost of $5.6 million, the 2020 Super Bowl commercials are still the most expensive to date, beating out 2021’s commercial costs by $100,000. The most memorable commercial of Super Bowl LIV was Google’s “Loretta,” which tells the story of an elderly man using Google Assistant to remember his late wife. 
A 30-second commercial during Super Bowl 58 costs $7 million. Super Bowl commercial cost by year. Here's what 30-second Super Bowl ads have cost through the years: Super Bowl I, 1967 – $37,500  
So for Super Bowl 58, skincare brand CeraVe found its perfect partner: the aptly-named actor, Michael Cera. Known for his stilted comedy style from roles in ‘Superbad’, ‘Scott Pilgrim vs. the World’ and ‘Barbie’, the Canadian star’s chemistry with the brand goes beyond their nominative similarity. 
The brand shipped those Cera-themed boxes of product to more than 400 influencers, some as part of a brand deal but most without any context that the package was part of CeraVe’s Super Bowl  
Online, people deemed the ad the "best Super Bowl commercial in years." Fans deemed the partnership between Cera(ve) the cream and Cera the actor " the smartest one in a while." Others went as far  
That's a CPM of $1.77 compared to Super Bowl's average CPM of $56.91.

What is the Cost of a 30-Second Super Bowl Commercial in 2025? Super Bowl LIX is on Feb. 9, 2025. Just one week after Halloween, FOX had sold all the ad slots for the game. Three months ahead of time. 
Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched telecast in U.S. history, delivering a nail-biting contest, a taut halftime show, a pop star romance and another year of celebrity-fueled, play-it-safe ads to more than 123 million viewers. 
While the cost of a 2024 Super Bowl ad matches 2023's average pricing, the cost has been steadily increasing over the years, rising from 2019's average price of $4.5 million. 
According to Ad Age, the average cost of a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl skyrocketed to $7 million in 2024, up from $5.6 million in 2020. But regardless of budget constraints, there's a lot
