        <h2><strong>worst super bowl teams ever super bowl bets results</strong></h2>
        <p>These are the worst NFL teams to ever play in a Super Bowl in the big game's history. 
Featuring double-digit turnovers, double-digit blowouts, and record-breaking futility, these are the 10 worst Super Bowls ever. Super Bowl VIII took place on January 13, 1974, and featured the Miami Dolphins taking on the Minnesota Vikings. 
Reaching the Super Bowl is the ultimate goal for every NFL team, but some squads simply didn’t belong on the game’s biggest stage. These teams defied expectations to make it to the  
Here is Athlon Sports’ list of the worst teams to ever play in a Super Bowl in the game’s 48-year history. It probably goes without saying that each of these teams ended up on the short 
Let's indeed rank the 10 worst Super Bowls in NFL history. 10. Super Bowl XLVIII. The Denver Broncos entered the Super Bowl XLVIII as a great offensive team that scored a 
With fingers crossed that this list won’t require an edit Monday morning, here are the 10 worst Super Bowls of all-time. 10. Super Bowl 50-Denver Broncos 24, Carolina Panthers 10. 
What were the worst Super Bowls of all time? These are the biggest Super Bowl blowouts, most boring Super Bowl matchups, and even a few were among the highest-scoring Super Bowl ever, but just weren't any fun to watch. Cast your votes below to rank the absolute worst, definitely NOT super, Super Bowls in football history. 
That’s not at all what this was, as the game was borderline unwatchable by halftime. The 45-point disparity between the teams is still the largest in Super Bowl history 34 years later. #4: Super Bowl XLVIII (Seattle Seahawks 43, Denver Broncos 8) The Broncos set an all-time NFL record by scoring 606 points (37.9 per game) en route to the  
To whet your appetite for either outcome, here’s TIME’s totally infallible list of the best and worst Super Bowls ever. We’ll start with the downers, so that the piece ends on a high note. 
Super Bowl V between the Baltimore Colts and Dallas Cowboys is often considered the worst Super Bowl ever played simply because of the terrible play from both teams. The 
9. Super Bowl XXXVI: New England Patriots 20, St. Louis Rams 17. 8. Super Bowl XXIII: San Francisco 49ers 20, Cincinnati Bengals 16. 7. Super Bowl LVII: Kansas City Chiefs 38, Philadelphia Eagles  
The 1980 Super Bowl featured the first Hispanic head coach, Tom Flores, to win a Super Bowl, leading the first Wild Card team to win the Super Bowl in the 1980 Oakland Raiders. Those milestones aside, this game wasn’t particularly significant from a legacy perspective, though it did help Cliff Branch further his postseason performance legend  
After that losing streak, nobody would have envisioned them going on to win the Super Bowl. However, sometimes you just have to get hot at the right time, which is why the 2011 Giants made a great postseason run, won a compelling Super Bowl but are still one of the worst Super Bowl-winning teams ever. 1. 1970 Colts 
Patriots were a somewhat weak team because of their defense (30th ranked by DVOA) which at the time was the worst defense to ever make the Super Bowl before they were “beaten” by the 2017 Pats. However, the 2011 Pats were still 4th overall in team DVOA solely on the strength of their offense. 
In Super Bowl XLVI, the Giants pulled off a 21-17 win against a Patriots team that had the worst defense to ever play in a Super Bowl. Only the 1970 Baltimore Colts were worse. 53. 2007 New York  
The then-losingest team in history to make a Super Bowl, with no notable players beyond JPP and Manning, beat the “unstoppable” Patriots in the most-watched event in tv history at the time. It’s like training your whole life to run a race just to get beaten by the guy who discovered shoes yesterday. 
Those factors make us agree that the Super Bowl XXV-winning Giants are one of the worst championship teams ever. 6. Super Bowl XLVII (2013): Baltimore Ravens Matthew Emmons-Imagn Images. 
Here are the ten worst teams to have ever won the big game. 10. Super Bowl XXX Dallas Cowboys  The Colts won the game on a 32-yard field goal in the first Super Bowl ever played on artificial turf. 
In Super Bowl XLVI, the Giants pulled off a 21-17 win against a Patriots team that had the worst defense to ever play in a Super Bowl. Only the 1970 Baltimore Colts were worse. 53. 2007 New York  
The two teams combined for a Super Bowl record 11 turnovers, with five solely in the fourth quarter. The Colts made seven turnovers, the most ever by a Super Bowl champion, and the Cowboys set a Super Bowl record with 10 penalties, costing them 133 yards. </p>
