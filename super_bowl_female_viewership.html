        <h2><strong>super bowl female viewership super bowl kickoff eastern time 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M).

There was not a blank space when it came to Super Bowl viewership. As was announced on Monday, Super Bowl 2024 averaged 123.4 million viewers on CBS platforms, a record not just for the Super Bowl  
49% of last year’s Super Bowl audience was female, marking the highest percentage of female viewership in history. 58.8 million women watched Super Bowl LVIII , a 9% increase from the previous year. 
In particular, women aged 18–24 exhibited a 24% surge in year-over-year Super Bowl viewership. Meanwhile, girls aged 12–17 showed an 11% uptick in viewership. Overall, women accounted for 58.8 million viewers, constituting 47.5% of the total audience – a record-breaking figure for the Super Bowl. 
Taylor Swift's influence on the Super Bowl elevated the television ratings for women as well, with five million more female viewers tuning in for the championship game than last year's Super Bowl  
Just as women’s sports are among the fastest-growing parts of the entire sports industry, women were a dominant story in final Super Bowl LVIII viewership figures.. Data from measurement agency Nielsen showed the final audience for Super Bowl LVIII reached an average of 123.7 million, up slightly from fast national estimates of 123.4 million and reconfirming the game’s status as the  
All told, girls and women accounted for a record 47.5% of the Super Bowl audience, as 5 million more females watched this year’s game than was the case a year ago. The gap between men and women narrowed to just 6.14 million viewers, which was down from the 7.53 million-person deficit recorded during Super Bowl LVII. 
As per the report, the biggest jump was in female and young viewership. Among the ages 18-24, women's viewership inreased 24 percent to 3.18 million and men increased 20 percent to 4.61 million  
Super Bowl LVIII, between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, was the most-watched Super Bowl of all time, drawing in an average audience of 123.4 million viewers, CBS Sports

The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
The regression model alone predicts Super Bowl viewership to be at 117.3 million for this year. However, when accounting for the Chiefs and Eagles viewership adjustment factors, that number jumps  
According to a survey from early 2025, men were more likely to watch the Super Bowl than women, with 72 percent of male respondents at least somewhat likely planning to watch the highlight of the  
Women have always watched the Super Bowl, with Nielsen reporting that in 2018, women made up nearly half of Super Bowl viewers—surpassing the combined female viewership of the Oscars, Grammys

• In women ages 18 to 24, this year’s Super Bowl viewership was up 24% from last year. • In girls ages 12 to 17, this year’s Super Bowl viewership was up 11% from last year.
