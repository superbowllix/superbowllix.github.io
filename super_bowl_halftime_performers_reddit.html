        <h2><strong>super bowl halftime performers reddit super bowl winner 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>I was working at a restaurant during the Super Bowl that year and I remember the game was on in the managers office so people could just filter in and out and kind of keep tabs on what was going on. But when that halftime show started I think every employee in that building was jammed into that office just watching it unfold in awe. 
He's the only halftime performer I've ever seen form enough of a connection to the audience in ten minutes to trust them to sing along, alone. If that hadn't worked after he kicked the mic over, it's totally dead. 
Anyone who says this isn't the greatest halftime show of all time has no idea what they are talking about And it was an actual live performance, not pre-recorded Also Prince covering Foo Fighters 
The first celebrity performance at halftime of the Super Bowl show was in 1970 when the show included Marguerite Piazza, Doc Severinsen, Al Hirt, Lionel Hampton and the Southern University  
Here is the complete list of previous Super Bowl halftime performers and themes: 2025: Kendrick Lamar with special guest SZA 2024: Usher with special guests Alicia Keys, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R  
The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show starring Michael Jackson is the most watched Super Bowl halftime show, with a TV audience of more than 133.4 million viewers. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] The Super Bowl LVI halftime show starring Dr. Dre , Snoop Dog , Eminem , Mary J. Blige , Kendrick Lamar and 50 cent is the most viewed Super Bowl halftime show on YouTube  
This is what it means today to headline a Super Bowl halftime show like Lamar, 37, will at Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans on Sunday, Feb. 9. Just three years ago, he played a secondary role at the  
This year, Kendrick Lamar will headline the halftime show and will be joined by SZA in a highly anticipated performance at Super Bowl LIX (Feb. 9 at 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX). This will actually mark  
Past Super Bowl performers have included pop acts, R&amp;B stars, rappers, rockers and even the occasional country singer, though that’s rare. The best shows combine showmanship with popular music. 
Other performers deserve to be in the conversation for the best Super Bowl halftime show ever, but man, good luck arguing against Prince. Beyonce (2013) Visuals galore! 
In a few years, I can see Doja Cat crushing the Super Bowl. She's already a good live performer, just needs more time to build her catalog. I know they offered Adele the position a few years ago and that would be a fascinating show to see at the Super Bowl. 
The Super Bowl Halftime Show is the most watched musical event (at least in America) each year. Over 100 million people watch it live just in the US (about 1/3 of the population), plus however many millions of people watch it later and/or outside of the US. 
It's about putting the idea fresh into your head. As a musician and really any brand, you want to constantly be reminding people of you and your music. Cause even a few thousand extra ticket sales from being the halftime performer of the super bowl is exposure beyond what you can get in most other ways. 
TN: How valuable is a Super Bowl halftime performance for older artists, like Usher, Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre? SL: When you think about why those artists do the Super Bowl, like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Mary J. Blige in 2022, they didn’t necessarily have a huge hit at the time. But they are hip-hop pioneers, and they go out there [on stage  
The Super Bowl has an extended halftime of 25-30 minutes due to the halftime show. The halftime show runs 12–15 minutes and will air on Fox. Super Bowl 2025 Halftime Show Guest Performers

2.2K votes, 8.6K comments. true. I thought it was good, I’m a metalhead so I don’t really listen to any of the people who do the halftime shows, but I thought this was the best one in a few years. 
That and playing at the Superbowl Halftime show doesn't actually pay all that much. The NFL doesn't pay the performers much. That and I know some artists have pur some kf their own money into the show to make it how they want to make it since the NFL doesn't invest too much into it these days. 
Diana Ross was considered a safe choice for Super Bowl XXX, but only a diva of her magnitude could pull off such a shocking performance. It starts off with her descending from the sky on a sparking platform, slowing considerably through a medley of her biggest hits, like “Baby Love” and “Stop in the Name of Love” with tuxedo-clad dancers all around her. 
Yeah, this halftime really demonstrated to me that either of them could have easily carried the entire performance alone. Although I think it might have the opposite effect, they might decide to from now on really push two performers sharing halftime which idk how to feel about. </p>
