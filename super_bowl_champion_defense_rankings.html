        <h2><strong>super bowl champion defense rankings super bowl day for ring devices</strong></h2>
        <p>The other Super Bowl champions were also ranked high on defense (2004 Patriots #2, 2005 Steelers #3 and the 2001 Patriots #6). This era could be an era of defense, or it might just be that it’s heavily influenced by one team, the Patriots who won 50% of the Super Bowls during this time with a highly ranked defense. 
Their top-tier Super Bowl defense regressed to 11th in '06, and Big Ben finished with 18 touchdown passes and a league-high 23 interceptions. Pittsburgh started 2-6 and could not recover in an 8-8  
We now have 56 Super Bowl champions. Here is how the previous Super Bowl winners' follow-up teams stack up historically. 
Ranking Every Super Bowl Champion.  Scoring Defense Rank:  Pittsburgh won 21-10 and head coach Bill Cowher and running back Jerome Bettis were able to retire as Super Bowl champions. The  
Baltimore's defense capped off its historic season with a masterful performance in Super Bowl XXXV. Facing a Giants team that scored 41 points in the NFC Championship Game, the Ravens' defense

Below are the rankings (in terms of PFF grades) for the past 10 Super Bowl winners, starting with the Peyton Manning-led Colts in 2006. *Regular-season grade ranking shown for each team. After aggregating PFF’s data from the past decade of Super Bowl champions, there are a few things we can take away and apply to this upcoming season. 
All six of the last six Super Bowl champions had an offense ranked higher than defense, and that gap between rankings has increased in each of the last three years with the 2020 Buccaneers (offense +5 over defense), 2021 Rams (+8) and culminating with the 2022 Chiefs who were ranked #1 on offense and # 16 on defense. 
The Kansas City Chiefs eked out a victory over the San Francisco 49ers, 25 to 22, in Super Bowl LVIII on February 11. Interpreted as: defensive ranking of last super bowl champs 
Some things to think about: The number 1 ranked defense has won the Superbowl %28.57 of the time while the number 1 offense has only won the Superbowl %20.41 of the time, and only twice (1972 Dolphins and the 1996 Packers) has a Superbowl winner been ranked first in both offense and defense. 
So I'm going by the rankings of points/ drive from Football Outsiders. Unfortunately this stat only goes back to 1993. Another thing that bears mentioning is that as always the stats don't tell the whole story. There are cases where a defense was badly ranked during the regular season and played great in the playoffs, same thing with offenses. 
Ranking every Super Bowl champion's title defense.  Their top-tier Super Bowl defense regressed to 11th in '06, and Big Ben finished with 18 touchdown passes and a league-high 23 interceptions

How to rank Super Bowl winners? Let us count the ways. There are so many measures by which we can look at past champions and rank their quality. Why not make it as objective as possible? 
The better defense in the Super Bowl usually wins  of the AFL and NFL champions. The leagues didn’t play each other during the regular season at that point, and the defensive rankings were  
10. Jordan Mailata, OT. Clearly, high-level football is played in the trenches, as Jordan Mailata is the fifth offensive lineman in our top 10 of the best players in Super Bowl 59. </p>
