Sometimes the Super Bowl’s standout performer offers a slight variation on the theme, saying they’re going to Walt Disney World. It comes across as an off-the-cuff moment in the celebratory hubbub after the NFL’s showpiece game has culminated, with confetti still falling and the hordes of players staff and media still flooding the field. 
Players named the MVP of the Super Bowl have for decades proclaimed that they're going to Disneyland or Disney World to celebrate their accomplishment as part of Disney's ad campaign. 
The winner of Super Bowl 58 will be headed toDisneyland! The post-Super Bowl celebration can be traced back to 1987 when Phil Simms uttered the famous line “I’m going to Disney World”. Simms and his family were then treated to a day at Magic Kingdom and a tradition was born. 
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. The most recent exception was in 2017, when Brady won his fourth of a record-setting five Super Bowl MVP trophies . 
Rutan responded, “We’re going to Disneyland.”  The phrase has been uttered by the game’s MVP or a significant contributor to the win every year since except for Super Bowl XXXIX. Disney  
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. The most recent exception was in 2017, when Brady won his fourth of a record-setting five Super Bowl MVP trophies . 
The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will face off in Las Vegas on Sunday, February 11. It’s a tradition for the Super Bowl winners to then visit Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The team’s MVP usually appears in a victory parade. Last year, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes visited. 
UPDATE 2/11/24: As the euphoria of Kansas City’s Super Bowl win continued to swirl around Allegiant Stadium near Las Vegas on Sunday night, Patrick Mahomes once again made that jubilant declaration that has become so iconic after every Super Bowl victory: “I’m Going to Disneyland!’’ This is the third time Mahomes has been named Super  
Super Bowl participants. Super Bowl XXI, 1987: Phil Simms, New York Giants Super Bowl XXII, 1988: Doug Williams, Washington Redskins Super Bowl XXIII, 1989: Joe Montana, San Francisco 49ers Super  
The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade on Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. With this year’s game being held in New Orleans, closer to the East Coast, it makes sense to celebrate the winner at Walt Disney World rather than Disneyland. Who do you think is going to win the Super Bowl LIX? 
Super Bowl Sunday is wrapping up, and fans watching have grown to anticipate this phrase at the end of the game: “I'm going to Disneyland!” or “I'm going to Disney World!” The Disneyland Super Bowl Parade featured a celebration of the winner of Super Bowl LVIII after the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs faced off. 
In 1987, Phil Simms, a former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, was featured in the first Disney post-Super Bowl ad exclaiming that he planned to go to Disneyland following his team  
Related: How to use points to buy Disney tickets If you're ever at Disney World or Disneyland the day after the Super Bowl (again, whichever park is closer to the location of the Super Bowl is typically utilized), there's a decent chance you'll see a representative or two from the winning Super Bowl team take their place in a celebratory parade down Main Street, U.S.A., which will be held  
After a win in last year's Super Bowl game, Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes declared that he was "going to Disneyland." Interestingly, about a decade before, Mahomes sent out a tweet  
Walt Disney World has announced that they will host the Super Bowl Super Bowl LIX this year with the event being held in New Orleans. The parade will be on Monday, February 10th and it traditionally features the MVP of the Super Bowl.

Later that month former New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms became the first MVP to say, "I'm going to Disney World!" Since then, every Super Bowl MVP has had the same post-season vacation plan. And yes, the MVPs who've said the line actually do go to Disney World or Disneyland, where they are treated to a celebratory parade. 
Super Bowl Sunday and the day after provide two very different Disneyland experiences. If you want to join in football celebrations, Super Bowl Sunday has festive energy and special merchandise. But the crowds are heavy all day. Returning the day after allows you to see the Super Bowl parade and players, but also draws peak Disneyland attendance. </p>
