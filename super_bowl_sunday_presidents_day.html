        <p>President Donald Trump is planning to attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans on Sunday, marking the first time a sitting president will appear at the game. The Super Bowl 59 matchup between the  
The biggest reason the Super Bowl is played on Sunday is simple: TV ratings. In a 2018 interview,  Some have suggested moving the Super Bowl to Presidents’ Day weekend, which would give many  
The 2025 Super Bowl, also known as Super Bowl LIX or Super Bowl 59, is set for 6:30 p.m. EST on Sunday, Feb. 9. The game will be played at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana . 
President Donald Trump will attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans on Sunday.  Donald Trump to attend Super Bowl for 1st time as president. Associated Press. Feb 4, 2025, 02:01 PM ET. 
The announcement comes the same day a White House official told NBC News that President Donald Trump would be attending the game.  Sunday's game will be the first Super Bowl since February 2021  
Presidents’ Day lands on the third Monday in February, and the Super Bowl will land on the second Sunday in February. Thus, the Super Bowl and Presidents’ Day will line up when Super Bowl lands on February 14, Valentine’s Day. Which is exactly what would have happened in 2021. That happens again in 2027, 2038, 2044, 2049, 2055. 
National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday he wants the league to move to fewer preseason games so the Super Bowl would fall on Presidents Day weekend, a three-day weekend. 
Thus, the Super Bowl and Presidents’ Day will line up when Super Bowl lands on February 14, Valentine’s Day. Which is exactly what would have happened in 2021. That happens again in 2027, 2038  
Presidents’ Day is the third Monday in February. The Super Bowl has been played on the second Sunday in February since the schedule expanded to 17 games in 2021. Goodell says the NFL would slash the preseason schedule to two games and tack on an 18th regular season game. 
However, major retail chains stay open, and many offer Presidents Day sales. Why is the Super Bowl on a Sunday? Ever since the championship game's inception on Jan. 15, 1967, the Super Bowl has  
"The other thing it does, [Super Bowl Sunday] ends on up Presidents' Day weekend, which is a three-day weekend, which makes it Sunday night and then you have Monday off." 
If there's one solution that might work for everyone without changing any laws, it could be moving the Super Bowl to the Sunday before Presidents Day, which is on the third Monday of February. 
As Presidents' Day is the third Monday of every February, and the NFL is likely moving the Super Bowl to the second Sunday in the month, on select years, the dates would line up perfectly. 
Commissioner Roger Goodell broke down why he wants the NFL schedule to feature 18 regular season games, two preseason games and the Super Bowl on Presidents Day weekend. 
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is mulling a future with 18 regular-season games, a Presidents Day weekend Super Bowl Sunday and a significant increase in international games. 
After years of hearing complaints from fans, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is considering moving the Super Bowl so it falls on the Sunday during the three-day Presidents Day holiday weekend. NBC  
'The other thing it does, (Super Bowl Sunday) ends on up Presidents' Day weekend, which is a three-day weekend, which makes it Sunday night and then you have Monday off.' 
Goodell noted that making the regular season a week longer would push the Super Bowl a week later, which most years would make it played on Presidents' Day weekend, giving many workers the day off  
National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday he wants the league to move to fewer preseason games so the Super Bowl would fall on Presidents Day weekend, a three-day weekend. 
The commissioner pointed out that moving to a two and 18 schedule would put Super Bowl Sunday on Presidents Day weekend. "That ends up on Presidents Day weekend, which is a three-day weekend  </p>
