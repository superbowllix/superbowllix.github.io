        <p>I think she's forgiving him for the way the fallout was handled. Janet was lambasted and shamed, while Justin walked away without scrutiny. He abandoned her to accept the blame. He's since apologized for his cowardice and how it affected Janet's career and emotional health. So yeah, I think she has stuff to forgive him for 
I heard this was basically a Leave Justin Alone piece and is it ever. “On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
An older lady had invited us over to have a super bowl party and watch the game on her big screen. When that happened the youth pastor just covered his face with his hands and ran out of the room lol 
On February 1, 2004, Janet Jackson, then 38-years-old, and Justin Timberlake, then 23-years-old, caused a wake of mass cultural hysteria when, at the end of Jackson’s Super Bowl Halftime  
Janet Jackson just reacted to criticism of Justin Timberlake years after her Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Halftime Show.  Submit to Reddit. Share on LinkedIn. 
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple  
It was Timberlake, after all, who along with Janet Jackson at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show gave birth to the phrase “wardrobe malfunction’’ and together were embroiled in “Nipplegate 
Janet Jackson was the halftime performer at the 2004 Super Bowl and delivered a precise, high-energy medley of hits from throughout her career, before ending in a duet with Justin Timberlake, then  
Timberlake returned to the Super Bowl halftime show in 2018 as a headliner, upsetting many including Jackson's father, Joe Jackson. "If he’s such a gentleman, he’d make sure Janet is there  
Even if they weren’t watching, everybody remembers the 2004 Super Bowl halftime controversy featuring Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson.The performance featured the infamous “wardrobe  
Lowe asked if Timberlake and Jackson “took some time to do that after the fact and kind of resolve the situation and were able to make peace of the whole thing.” Timberlake responded, "Absolutely," he said. "And I don't know that a lot of people know that. 
Another thing people forget is that Janet Jackson had been famous for at least eighteen years at at the time of the Super Bowl. She released Control in 1986 and the Super Bowl occurred in 2004. I remember her career being a little on the decline at this point. I never stopped letting Janet be a megastar. 
First, I love Janet Jackson, and I really enjoy Justin Timberlake. Both are people I’d love to meet, and both seem like genuinely nice people. On to my argument: Like many of you, I saw it live on tv. To this day, I cannot be convinced it was an accident. 
Well, I dispute that "Justin Timberlake caused" it. It was just so incredibly obvious they planned it. Justin, Janet, and several MTV execs and choreographers all decided they were going to do that, and they made up a ridiculous story when the reaction they got wasn't what they expected. 
Generation X was born, by broadest definition, between 1961 and 1981, the greatest anti-child cycle in modern history. Nevertheless, we grew up to become the world's most devoted parents: the "workhorse of America." 
This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). I remember people being quite negative about him being picked in 2017 because it was assumed he and Janet were banned after the controversial 2004 performance - CBS officials would deny placing a ban on her. 
This was the first half time show I missed. I was in the garage smoking a bowl. When I came back in, everyone was freaking out because of Janet Jackson's boob. I felt that I missed something culturally significant. I haven't missed a Super Bowl halftime show since. 
The Super Bowl was always weirdly conventional, but the commercials were all weirdly edgy. Two years earlier, there was that Coor’s Light Superbowl commercial that was a parody of Tom T Hall’s “I Love (Little Baby Ducks)” but the punchline is having threesome with twins (because lesbianism and incest are comparable, and both acceptable  
Generally I don't need to be convinced that people are willing to shit on women for anything sexual. But Janet Jackson was almost 40 at the time and her sales and popularity peaked in the early 90's. She didn't plateau after the Super Bowl issue. She continued slowly tailing off like she had been doing for the prior decade and like most pop  
Pharell says most of the songs on Justin Timberlake's "Justified" were meant for Michael Jackson, says Janet Jackson recorded an unreleased version of I'm A Slave 4 U by Brittney Spears. upvotes · comments </p>
