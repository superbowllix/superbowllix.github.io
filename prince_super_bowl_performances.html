The weather during the game had been rainy, and this inclement weather continued into Prince's performance, which took place during a downpour. [1] [2] Notably, it began raining during the performance of “Purple Rain.” This was the first occasion in which it rained during a Super Bowl halftime show. [2]

One of the most prestigious events in both the sporting and music-industry calendars, the Super Bowl halftime show was in a precarious position by the time Prince staged his iconic performance at Miami’s Dolphin Stadium, on 4 February 2007, during Super Bowl XLI. 
When Prince invited a group of Super Bowl executives to Los Angeles to discuss the possibility of a performance, the team around David Saltz, who worked with the NFL, was excited but somewhat wary.

Music Icon Prince performs at halftime of Super Bowl XLI, which the Colts won on February 4, 2007. 
It was a performance unlike any other Super Bowl halftime show, as he grabbed the attention of more than 93 million TV viewers, and captivated his audience for the entire 12-minute set. 
At the 2007 Super Bowl in Miami, Prince Rogers Nelson blew the crowd and the world away with a halftime performance that most consider the best in Super Bowl history. In the wake of Prince’s sudden passing April 21, 2016 at the age of 57, the NFL documentary short about his halftime performance, posted by the NFL YouTube channel two months

#1 Celya723 3 February, 2019, 01:13. You nailed it with Prince putting on the most dynamic Super Bowl performance in the pouring rain! I too have watched this game for many years and have cheered the transition of halftime performances from wholesome Americana to rock and pop performances from a great variety of proven and well regarded performers.

And at the Super Bowl – just as he had during his iconic solo during While My Guitar Gently Weeps at the 2004 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Dinner – Prince turned in a performance for the ages, all the while looking as relaxed as he might making breakfast at home in Paisley Park.
