        <p>How many Black quarterbacks have played in a Super Bowl? Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi  
In the National Football League’s (NFL) history, three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. In 1988, Doug Williams, who played for Washington, made history as the first Black QB to win the NFL’s biggest game. Decades later, Russell Wilson would lead the Seattle Seahawks to victory in 2014 and, most recently, Patrick Mahomes of Kansas City won 2019’s Super Bowl after a standout  
The upstart Eagles star was right: Only seven other Black quarterbacks have taken the Super Bowl stage as starters since the big game's inception at the end of the 1966 season. 
The first Black quarterback to start a Super Bowl was also the first to be taken in the first round of the NFL Draft.. Selected by Tampa Bay with the No. 17 overall pick in 1978, Doug Williams took the Buccaneers to the postseason three times in five years before a messy divorce led to his exit from the NFL. 
Over 100 quarterbacks have appeared at the Super Bowl, of which only eight were Black. Of the eight who have led their teams, only three have won. 
Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was the seventh black quarterback to start a Super Bowl. [30] The combined Super Bowl records of black quarterbacks is 5–7. Williams and Mahomes are to date the only players to win the Super Bowl MVP award. [31] 
The Super Bowl is the grandest stage in football, and throughout its history, only a handful of Black quarterbacks have started in the big game. From Doug Williams breaking barriers in the 1980s  
It would be another 26 years before another starting Black quarterback won a Super Bowl game. In the title game following the 2013 season, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson dominated Super Bowl 48 against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, leading his team to a 43-8 win to become the world champions. The 26-year-old QB completed  
It took 57 years to get to this point, but it’s finally here: This Sunday, Feb. 12, two Black starting quarterbacks will face off in the Super Bowl for the first time. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts punched his ticket to the big game with a 31-7 victory over the San Francisco 49ers on a Sunday afternoon in Philadelphia. 
The official name of this Super Bowl should be changed to the “Doug Williams Game.” Besides being the first Black quarterback to start a Super Bowl, Williams decided to make even more history  
Washington won 42-10, and Williams was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to start in and win any NFL championship game, including those before the Super Bowl was  
How many Black quarterbacks have played in a Super Bowl? Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi  
Mahomes is the youngest player ever to win an NFL MVP, a Super Bowl MVP, and a Super Bowl. He was 24 when he first achieved that. He is a Black quarterback. 
Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson throws a pass during the first half of Super Bowl XLIX against the New England Patriots on Feb. 1, 2015, in Glendale, Ariz. 
This Super Bowl Sunday, we are going to witness the absolute best that Black quarterbacking has to offer. The best part is that these two dudes, are the best in the NFL regardless of their race. 
How many Black quarterbacks have played in a Super Bowl? Just seven Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi  
Washington's Doug Williams opened the door – at least a crack – for other aspiring Black quarterbacks, leading Washington to a 32-point win over the Broncos in Super Bowl 22. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
On Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks walked all over the Denver Broncos, 43-8, to win Super Bowl XLVIII. Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson passed for 206 yards, ran for 26 more, threw two touchdowns  
Two Black quarterbacks in the Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and the Eagles' Jalen Hurts isn’t a story line for Super Bowl LIX, and that’s a beautiful act of resistance and acceptance. </p>
