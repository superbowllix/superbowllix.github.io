The Super Bowl is more than a game —it’s the apex of American sports and culture.  The most common matchup in Super Bowl history is Dallas vs. Pittsburgh, which has occurred three times  
Super Bowl History For Spread And Totals Betting. Historical data shows that Super Bowl winners almost always cover the spread. A comprehensive look at past winners reveals this trend to be a constant, as the eventual winner has covered the spread in nine of the last 10 games, and 17 of the past 20. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
The most common Super Bowl matchup has been the Steelers vs Cowboys, which has happened three times now. The first Super Bowl meeting between Pittsburgh and Dallas came in Super Bowl 10, which was played in 1976, and the most recent was Super Bowl 30, which was in 1996.
