        <h2><strong>super bowl kelce vs kelce super bowl parade live 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl 57 saw Travis and Jason Kelce face each other and led to some nicknaming the Super Bowl, the ‘Kelce Bowl.’ The game was the first Super Bowl where brothers were competing for a Super Bowl title on opposite sidelines, making Super Bowl history in the process. 
The next matchup was 2017, followed by 2021 and most notably, the 2023 Super Bowl, which some affectionately nicknamed the Kelce Bowl. Here, see whose team won each time the Kelces played against  
The Kelce brothers will be the first to play against one another in the Super Bowl, but siblings have reached the big game before. MORE: Jim Harbaugh must accept it's national title, not Super  
Some are labeling Super Bowl 57 the “Kelce Bowl.” Sunday’s Super Bowl pits Travis Kelce vs. Jason Kelce as the brothers vie for the right to take home the coveted Lombardi Trophy. Travis, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, goes up against Jason, the Philadelphia Eagles center, in one of the biggest subplots of the game. 
Donna Kelce talks about her sons playing against each other in the Super Bowl. Indeed, there have been plenty of famous NFL siblings over the years, and many had some memorable matchups: Peyton vs. Eli Manning, Tiki vs. Ronde Barber. 
No team has done it in the Super Bowl era, though the Green Bay Packers won an NFL championship in 1965 and followed by winning the first two Super Bowls. Kelce even started all the three-peat talk on stage last year when he said the team’s goal was to win three. “This is gonna be our biggest test yet,” Kelce said. 
The last time the Eagles were in the Super Bowl, Kelce was enjoying the best season of his NFL career. He earned a 94.8 PFF run-blocking grade and allowed 22 pressures across 19 games before becoming a Philadelphia legend in the celebration parade. 
The Kelce brothers battled head-to-head — or helmet-to-helmet — in Super Bowl 57 in February 2023, which resulted in a nail-biting 38-35 win for the Chiefs. 
Jason and Travis are no strangers to brotherly competition. They two faced-off against each other in 2023 during the Super Bowl, in what was dubbed the “Kelce Bowl.”. The Chiefs—who won in  
The Kelce vs. Kelce matchup will be the NFL's most prominent battle of brothers since John Harbaugh and Jim Harbaugh coached on opposite sidelines for the Ravens and 49ers in Super Bowl 47 back in

Kelce breaks his own Super Bowl record. Kelce already has his name etched in Super Bowl history. He owns the single-game Super Bowl receiving yards record for a tight end with 133, which he set in  
In fact, that’s never happened in the modern Super Bowl era, so the Chiefs are 60 minutes away from NFL immortality and you just know that in the biggest game of their lifetimes, Kelce is going

He had nine catches for 93 yards last year against the 49ers, six catches for 81 yards and a TD in Super Bowl 57, and ten catches for 133 yards in Super Bowl 55 against the Bucs. Kelce’s worst Super Bowl performance was his first back in 2020, when he had six catches for 43 yards and a touchdown in a 31-20 win over the 49ers. 
Ertz won a Super Bowl two years ago, Gronkowski won one last season and either Kittle or Kelce will get a run this year. Teams will always be on the lookout for their own elite tight end. </p>
