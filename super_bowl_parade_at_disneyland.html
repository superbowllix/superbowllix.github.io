        <h2><strong>super bowl parade at disneyland last super bowl the vikings played in</strong></h2>
        <p>Every year since, the Super Bowl parade has been at Disneyland. We went to yet another of these in 2022 after the hometown Los Angeles Rams celebrated their Super Bowl LVI victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. I couldnâ€™t pass up seeing former Detroit Lion Matthew Stafford, plus Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald of the Los Angeles Rams. 
The last few years of the Super Bowl parade have been at Disneyland in California. This year after the day of the game, the Super Bowl parade will take place at Disney World on Monday, February 10, 2025. Disney World has now confirmed through its Instagram story that the parade will occur on this day. There will typically be a short  
The Disneyland Super Bowl Parade will take place on Monday, February 12, celebrating the winner of Super Bowl LVIII.

The Super Bowl victory parade is included with regular park admission and starts at 2 p.m.; if youâ€™re looking for the best spots in Disneyland to view it, check out Travel and Leisureâ€™s advice  
Mahomes appeared in the victory parade with Disney characters in Disneyland Park. The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a parade at Walt Disney World was in 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade on Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. 
Disneyland usually hosts the parade when the Super Bowl site is located on the West Coast. This year itâ€™s in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Walt Disney World plays host to the cavalcade when the big game is on the East Coast or South. This will mark the third year in a row that the Super Bowl winners have gone to Disneyland. In 2023, the game was in  
The Super Bowl MVP is the third for Mahomes, who won the award last year in Super Bowl LVII and Super Bowl LIV in 2019. Each has ended with a national Disney commercial, a parade the day after the Super Bowl and a high-four with Mickey and the Disney gang at Disneyland or Walt Disney World. 
This is the third time Disneyland will host the Super Bowl in as many years. Disneyland to host Super Bowl parade.

Super Bowl Sunday and the day after provide two very different Disneyland experiences. If you want to join in football celebrations, Super Bowl Sunday has festive energy and special merchandise. But the crowds are heavy all day. Returning the day after allows you to see the Super Bowl parade and players, but also draws peak Disneyland attendance. 
At this time, Disney World has not announced what time the festivities will kick off. We do know, however, that the Super Bowl winners participate in a parade at Magic Kingdom.
