When high-profile referee Ed Hochuli visited the Seahawks' training camp in the months after that Super Bowl, he and his crew took good-natured ribbing from players.

Not every NFL referee is eligible to work the Super Bowl, as it is only open to officials who have refereed for at least five seasons and have previously officiated a playoff game. There are seven on-field officials and one replay official for every NFL game. Who are the officials at Super Bowl LIX? Referee: Ronald Torbert; Umpire: Mike Morton
