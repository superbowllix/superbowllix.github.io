A friend of mine had season tickets when our team went to the super bowl which entered him into a lottery. He still had to buy the tickets at face value but could have easily sold them for a $20,000 profit. They were close to the 50 yard line and pretty close to the field. 
I’ll be in Vegas for the Super Bowl. I purchased a hotel on the south side of the strip. I’ll go to the Super Bowl experience at Mandalay Bay on Saturday. If you think you’re going to make the trip and try to get tickets.. book all your reservations now! Also got tickets to guy fieri’s tailgate party and tickets for a viewing party.

The Super Bowl is a bucket list event. Not sure if the SB IN Vegas will be "bucket list". I am sure it's gonna be over-hyped and over-priced. Traffic might be bad. The stadium looks a bit out of the way, especially if you don't stay "south strip". I am thinking that going to a Super Bowl (or Wrestle Mania) in New Orleans could be "bucket list
