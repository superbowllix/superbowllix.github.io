        <p>There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. The closest they came to winning a Super Bowl was in 1991 and 2023 when they lost the Conference Championship. Detroit Lions Pages 
Caldwell may never have won a Super Bowl in Detroit, but the organization set him up for failure his final two seasons. 50: Search and destroy The Lions hired Ernie Accorsi to lead their general  
Yet while Detroit does not have a Super Bowl to its name, the franchise has won an NFL championship. In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. 
The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships  
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. 
The last time the Lions took home a championship was in 1957, prior to the first Super Bowl. The next season in 1958, the Lions traded their Hall of Fame QB Bobby Layne to the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
A look at the results for every Super Bowl, with the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers tied for the most all-time wins.  1957: Detroit Lions; 1956: New York Giants; 1955: Cleveland  
Before the Super Bowl even existed, the Lions were a serious force. They won championships in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957, with legends like Bobby Layne and Doak Walker running the show.

Free Press sports writer Dave Birkett highlights the best and worst performances of the Detroit Lions’ 48-42 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday at Ford Field.. The Lions (12-2) lost for the first time in exactly three months — when they also lost at home to Tampa Bay, 20-16, in Week 2 on Sept. 15 — and had their franchise-record 11-game win streak snapped.

Super Bowl LIX: Detroit Lions vs. Buffalo Bills. This Super Bowl showdown will be a rematch from earlier this season when the Buffalo Bills defeated the Lions at Ford Field. However, this time will be different. The Lions will have learned from their previous loss and will be determined to claim their first Super Bowl title. 
The Detroit Lions are on a roll! After winning three games in just 12 days, they’ve now secured 11 consecutive victories and are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record. As they march toward their ultimate goal of a Super Bowl championship, the Lions are in a prime position to finish strong. 
Rather than being a temporary piece that helped the Lions acquire a few extra draft picks in the trade with Los Angeles, he became the first piece on which Detroit built its Super Bowl aspirations. 
Detroit Lions defensive back Jamal Adams (25), Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown (14), Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell, Detroit Lions wide receiver Tim Patrick (17), Detroit Lions wide receiver Allen Robinson (8), and Detroit Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams (9) during an NFL football game against the Green Bay Packers on Dec. 5, 2024 in Detroit. 
I think the Lions win the next two games against the Bears and 49ers with relative ease; neither team can put up points like the Bills. It's the Week 18 showdown with the Vikings that will dictate their playoff success. If the Lions win that one and get a first-round bye, there's no reason they can't go to the Super Bowl.
