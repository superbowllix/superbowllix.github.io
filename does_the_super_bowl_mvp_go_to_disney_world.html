        <h2><strong>does the super bowl mvp go to disney world super bowl lvii quarter scores today</strong></h2>
        <p>Players named the MVP of the Super Bowl have for decades proclaimed that they're going to Disneyland or Disney World to celebrate their accomplishment as part of Disney's ad campaign. 
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. 
The Super Bowl Disney World trip is a decades-long NFL tradition. Since 1987, Super Bowl MVPs have been treated to a trip to "The Happiest Place on Earth. 
The beloved tradition dates back to Super Bowl XXI in 1987, according to Disney Parks Blog.As ESPN also reports, New York Giants quarterback and MVP Phil Simms was the first to shout the now  
One of the Super Bowl's most famous and long-established traditions has nothing do with football, let alone the NFL. Every year, the Super Bowl MVP proclaims "I'm going to Disney World!" to an  
After more than 37 years, a Super Bowl MVP will finally get his trip to Walt Disney World Resort thanks to former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning. 
Which players normally go to Disney World after the Super Bowl? Usually, the ‘MVP’ winner visits Disney World after the game, normally with a teammate and their families, which Mahomes has  
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. The most recent exception was in 2017, when Brady won his fourth of a record-setting five Super Bowl MVP trophies . 
And every year, the Super Bowl MVP does actually go to Disneyland in California, or another of Disney’s resorts, taking part in a parade in their honour a day after lofting the Lombardi. Watch Super Bowl LIX live on DAZN for just £0.99p 
Indeed, this year, the New England Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady and Super Bowl MVP and wide receiver Julian Edelman were featured in Disney's ad — and both players will soon head to Disney World. 
The catch phrase “I’m going to Disney World” first attached to the Super Bowl MVP in 1987, after Phil Simms won the award after his Giants beat the Broncos. Ten years ago, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (pictured) pulled the Disney duty by winning the Super Bowl XLV MVP award. This year, the Super Bowl MVP will not be going to Disney  
Super Bowl LIV MVP Patrick Mahomes in the parade at the Magic Kingdom the day after the game "I'm going to Disney World!" and "I'm going to Disneyland!" are advertising slogans used in a series of television commercials by The Walt Disney Company that began airing in 1987. [1] 
Unfortunately, we might have to wait until the iconic commercial airs to find out whether the Super Bowl MVP will visit the Disneyland Resort or the Walt Disney World Resort. Because the 2024 Super Bowl will be played in Las Vegas, I think it's likely that the MVP might visit Disneyland Park given that it is so closely located. I recommend  
However, with this year’s game in New Orleans, the pendulum seems poised to swing back to Walt Disney World in Florida. If the winning team does head to Walt Disney World, fans can expect a magical celebration on Main Street, U.S.A., featuring the Super Bowl MVP waving to crowds, perhaps joined by a few teammates. 
Credit: Disney. As most marketed celebrity visits to Disney parks go, the winning Super Bowl team’s trip the Walt Disney World Resort or Disneyland is not really comprised of an actual vacation  
Each year after the Super Bowl game, it has been a tradition for a player of the winning team (usually the MVP) to say that they going to Disneyland or Disney World, which is followed by their appearance soon after (often the next day) as part of a celebratory cavalcade. 
I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information from the Disney playbook. I just spoke to an MVP of a Cast Member who confirmed that, at the time of this writing, no official announcement has been made about the Super Bowl parade. However, this Cast Member also told me that a Super Bowl parade generally occurs the day after the big  
The "I'm going to Disney!" tradition didn't start until Super Bowl 21 in 1987. Twice in history there was no Disney theme park celebration in Orlando or Anaheim for the winning Super Bowl team. 
The 58th annual Super Bowl will be held on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Walt Disney World guests can watch the Super Bowl from the comfort of their in-room TVs or visit a variety of locations across Walt Disney World property, including many bars and lounges at Disney Springs and at Walt Disney World resorts. Stop by your resort  
This year, Super Bowl LIX will be held in New Orleans, so we anticipate that the winning MVP player should be headed to visit Disney World. In this year's game, the Kansas City Chiefs face off with the Philidelphia Eagles. We will share everything you need to know about the 2025 Super Bowl parade at Disney World! </p>
