        <p>A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. [5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952  
Yet while Detroit does not have a Super Bowl to its name, the franchise has won an NFL championship. In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. 
The Lions compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The team plays their home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit . The franchise was founded in Portsmouth, Ohio , as the Portsmouth Spartans in 1928 and joined the NFL on July 12, 1930. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. They have been in the NFL since 1930. This makes them one of the few teams without a Super Bowl win. They have four NFL championships before the Super Bowl started. These were in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. But, they have no Super Bowl wins. Understanding the Lions’ journey is key.

Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships, with the last coming in 1957. They are one of 14 teams in NFL history to have won four or more  
4-1 in pre-Super Bowl championships: Detroit does have championship history in football, but it has been 67 years. The Lions won their first championship in 1935 over the New York Giants. 
But they are the consensus Super Bowl 2025 betting favorite entering Week 13 of the 2024 NFL season, and lead the NFC at 10-1 entering Thursday's Thanksgiving feast vs. the Chicago Bears. 
Before the Super Bowl even existed, the Lions were a serious force. They won championships in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957, with legends like Bobby Layne and Doak Walker running the show. The 1957 win? 
Have the Detroit Lions Ever Won the Super Bowl? (The Lions fell short of an SB appearance in the 2023 season. Photo: Junfu Han-USA TODAY Sports) The Detroit Lions have never won the Super Bowl. They also have never played in the Super Bowl. Since 1970, Detroit has only appeared in the NFC Championship Game twice.

Allen Park — OK, you know about the Detroit Lions’ injury situation, but every team in football battles injuries to some degree, right? Part of any great season is overcoming adversity. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the injured list for the other top-six Super Bowl contenders. 
The Lions have been left out of the Super Bowl party for over 66 years. Detroit has long awaited the return of a top football team, and the 2024 Lions are just that.
