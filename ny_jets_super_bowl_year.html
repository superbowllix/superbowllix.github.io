        <p>New York Jets, 56 years – Won Super Bowl III, 1968 season [86] [n 8] Minnesota Vikings, 48 years – Lost Super Bowl XI, 1976 season; Miami Dolphins, 40 years – Lost Super Bowl XIX, 1984 season; Washington Commanders, 33 years – Won Super Bowl XXVI, 1991 season (played as Washington Redskins) 
Super Bowl III is regarded as one of the greatest upsets in both American football history and in the history of professional sports. [4] The 19-point underdog American Football League (AFL) champion New York Jets defeated the National Football League (NFL) champion Baltimore Colts by a score of 16–7. [5] 
The New York Jets are one of the oldest teams in the NFL and play in the AFC East Division. Unlike their counterparts the New York Giants, the Jets have a comparatively bleak Super Bowl history  
The New York Jets last played a home playoff game on Jan 4, 2003, nearly 23 years ago, when they hosted the Colts in the Wild Card Round of the 2002 NFL playoffs, in which the Jets scored a 41-0 win. When was the last time the Jets lost a playoff game?

The Jets were the first AFL team to win the Super Bowl when they upset the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, 16-7. The result was one of the reasons why the AFL and NFL merged. It has been 54 years since the Jets hoisted the championship trophy, and while they have been close to returning to the Super Bowl, the Jets have fallen short.

They have squared off only 11 times in 64 years, but they have faced each other four times in the past four years, counting the Chiefs 38-35 victory over the Eagles in the Super Bowl two years ago. 
He played in New York for seven more seasons and spent his final year as a member of the Los Angeles Rams. Namath cemented his legacy in 1969 when he guaranteed his heavy underdog Jets would win Super Bowl III before defeating the NFL's Baltimore Colts in one of the greatest sports upsets of all time.
