The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have won one Super Bowl in franchise history. The Eagles were champions of the 2017 NFL season after beating the Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. Before the Super Bowl era, the Eagles won three NFL Championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960.
