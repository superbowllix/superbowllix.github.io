        <h2><strong>are super bowl rings made before the game super bowl 2025 logo colors teams</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl ring design has grown increasingly elaborate and gaudy, each ring’s aesthetic more extravagant than the last. The weeks-long design process begins before the game even kicks off. 
Jostens, the brand known for sports apparel, graduation gowns and class rings, is the maker behind 38 of the last 58 Super Bowl rings. Tiffany &amp; Co. has also made a few rings, including the 1987  
Rings from the first 57 Super Bowls Joe Theismann's NFL rings (2006); his 1983 NFC Championship ring (left), and his 1982 Super Bowl XVII Championship ring (right). The Super Bowl ring is an award in the National Football League given to the team members of the winning team of the league's annual championship game, the Super Bowl. 
Interestingly, both the winning and losing teams in the Super Bowl receive rings. The champions’ rings proudly bear the Super Bowl designation, while the runners-up receive “Conference Champions” rings. But apart from this material value, the Super Bowl ring symbolizes hard work, loyalty, and teamwork on its way to the zenith of the NFL. 
While Jostens have yet to work with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the company has made six Super Bowl rings for Tom Brady, who joined the Buccaneers in 2020 after 20 seasons with the New England Patriots. 
For decades, the Super Bowl rings were made from gold and diamonds, but the 2010 Green Bay Packers rings were the first to be set in platinum. The NFL requires every Super Bowl ring design to  
A New England Patriots Super Bowl LI ring made for a family member of Tom Brady’s, for example, went for a record-breaking $344,927 at auction—and it had only 265 diamonds (compared to Brady’s 283) and was about 10% smaller than the quarterback’s ring. But one thing’s for certain: A championship memento doesn’t come cheap. 
While there isn’t a hard-and-fast number to how much a Super Bowl ring is worth, depending on the circumstances and details of the ring, experts generally appraise them between $30,000 and  
7.) The players on the Steelers were upset with the size of their Super Bowl XL rings. By 2002, winning Super Bowl rings were tipping the scales around 60-70 grams in weight. That changed when the Patriots made the biggest Super Bowl ring ever – when they won their second Super Bowl. Their ring from Super Bowl XXXVIII weighed around 100 grams. 
The game-time temperature was 53 degrees, and it would be 26 years before the Super Bowl would be played in such chilly conditions again. But the 49ers were hotter than July, outscoring the Dolphins by a combined 31-6 in the second and third quarters, and cruising to their second Super Bowl title under Bill Walsh. 
Ben Roethlisberger won two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 and 2009, becoming one of the youngest quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl in his first victory. “Big Ben” was known  
The favorite manufacturer of these pieces is the custom ring house Jostens, which is behind 38 of the 58 Super Bowl rings to date, including the first in 1967 and last year's for the Kansas City  
"Super Bowl rings have always been admired but the way Jerry did it, it made the owners take off too.  Before departing for the game, Ward sketched a picture.  All six of the Patriots  
The Highland Mint in Melbourne has provided the Super Bowl flip coin since prior to Super Bowl 28 on Jan. 30, 1994, when Dallas faced Buffalo. If you’re wondering, the flip was “tails.” 
Therefore, it has become a tradition to award Super Bowl rings to these hardworking individuals as well. Notable Exceptions. While the majority of individuals associated with the winning team receive Super Bowl rings, there are some notable exceptions. For example, players who were released or traded before the Super Bowl may not receive a ring. 
The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zircona stones (which resemble diamonds). When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII, the players and coaches received rings with a diamond-centered Lombardi trophy.
