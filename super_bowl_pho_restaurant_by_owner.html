We had dinner at Pho SuperBowl &amp; Tea Station while staying in SD. The restaurant is clean, bright and spacious. The service was nice, but the only drawback was that the food took forever to come out which is not ideal with young kids. +Thai tea was $6 (a little steep for a restaurant IMO). It was just ok. 
At Super Pho &amp; Boba, we bring the heart of Vietnam to every bowl and every sip. Our mission is to honor the traditions of Vietnamese home cooking, blending time-honored recipes with the freshest ingredients to create authentic flavors that satisfy the soul.

The name sounded like NFL of Pho or something. I had to try Pho Super Bowl to see how big their food was. I ordered Lemongrass Pork with 2 Spring Rolls on Vermicelli ($19.75) it was big enough for 2 servings. And yes, this place is like NFL version of Pho it's gigantic! I was freaking out at the portion when it first came. 
Pho: the broth is so calming and beautiful! I added some thai chilis with fish sauce and it really rounded out the flavor. Summer rolls: delicious and super fresh Beef Jerky- a little too tough for my liking, won't be getting this guy again Pad Kee Mao- Didn't have enough flavor for me The pho and dancing shrimp are everything! </p>
