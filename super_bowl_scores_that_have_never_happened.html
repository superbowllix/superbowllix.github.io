        <p>Missing Game Scores in Pro Football History. A summary of possible game scores up to 70-70 that have never happened in NFL/AFL/AAFC history. Looking for all games with a particular score? Search for any game score in pro football history, or see every final score that has ever happened. 
This dream Super Bowl has nearly happened so many times. In 2010, the year Rodgers led the Packers to the Super Bowl, the Patriots were the Number 1 seed in the AFC but got upset in the playoffs by Mark Sanchez(!) and the Jets. In 2011 Brady got the Patriots to the Super Bowl, but the 15-1 one-seeded Packers got upset by a 9-7 Giants team. 
The Super Bowl is one of the greatest sporting events in NFL history. It matches the best NFL teams up against one another in a game viewed by millions each year 
A few times every NFL season, you see final scores that have never happened in the history of the league. This is the 95-year history of this fine art. By Jon Bois Dec 7, 2016 
The Jets' most recent championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002  
It is important to note that specific score outcomes are impossible due to the scoring rules in place. Specifically, results such as 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, and 7-1 are not viable. This is  
We had heard that the final score of the Super Bowl -- 43-8, as you know -- had never happened in NFL history (at least not in any game recorded after 1920).  20-17 is the most common score  
Super Bowl matchups by year. Super Bowl 1: Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10; Super Bowl 2: Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14; Super Bowl 3: New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7

The Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars are the only teams to have never appeared in a Super Bowl. Here is a year-by-year list of every Super Bowl: 
It is important to note that specific score outcomes are impossible due to the scoring rules in place. Specifically, results such as 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, and 7-1 are not viable. This is  
In sports, a scorigami (a portmanteau of score and origami) is a final score that has never happened before in a sport or league's history. [1] The term was originated by sportswriter Jon Bois for American football scores in the National Football League (NFL) and is primarily used in this context; it has also been applied sparingly across other  
Scorigami is a concept thought up by Jon Bois. It is the art of building final scores that have never happened before in NFL history. Due to the unique nature of how points are scored in (American) Football, where it is impossible to score 1 point on its own, as well as the rarity of the 2 point safety and 8 point touchdown and 2 point conversion, there are a lot of scores that are possible  
Not good enough to be the greatest Super Bowl matchup that never happened, though. Below are the top 10 dream Super Bowls the world missed out on, based on a variety of factors -- I looked at top  
Football fans have become enthusiastic about “scorigamis” in recent seasons — final scores that have never happened before in NFL history.  The second Super Bowl scorigami happened in  
A Super Bowl shutout. It would be even more rare to see a shutout. Every team in every Super Bowl has scored, and all but five managed to score at least one touchdown. 
Football fans have become enthusiastic about “scorigamis” in recent seasons — final scores that have never happened before in NFL history.  The second Super Bowl scorigami happened in  
A final score (both teams) that have never happened before. For example when the Seahawks won the super bowl against Denver the score was 43-8. Never before in any NFL game in history of the NFL was there ever that exact score (of the thousands and thousands of games played)! </p>
