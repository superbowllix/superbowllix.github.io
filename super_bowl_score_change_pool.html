        <h2><strong>super bowl score change pool super bowl viewership women</strong></h2>
        <p>Find out the expected value of your super bowl squares pool based on the frequency of score changes in NFL games. Enter your own pool rules and see the payouts for each box number. 
Under the "Every Score Pays" option, instead of waiting for the end of each quarter, the pool pays out every time the score changes, even extra points and two point conversions. I am not sure if there is a standard payout per score, but for the numbers below I am assuming that 5% of the pool is paid out with each score change. 
This will occur for ten (10) score changes only. If the game has fewer than 10 score changes, the remainder will be split amongst the winners from this category (a TD = 6 and is a score change. The extra point is another score change.) If there is less than 10 score changes, the remaining money will be split amongst those winning score change  
Score Change Payments - 19 score changes @ $50 each The Game Begins and the score is 0-0 (no payout). The AFC team kicks a field goal and now the score is 3-0. Whomever has the AFC 3-NFC 0 square will receive $50. Then the NFC team scores a touchdown and the score is now 3-6. Whomever has the AFC 3- NFC 6 square will receive $50. 
This is the "Superbowl Score Change squares Pool". $400/square. Enclosed below are the rules, followed by how to register and lock in your square(s) on the website. SUPER BOWL POOL RULES: This pool is based upon the quarterly and final results of Super Bowl 59, to be played Sunday, February 9th, 2025. 
3. After all the score change winners have been paid, 1st &amp; 3rd quarter scores will get $500, then the remainder of monies will get split evenly between the half time and end-of-game winners. 4. 0-0 is automatic winner!! SUPER BOWL "MINI" POOL RULES. 1. $50 per box. 2. You win $150 for every score change. For example, touchdown, 6-0, winner  
Payout is $200 per score change. Example: AFC team scores a touchdown first and also kicks the extra point. AFC 6, NFC 0 would win followed by AFC 7 NFC 0. The last score would win what is left in the pot, if 25 score changes did not occur. The pool ends after the 25th score change should this occur. 
Super Bowl squares rules The game is played on a 10x10 grid with a "home" team row on top and the "visitor" column on the side. So in this year's matchup, the Chiefs would be across the top and  
Example, if the score by the end of the first quarter is 49ers the leading the Chiefs 13-10, then whoever has the No. 3 on the NFC side and No. 0 on the AFC side is the winner of that quarter. 
How do you set up Super Bowl squares? To play Super Bowl squares, you must make a 10x10 grid with 100 “squares”. A printable version of this template can be found here. If making the squares yourself, include a blank row and blank column for drawing numbers. Place one team on top and the other team on the side. How do Super Bowl squares work?

Super Bowl 2023. Sunday Feb 11, 2024. Conference Champ. Sunday Jan 28, 2024. Thanksgiving NFL. Thursday Nov 23, 2023. Christmas NFL. Monday Dec 25, 2023 
If there are more than 16 score changes, the pool will be depleted, and no further payouts will be made after the 16th score change. The average number of score changes in the prior 11 Super Bowls is 14. By allocating for 16 score changes, if the average of 14 score changes takes place, the 14th and final score change would pay $2100.

Here is how to play Super Bowl squares in 2025, including a complete guide to the rules for your printable grid, the best data-backed numbers and more tips to win during Super Bowl 59. 
1. The average score in the NFL is 24-21 which equates to roughly 15 score changes. To be conservative, we allocated for 20 score changes or 400 per score change. 2. When the game begins, whoever holds 0-0 wins 400. 3. Every score change thereafter wins as well, i.e. field goal 3-0. 4. Touchdowns win on both the touchdown &amp; the PAT, i.e. 6-0  
0/0 is an automatic winner in the score change pool. The final winner will receive the pool share amount, plus the remaining balance of the pool. A single box can win multiple times. If there are more than 20 score changes in Super Bowl 50 the points will be divided evenly among all score change winners. Payment must be made with Venmo this year. 
Each week’s spread picks are graded by the line as of when the person entered their picks. This will create situations in which a movement of the line can result in two participants having the correct pick but with different teams chosen during an individual game.
