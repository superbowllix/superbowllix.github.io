The commercial, promoting the home-sharing platform Vrbo, was aired during the Super Bowl and showcases unconventional accommodations, including farm animals, against the backdrop of the traditional Newfoundland and Labrador folk song, "I’se The B’y."

After Newfoundlanders took offence to an ad during one of the biggest annual TV event of the year, Target knew it had to move quickly to craft a response.

UMMM the @vrbo Ad that uses the song Ise da By during Super Bowl is SO RUDE. Insinuating rural travel is somehow less desirable – bad take.
