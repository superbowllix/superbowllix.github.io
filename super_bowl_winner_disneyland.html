        <p>A year later, three Los Angeles Rams players -- Matthew Stafford, Aaron Donald and Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp-- rode down Main Street, U.S.A., at nearby Disneyland. In 2023, Super Bowl LVII MVP  
In his 1998 memoir Work in Progress, Disney CEO Michael Eisner credited his wife, Jane, with the idea for the campaign. [5] According to Eisner, during the January 1987 grand opening for the Star Tours attraction at Disneyland, the couple dined with Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who in December 1986 had piloted the first aircraft to fly around the world without stopping or refueling. 
Sometimes the Super Bowl’s standout performer offers a slight variation on the theme, saying they’re going to Walt Disney World. It comes across as an off-the-cuff moment in the celebratory hubbub after the NFL’s showpiece game has culminated, with confetti still falling and the hordes of players staff and media still flooding the field. 
2024 Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes at Disneyland Resort Posted: Tuesday February 13, 2024 9:10pm ET by WDWMAGIC Staff MVP Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates Super Bowl LVIII victory with a cavalcade complete with Mickey Mouse and his pals down Main Street U.S.A. at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., Feb. 12, 2024.

After a win in last year's Super Bowl game, Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes declared that he was "going to Disneyland." Interestingly, about a decade before, Mahomes sent out a tweet  
Disneyland has announced that the winner of Super Bowl LVIII will be celebrated at the Disneyland Resort on Monday, February 12, 2024. If you’ve ever been at a Disney theme park on the Monday following Super Bowl Sunday, you’ll know that this is typically a quick presentation where the game’s MVP rides down the parade route on a special  
The winner of Super Bowl 58 will be headed toDisneyland! The post-Super Bowl celebration can be traced back to 1987 when Phil Simms uttered the famous line “I’m going to Disney World”. Simms and his family were then treated to a day at Magic Kingdom and a tradition was born. 
Patrick Mahomes, 28, returned to Disneyland in California to celebrate his Super Bowl win on February 12! Less than 24 hours after the Kansas City Chiefs dominated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in  
The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will face off in Las Vegas on Sunday, February 11. It’s a tradition for the Super Bowl winners to then visit Disneyland or Walt Disney World.

The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade on Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. With this year’s game being held in New Orleans, closer to the East Coast, it makes sense to celebrate the winner at Walt Disney World rather than Disneyland. Who do you think is going to win the Super Bowl LIX? 
Super Bowl Sunday and the day after provide two very different Disneyland experiences. If you want to join in football celebrations, Super Bowl Sunday has festive energy and special merchandise. But the crowds are heavy all day. Returning the day after allows you to see the Super Bowl parade and players, but also draws peak Disneyland attendance. 
The Disneyland Super Bowl Parade will take place on Monday, February 12, celebrating the winner of Super Bowl LVIII. Looking to last year as an example of what to expect, there was a processional down the length of the parade route with MVP Patrick Mahomes on a float with Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse. 
Last year, with the big game in Las Vegas, Disneyland hosted the Super Bowl-winning Chiefs. Disney World Is Getting Ready. In anticipation of Monday’s festivities, Walt Disney World took to social media and announced they were looking forward to celebrating the winner of Super Bowl LIX.

The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom. 
Making true on that post-win announcement, the three Los Angles Rams players will be at Disneyland Resort today, Monday February 14, 2022 celebrating their team’s Super Bowl LVI victory “with
