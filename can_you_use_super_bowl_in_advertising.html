        <h2><strong>can you use super bowl in advertising super bowl wins by giants</strong></h2>
        <p>The 2025 Super Bowl LIX is quickly approaching and many marketers use this key moment to promote their product or service — even if it’s on a smaller scale than an ad spot. If you are a content creator for a brand (or your own blog), chances are that you’ve already done or have thought about doing this. 
Nevertheless, the NFL objects to any unlicensed third-party advertising that refers to the Super Bowl.® For example, the use in advertising of taglines such as “Stock Up for the Super Bowl” for beer or snacks or “Get the Best View of the Super Bowl” for big-screen TVs has routinely led to the prompt issuance of cease-and-desist letters  
The term "Super Bowl" is not just a phrase casually tossed around – it's protected by trademark laws. But wait, there's more to this story. Let's explore how this impacts advertising and what you need to know to play it safe. Can I use Super Bowl in advertising? When it comes to advertising, using the term "Super Bowl" can be tricky. 
In what is a 2022 update to Oxenford’s annual warning, he touches on a number of areas to be aware of where legal issues may arise. The broad stroke takeaway remains the same year after year: You can use the words “Super Bowl” for news and editorial content but not for any advertising and promotional tie-ins. 
The SUPER BOWL® trademark is not the only one you can’t use without a license; if you were planning on advertising an event or deal, like a contest or giveaway, that involves the Super Bowl, you want to avoid also using the following terms: “Pro Bowl,” “Super Sunday”, The Super Bowl logo, “NFL”, “AFC” or “NFC,” “The  
The tight regulations are part of the reason why the NFL’s ad space for the game is so lucrative: In 2010, Budweiser signed a six-year Super Bowl sponsorship deal worth over $1 billion, while 30  
Nominate fair use is a legal doctrine that allows you to use a trademark when the product (here, the football game) is tough to identify without using the trademark ("Super Bowl"). But even under nominative fair use, you can't use the trademark gratuitously, and you can't suggest a sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder (the NFL). 
To many companies, the Super Bowl is advertising's biggest playing field. According to industry magazine Ad Age, a total of $4.9 billion has been spent on ads for the first 51 years of the game. 
Don’t use the Super Bowl or Super Sunday name in sponsoring or promoting gameday-related events, such as “XYZ’s Super Bowl Party.” Apply the same caution to teams . All NFL team names ( e.g. , “49ers,” “Chiefs,” etc. ) and nicknames (and logos), like “Super Bowl,” are registered trademarks, so the same considerations of  
The cost for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial has hit new heights, with ads being sold for about $8 million in the weeks leading up to the game, according to Ad Meter. 
Nevertheless, the NFL objects to any unlicensed third-party advertising that refers to the Super Bowl.® For example, the use in advertising of taglines such as “Stock Up for the Super Bowl” for beer or snacks or “Get the Best View of the Super Bowl” for big-screen TVs has routinely led to the prompt issuance of cease-and-desist letters  
The media outlet reported in 2019 that Anheuser-Busch spends around $250 million a year to be the only alcohol company to advertise during the gamer and use Super Bowl branding on its products. 
NFL’s tactics don’t change the fact that you can totally say “Super Bowl.” The NFL has trademarked the terms “Super Bowl” and “Super Sunday,” but that doesn’t mean it actually controls all rights to the phrase. Instinctually, we all know that can’t be how the law works. We see and use trademarked names for things all the time. 
Google Bets That Super Bowl Can Turbocharge Gemini AI Business. The tech giant has a national spot about a man using Gemini AI to help prepare for an interview, and is buying 50 local ads in 50  
Companies can’t use the name "Super Bowl" in their advertising because it is trademarked. Sadly for the little guys, the NFL has actually trademarked the term “Super Bowl.”

Google’s Gemini Super Bowl ads push AI as a tool you can use every day. The ads highlight the very different ways you can use Gemini, whether you want to talk to yourself about parenting or  
Booking.com's Super Bowl ad campaign will air during the Big Game's fourth quarter and is designed to show how the booking site can help you get your vacation rental or hotel exactly right and  
You can make fun of the fact that you cannot say the phrase “Super Bowl” (for example, by bleeping it out) Advertisements Produced By Third Parties Before accepting pre-produced advertisements relating to a conference championship game or the Super Bowl, your station should confirm that the advertiser has the necessary rights to use NFL  
There is a trademark concept called “nominative fair use” that allows others to use a trademarked term when there is simply no better way to refer to it. But that concept does not extend to commercial use of the term. In summary, you can discuss the Super Bowl and do news stories about the Super Bowl, all while referring to it as the Super  </p>
