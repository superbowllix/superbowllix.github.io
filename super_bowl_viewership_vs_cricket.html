        <h2><strong>super bowl viewership vs cricket super bowl nfl revenue</strong></h2>
        <p>How does the Super bowl viewership compare to the ICC World Cup 2019 final? The ICC World Cup 2019 was played between England and New Zealand. It turned out to be the most closely-fought match in cricket history, where a total of 2 Super Overs weren't enough to decide the winner of the match. 
Despite losing early wickets, India would end up winning by 29 runs on their way to capturing their first Cricket World Cup since 1983. Matchups between India and Pakistan among the most watched cricket matches have averaged 328.6 million global viewers. To compare, the most watched Super Bowl ever attracted 123.7 million total viewers. 
In 2023, the Super Bowl LVII raked in 115.1 million viewers on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming networks, which helped the event earn its place in history as the most-watched Super Bowl of all time. One of the most interesting facets about Super Bowl viewership is that not all viewers are sports enthusiasts. 
The Cricket World Cup, which concludes with a New Zealand-England final on Sunday, will be the most-watched sporting event of the year — 20 times the audience of the Super Bowl. But virtually no  
Huge sporting events like World Cups and The Olympics often bring such viewership. But what if I tell you that the sport that featured in this event isn’t even popular anywhere outside the US. The Super Bowl game between The Chiefs and 49ers became the most watched live broadcast ever drawing an average viewership of 123.4 million. 
The Superbowl last year had 113 million viewers with nearly 50 million households tuned in to the most anticipated game of the year. The difference in numbers is quite significant, however, while addressing the importance that a cricket match between India and Pakistan has, it is the emotional aspect that makes it much bigger than the Super Bowl. 
It is over four times the size of the Super Bowl in viewership but one-third of the FIFA World Cup. The IPL makes it comfortably to a rough list of the top 10 global sports events Topics : Indian Premier League FIFA World Cup India cricket team 
According to Roadtrips.com five billion people watch the World Cup Final, while the Super Bowl is actually the 8th most-watched event with 115 million views. Finishing above NFL's showpiece are the Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, Women's World Cup, Olympic Games, Winter Games and the Champions League Final. 
The most watched Super Bowl of all time was 2015’s Super Bowl XLIX, where 114.44 million viewers tuned in to watch the New England Patriots defeat the Seattle Seahawks. 
1- Viewership for India v/s Pakistan ICC World Cup 2015 match. 2-Viewership for New England Patriots v/s Seattle Seahawks Superbowl XLIX match. Both matches reflect the highest ever viewership for each sport. 
But the team showed up in the second half, and Mahomes led his team to another Super Bowl win and got his second Super Bowl MVP in the process. The most exciting play was the game-winning drive with Mahomes’ 26-yard run to set up the game-winning field goal late in the fourth quarter. And, yes, he did it all on one leg. Bottom Line: Super Bowl 
I wonder what the economic value on 518 Indians watching a cricket match is compared to the 100 million who watch the Super Bowl. Reply reply faceisamapoftheworld 
FIFA World Cup 2006 vs. World Cup 2010; World Cup vs. Super Bowl vs. Olympics: The pinnacle of sports?

World Cup vs Super Bowl Viewership. The 2021 Super Bowl between Tom Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs was the least-watched Super Bowl since 2008. Its 96.4  
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
The Super Bowl had a viewership of 111 million. By this logic, the average Super Bowl eyeball is worth 233 times more than the average India Pak eyeball. 233 times!!!  Cricket's Global  
The regression model alone predicts Super Bowl viewership to be at 117.3 million for this year. However, when accounting for the Chiefs and Eagles viewership adjustment factors, that number jumps  
Best estimate for watching is in the range of 100 to 150 million viewers.  Compared to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas last year, hotel rooms are harder to come by as the selection is more limited  
Last year, a cricket match between India and Pakistan saw more than 400 million viewers tune in worldwide. That's nearly three times the global audience for the Super Bowl 
Following a graphic that contrasted Super Bowl viewing with FIFA World Cup watching, the sports world had a lot to say on Twitter. An infographic comparing the viewership of both big sporting events was published by the well-known Twitter account @nocontextfooty. The image shows the viewership of the Super Bowl to that of the FIFA World Cup. </p>
