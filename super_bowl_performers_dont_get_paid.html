The Super Bowl halftime show, despite hosting some of the world's biggest stars and attracting massive audiences, does not pay its performers. However, there's a specific reason for it. What began as a way to keep fans entertained during the Super Bowl's midgame break gradually evolved into a major spectacle. 
Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg at Coachella. The pair will be paid a union-mandated minimum fee for performing at Super Bowl LVI Getty. The NFL's vice president of communications, Brian McCarthy, says  
Usher attends the 2022 Beloved Benefit at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on July 07, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia. Marcus Ingram/Getty. No. Like past performers, no one is paid for their halftime show performance. 
Artists Don't Get Paid for Performing at the Super Bowl Halftime Show – Here's Why Despite being one of the most sought-after entertainment stages, the Super Bowl halftime show does not pay its performers. Rather, there is a significant benefit to the opportunity that extends beyond financial gain. Even though it features some of the 
When Beyonce first performed at the Super Bowl without a fee in 2013, production costs alone amounted to $600,000. The halftime show is a great chance for artists to boost their music sales. 
The Super Bowl is one of the largest events that happens once a year bringing in over 100 million views and over $500 million in revenue but the NFL does not pay its halftime performers. The NFL sees it as the artists will be "receiving about $24 million to $30 million worth of exposure, assuming the same rate of value as companies paying for

Covered. So while they don't walk away with cash in hand, they definitely aren’t out of pocket. It’s All About the Exposure. Performing at the Super Bowl is like hitting the jackpot for publicity. Take Usher, for example. He was paid precisely £0 for the 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show, but the exposure gave him a massive boost. 
Artists don't get paid to perform at the Super Bowl, whether for the pre-kickoff songs (the national anthem, "Live Every Voice and Sing" and "America the Beautiful") or the halftime show. 
The fact that artists don’t get paid surprises many people. We’re used to seeing performers like Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Maroon 5, and Coldplay command millions of dollars for their performances. However, it does make sense from an economic perspective. 
While Perry and other halftime performers don’t pay to play (yet), at least one other artist — The Weeknd — contributed millions of his own money to cover production costs. One of the artist’s managers told Billboard in 2021 that The Weeknd forked over $7 million to fund his elaborate vision for the show. 
NFL spokesperson Joanna Hunter told Forbes in 2016: "We do not pay the artists. We cover expenses and production costs." It is estimated that when Beyoncé first performed at the Super Bowl for  
How much do Super Bowl performers get paid?  While performers don't receive direct compensation, the production costs for the halftime show are substantial. Recent performances have seen  
While the Super Bowl halftime performers don't get a big paycheck, the rare exposure they historically earn from the show has made it a coveted position. Last year—following the most-watched Super Bowl of all time—Usher's hit song "Yeah!"

The “Yeah!” singer was the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show performer, following Rihanna in 2023. While the short concert is known to be one of the most-viewed TV broadcasts every year, the  
That makes perfect timing for, 8-time-Grammy award winner, Usher as his 9th studio album drops in 2024 and his residency in Las Vegas continues. We don't know yet who will join Usher on the stage, but with a long list of friends in the music industry, we're sure it will be good. What do you think—should Super Bowl performers get paid? 
That's because the Super Bowl performers don't really get paid by the NFL to perform.None of the performers that performed before and during the big game — Usher, Reba McEntire, Post Malone and  
According to a Sports Illustrated report, Usher was paid "$671 for the actual performance last year and about $1,800 for the rehearsals leading up to the Super Bowl." </p>
