Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
The Eagles won their first Super Bowl in 2018 over the New England Patriots. It was an improbable victory given the team started their backup quarterback, Nick Foles. Police greased the poles in

The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
The Eagles were 1–4 against the Brady/Belichick era Patriots prior to this game (preseason notwithstanding), including Super Bowl XXXIX, their one win being a 35–28 win at Gillette Stadium in December during their relatively weak 2015 season, where after falling behind 14–0, they proceeded to rally for 35 points and hold them down to only

This year’s game is a rematch of Super Bowl LVII, when Kansas City defeated Philadelphia 38-35. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes rallied the Chiefs from a 10-point halftime deficit to top the Eagles. 
Nick Foles completed his fairy-tale season by leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a win in Super Bowl LII and being named the game's MVP. Jeffri Chadiha chronicles an unbelievable run.

The Philadelphia Eagles have reached the Super Bowl for the fifth time and are looking for their first Vince Lombardi Trophy. The franchise has deep roots in the NFL and was a powerhouse during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Eagles will be playing the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl for the second time in three seasons. 
Jalen Hurts has held a press conference every day this week in the build-up to the Super Bowl and the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback has somehow managed to keep his name out of the headlines

How Many Super Bowls Have the Eagles Played In? Super Bowl 15 — January 1981; Super Bowl 39 — February 2005; Super Bowl 52 — February 2018; Super Bowl 57 — February 2023; Although the Eagles have appeared in four Super Bowls, they also made several championship appearances in the pre-Super Bowl era. 
Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, Nelson Agholor, Zach Ertz, Trey Burton, Brent Celek, Jay Ajayi, LeGarrette Blount, and Corey Clement all had critical roles as skill-position players in the win.
