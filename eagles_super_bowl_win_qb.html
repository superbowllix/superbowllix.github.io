        <h2><strong>eagles super bowl win qb nfl super bowl 2025 kendrick</strong></h2>
        <p>Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are the only starting quarterbacks to have won Super Bowls for two NFL teams, while Craig Morton and Kurt Warner are the only other quarterbacks to have started for a second team. Jim McMahon won a second Super Bowl ring having been a backup on the Brett Favre-led Green Bay Packers team that won Super Bowl XXXI. 
Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33  Philadelphia had overcome a late-season ACL tear by QB Carson Wentz and  
The Eagles have won just one Super Bowl during their franchise's history. That came in Super Bowl 52, which was played in 2018 as part of the 2017 NFL playoffs. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
Philadelphia won its first and only Lombardi Trophy in the 2017 season, when backup quarterback Nick Foles and the Eagles took down the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots in Super Bowl 52  
In the win that brought the Eagles their one and, so far, only Lombardi Trophy, Foles completed 28-of-43 passes for 373 passing yards, three touchdowns, one interception, and a 106.1 passer rating  
The Eagles defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and Philly's quarterback Nick Foles was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award. Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl win years: What years did  
Foles’ TD pass to Ertz moments later gave the Eagles the lead for good. There have only been three 4 th-quarter 4 th-down completed passes in Super Bowl history by a team that was trailing, and Foles’ completion to Ertz is the only one that led to a win. One of the most clutch throws in Super Bowl history. 10.

Defensive Coordinator: Jim Schwartz. Other Notable Asst.: John DeFilippo (Quarterbacks), Ken Flajole (Linebackers), Mike Groh (Wide Receivers), Press Taylor (Off. 
When Super Bowl 59 kicks off, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will become one of just two active players to start in multiple Super Bowls, joining his counterpart, Patrick Mahomes. The two signal  
There was the overlooked quarterback, the underestimated head coach, and the demoted general manager, all of whom banded together to form the foundation of Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl-winning team. The 2017-18 Eagles embodied the spirit and the persona and the bite of their hometown. A team of  
What Is the Eagles’ Super Bowl Record? The Eagles have a 1-3 record in the Super Bowls they’ve appeared in. How Many Super Bowls Have the Eagles Won? The Eagles have won one Super Bowl. Super Bowl Wins by the Eagles. While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. 
This was the second time the Eagles and Patriots battled in a Super Bowl; when they met in Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots won 24–21. Backup quarterback Nick Foles was named Super Bowl MVP . 
The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, who was considering walking away from professional football just last offseason, won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award after leading Philly past the  
Nick Foles completed his fairy-tale season by leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a win in Super Bowl LII and being named the game's MVP. Jeffri Chadiha chronicles an unbelievable run. 
Their first Super Bowl win came seven years ago, when quarterback Nick Foles and coach Doug Pederson led the 2017 Eagles to a 41-33 defeat of the New England Patriots. 
Ahead of the Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl matchup, Chris Simms and Ahmed Fareed discuss the top non-QBs in the game, including Saquon Barkley, Chris Jones, Trent McDuffie, Jalen Carter and AJ Brown. 
Now he will try to become the fourth quarterback to win the NFL’s ultimate prize as a starting quarterback after losing his first Super Bowl start. Hurts came close two years ago when Philadelphia lost 38-35 to Kansas City in Glendale, Arizona. With a win next week in New Orleans, Hurts would become the first quarterback since John Elway 27  </p>
