        <h2><strong>how many jesus ads in super bowl final super bowl 2025 medio tiempo</strong></h2>
        <p>In between star-studded advertisements and a whole lot of football, this year’s Super Bowl watchers are being taken to church. “He Gets Us,” a campaign to promote Jesus and Christianity, is  
The Super Bowl had at least four offerings from religious organizations. "He Gets Us" scored two ads during the game.  According to the "He Gets Us," campaign, the ad represented Jesus' belief  
While the Super Bowl will represent the largest splash their ads have made, the campaign has already made a tremendous impact. Since the spring of 2022, He Gets Us ads have made nearly 6.5 billion  
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Foot Washing,” the 60-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” 
The ad will explore “how Jesus redefined true greatness.” Lerma, the lead creative agency behind He Gets Us’ previous Super Bowl spots, created the 2025 ad as well. 
More than just Super Bowl commercials, the He Gets Us campaign first surfaced in March 2022 and has been causing waves through TV spots, billboards, and digital ads. 
It’s becoming a Super Bowl tradition: He Gets Us, the billion-dollar effort to overhaul the public image of Jesus, the Son of God, will be back on the airwaves during Super Bowl LIX. Greg Miller  
Over the past few years, entertainment has influenced fans and supporters in many aspects, including Religion. The "He Gets Us" campaign is a committed endeavor to spread awareness about Jesus and Christianity. With a massive $100 million media investment, the campaign is making a big splash by running two ads during The LVII Super Bowl 2023. 
But it’s very well-funded: The 30-second and minute-long “He Gets Us” ad spots that will run during the Super Bowl should amount to a total cost of $20 million, according to Ad Age. And the  
The "He Gets Us" campaign is spending millions of dollars on its Super Bowls ads to promote Jesus. NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Josiah Daniels about the campaign and its purpose. 
He Gets Us, a $100 million campaign reimagining Jesus’ message, is airing a 60-second “True Greatness” spot at Super Bowl 2025. Learn how the nonprofit Come Near, Jon Batiste’s Love Riot Festival, and AI-driven art are shaping this year’s faith-based outreach. 
I remember seeing dianetics commercials back in the late 80s early 90s like constantly. Back when there were only 30 channels or so. And maybe less than 10 channels were only worth watching 
5.8K votes, 1.4K comments. 17M subscribers in the television community. I feel this way not only about churches, but also about political parties, companies, charities etc. 
The two Super Bowl ads created by the campaign will focus on “the behavior Jesus modeled in relationship and conflict,” He Gets Us spokesman Jason Vanderground told CNA. 
Those evangelical Christian Super Bowl ads — and the backlash to them — explained.  Many of those who represent Jesus have made people in the LGBTQ+ community feel judged and excluded. And  
The NFL gives teams $4,000 for each Super Bowl ring, and team owners spend their own money to improve them. The rings Chicago Bears players received from the McCaskey family for Super Bowl XX cost $4,000. 
During Super Bowl Sunday, a 60-second ad aired about Jesus Christ, and no one seemed angrier about it than Christians. The ad depicts a series of images of one person washing another person’s feet. 
ADWEEK's Super Bowl 59 Ad Tracker monitors all the advertisers in this year's Big Game. ADWEEK; NFL 
211 votes, 496 comments. true. nobody questions the money raised for an ad until it’s one about Jesus.
