        <p>Find out the 2025 NFL Super Bowl prize money, winner payout, and bonus money. The 2025 NFL Super Bowl promises to come with a mouthwatering prize money for winners, even as players who become the NFL champions would take home an eye-watering sum of money. The 2025 Super Bowl LIX is expected to be a cracker with the final event on our hands already. 
How much money will the Super Bowl winners and losers get? The most recent collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and the NFL was struck in 2020. It states that each member of the winning team will receive $171,000 for winning the 2025 Super Bowl. 
Dating back to Super Bowl I, the payouts for winning and playing in the game appear, at first glance, to have changed dramatically. Back in the first Super Bowl, the winner was paid $15,000, and the loser $7,500. However, when adjusted for inflation, that equates to roughly $117,000 and $59,000 in 2022. 
How Much Do Players Get Paid For Winning The Super Bowl? Each player on the winning side of Super Bowl LIV will take home $171,000, according to Article 37 in the NFL collective bargaining agreement. This is $7,000 more per player than last year, where eligible players from the winning team each received $164,000. 
The 2025 Super Bowl champion will receive a prize of $171,000 per player, reflecting a $7,000 increase from last year. This amount is part of the latest collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and the players' union. As the regular season nears its end, several teams are emerging as favorites. 
The Super Bowl is worth $171,000 for each player on the winning team and $96,000 for the one that comes up short.  (+600) have the fourth-best odds to win the Super Bowl-the Lions (+295) are  
Winners of Super Bowl 2025 will get $171,000 each and a Super Bowl ring. These rings celebrate the players’ hard work and skill. Jostens, the top choice for making these rings, has made 38 out of 58 so far. Each ring costs between $30,000 and $50,000. The NFL covers the cost of the first 150 rings for the champions.
