Per Polymarket odds, Super Bowl LIX’s viewership is favored to land between 115 million and 120 million (+355). 120 million to 125 million (+376) is not out of the question, either.

NFL recorded an international viewership of 62.5 million in 2023 for the Super Bowl. This figure excluded the domestic viewership of 123.4 million viewers in the United States. Of the recorded international viewers in 2023, 24.1 million viewers were from Mexico, the highest viewership recorded since the game began and a 5% increase compared to  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers.
