        <p>The Lions are one of 12 NFL teams that do not have any Super Bowl wins in franchise history. Yet while Detroit does not have a Super Bowl to its name, the franchise has won an NFL championship. 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. The closest they came to winning a Super Bowl was in 1991 and 2023 when they lost the Conference Championship. Detroit Lions Pages 
In the Super Bowl era, the Lions have made three appearances in the NFC Championship Game: the 1991 season (lost to Washington) and the 2023 season (lost to San Fransisco). What Is the Lions’ Super Bowl Record? The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. 
A Brief History of the Detroit Lions’ Super Bowl Journey. The Detroit Lions started in 1930. They were successful in the 1930s and 1950s. But, their Super Bowl history is different, filled with challenges and missed chances. The Rise of the Lions: 1930s to 1950s. The Lions won their first World Championship in 1935 against the New York Giants. 
Detroit Lions’ Lack of Playoff Success. The Lions have won four NFL championships in their history but only three playoff wins in the Super Bowl era (1966).. The Lions’ first playoff appearance in the Super Bowl era was a 5-0 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in 1970. 
The Detroit Lions have not yet won a Super Bowl, as of December 2024. Get detailed information on Detroit Lions Super Bowl Appearances, their championships wins and much more on Sportskeeda. 
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957.

Detroit shone in the spotlight on Feb. 5, 2006 as the city played host to Super Bowl XL at Ford Field 
The Amen-Ra Drummers and Dancers are known for performing around the Detroit metro area, holding drumming and dancing lessons, and even performing as part of Super Bowl XL in Detroit in 2006. This performance is open to all ages and starts at 7 p.m. Tickets are $15 in advance or $20 at the door. 
The Super Bowl XL rings were produced by the Minneapolis-based jewelry company Jostens, which is the primary supplier of Super Bowl champion rings and has made 31 rings in the Super Bowl's 50-year history through 2017. [84] 
The Detroit Lions have made significant strides this offseason with their coaching hires, and one of the most important decisions came when they promoted Kelvin Sheppard to defensive coordinator. Now, a Super Bowl-winning coach has weighed in on the move, and his endorsement couldn't be stronger. Steve Spagnuolo's Strong Endorsement 
Dan Campbell, the head coach of the Detroit Lions. The Lions have had 30 head coaches throughout their franchise history. Their first head coach was Hal Griffen, who compiled a 5–6–3 (.464) overall record with the team of 1930. Wayne Fontes was the longest-tenured head coach in Lions history, serving from 1988 to 1996.

This day in sports history: Pittsburgh Steelers win 'one for the thumb' at Super Bowl XL. Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Seattle Seahawks 10 (Feb. 5, 2006; Ford Field, Detroit) 
The Lions will hold on to win 30-27, securing their first Super Bowl victory in franchise history. Detroit will finally have its moment, with Dan Campbell’s culture, leadership, and the team’s incredible growth taking them to the pinnacle of the NFL. 
However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships, with the last coming in 1957. They are one of 14 teams in NFL history to have won four or more NFL Championships. NFL Championship Wins
