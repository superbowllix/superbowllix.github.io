        <p>There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The Steelers won four titles in six seasons and are the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls on multiple occasions. Pittsburgh's six Super Bowl victories are tied for the NFL record. Miami  
Who was the last back-to-back Super Bowl champion? No team has won back-to-back Super Bowls since the 2003 and '04 Patriots. New England won three championships in Tom Brady's first four seasons  
Kansas City won its first Super Bowl in 1970 and didn't win again until 2020. The Chiefs have now won back-to-back Super Bowls, bringing them to four in franchise history. × 
Super Bowl Appearances: 2022 - Super Bowl LVII, defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35. 2023 - Super Bowl LVIII, defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 (overtime) 2024 - Super Bowl LIX, play the Philadelphia Eagles.

At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
Winning a Super Bowl is hard. Winning two in a row is magical. Here's all the NFL teams that have won the biggest football game of the season back-to-back.  This powerful roster took the  
The Miami Dolphins made history in 1972 when they completed the NFL’s only undefeated season with a Super Bowl VII win against Washington. A perfect season wasn’t enough, though, as they went  
The last time a team repeated as Super Bowl champions was in 2004 and 2005.  I’m sure there’s a little motivation to prevent the ‘Hawks from going two-in-a-row. Through 48 Super Bowls, it  
The Green Bay Packers previously won three championships in a row from 1965-67, but the first was an NFL championship before they won the first two AFL-NFL world championships. 
There has never been a team that won three straight titles in the Super Bowl era. Several teams won three or more consecutive NFL Championships, but those took place before the Packers and Chiefs squared off in January 1967. The Patriots won three rings in four years from 2001-04 (with the final championship game played in February 2005). 
Kansas City didn't make another Super Bowl for 50 years, then made two in a row. They won Super Bowl 54 against the 49ers in 2020, then lost in Super Bowl 55 to Tom Brady and the Buccaneers in  
The Miami Dolphins were the first team to reach three straight Super Bowls. Miami was the runner-up in the 1971 season before winning two straight Super Bowls. The New England Patriots had been  
Now they have a chance to make it three in a row in Super Bowl 59.It would be the first time any NFL team has won back-to-back-to-back Super Bowls. Kansas City has made it to the conference  
The Steelers won the Super Bowl twice in a row in the 1978-1979 seasons, and twice in a row in the 1974-1975 seasons. All National Football League Teams Arizona Cardinals 
The Green Bay Packers came closest, winning three consecutive NFL championships in 1965, 1966, and 1967, but the first title came before the Super Bowl era. In the Super Bowl era, several teams  
The Kansas City Chiefs last won the Super Bowl in the 2023 season.  twice in a row in the 2022-2023 seasons. All National Football League Teams  
Earl Morrall won 3 times in Super Bowls in his career. 
The New England Patriots [2] hold the record for most consecutive playoff games won, with ten postseason wins in a row from 2001–2005 including three Super Bowl wins. The Patriots also hold the longest playoff appearance streak, with 11 consecutive appearances from 2009 to 2019. 
The Dallas Cowboys last won the Super Bowl in the 1995 season.  twice in a row in the 1992-1993 seasons. All National Football League Teams  </p>
