Taking out two pushes and one pick ’em game, favorites are 28-27 (51%) in the game against the spread.

The Chiefs advanced to their third straight Super Bowl with a cover as 1-point home favorites in a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game Sunday as the Over (49) hit. QB Patrick Mahomes was 18-of-26 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD, while adding 2 more TDs on the ground as he rushed for 43 yards on 11 carries.

We're looking at the 2025 Super Bowl Over/Under odds for the Feb. 9, NFL championship matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles.  The Super Bowl spread odds still show the Chiefs as the 1.5-point
