        <p>The modern communal pop extravaganza known as the Super Bowl halftime show can trace its roots to Jan. 31, 1993, when Michael Jackson took the stage at the Rose Bowl for Super Bowl XXVII, where the Dallas Cowboys would trample the Buffalo Bills, 52-17. 
The NFC won 13 straight Super Bowls from 19 thru 31. 2 of them, 49ers over the Bengals and Giants over the Bills, went down to the wire, a couple other were competitive, but most of the games were not competitive. They were bor 
Michael Jackson's performance changed the entire idea of the super bowl halftime shows, he made them start to mean something, they went from record low ratings at halftime, to his performance having more people watching than the actual game 
Michael Jackson's 1993 Super Bowl performance: The show that changed everything. After Jackson's performance, dogs self-rocketed to the moon and danced the rhumba. Eyes bled orange juice that dripped upwards into a giant golden chalice in the sky, and rivers burped up shoulderless arms that scrabbled across vast plains of scrambled eggs. 
Imagine trying to give early 90s Michael Jackson time cues lmao. At that point in time, that man could do whatever he wanted with his performance, and absolutely nobody could say shit to him. He probably stood still for longer just because they were trying to give him time cues 
The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show took place on January 31, 1993, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, as part of Super Bowl XXVII. In an effort to increase its profile after being counterprogrammed by an In Living Color special the previous year, the show featured a performance by Michael Jackson. The performance was successful in its

MASTER entertainer Michael Jackson was a "nervous wreck" before his record-breaking Super Bowl performance 30 years ago - which was watched by billions, The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal. MJ was worried about how the crowd, mostly made up of NFL fans, would react to his pop-hit medley.

I vaguely remember that Super Bowl but unfortunately I don‚Äôt remember the halftime show. I do however have memories of watching Free Willy on VHS in late 1993/early 1994, and loving the Will You Be There music video at the beginning üòÇ I wish I could‚Äôve remembered Michael before all the stupid idiots tried canceling him.

Super Bowl halftimes are 1 minute longer than normal halftimes for programming convenience. The Jackson crew was only made aware of this 2 hours before showtime. The Dancer Guild refused to dance for more than their contract stated. Even MJ, as a member of the guild, couldn't dance during that time or he would risk expulsion. 
Miles Teller talks about how he decided to join the cast of the Michael Jackson biopic: ‚ÄúBefore I choose a role, I consider everything. Regardless of opinion, Michael is one of the best, if not the best. He deserves to be made into a movie. It‚Äôs exciting to be a part of this.‚Äù 
MJ impersonators. I can‚Äôt remember the BAD tour magic. But I remember Dangerous one for the start of Beat it. My theory was this: while he‚Äôs in the chair he goes down in the stage and there must be a passage tunnel that leads to the cherry picker and has tear off clothing and only has to put on the beat it jacket hops on the cherry picker and away he goes.
