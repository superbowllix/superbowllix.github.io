        <p>Seattle hung 43 points on Denver in Super Bowl 48, and Wilson was a big reason for it, being one of four quarterbacks to ever produce an elite passing grade in the Super Bowl. Wilson was especially effective in a clean pocket, improving his grade to 92.4 while completing 17 of 22 attempts for 199 yards with three big-time throws.

Super Bowl 59 is set, and it's time to break down the matchup from every angle. From team metrics and quarterback comparisons to highest-graded players, we dive into the numbers that will define this year’s championship game. Here's everything you need to know about Super Bowl 59, backed by PFF's data-driven insights. 
25. Terry Bradshaw, Super Bowl XIV (Steelers 31, Rams 19) 14 of 21 fo 309 yards, 2 TD, 3 INT; The only quarterback to win MVP honors with three interceptions. 
While Montana and Brady have most of the Super Bowl's passing records, Aikman holds the record for the Super Bowl's highest career completion percentage with at least 50 pass attempts (70 percent). 4. 
Super Bowl III: New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7. Passer rating: 9.3. Passing stats: 6-for-17, 71 yards, 0 TD/3 INT. In the first game to be officially dubbed “Super Bowl” — the first two iterations were known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game and retroactively renamed — Morrall and the Colts went down to Joe Namath and the Jets in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history.

Matched up against Dan Marino, Montana had 400 total yards and four total touchdowns (he also ran for a then-Super Bowl QB record 59 rushing yards) in the 49ers' blowout win over the Dolphins in  
Here are the 10 highest rushing yard outputs in Super Bowl history by a quarterback: Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl LVII: 70 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs, Super Bowl LVIII: 66 
That game did not earn a spot among the top 25 performances from a quarterback in the Super Bowl, but Brady did top this list with four appearances. Three quarterbacks—Brady, Montana and Kurt  
The better QB that day lol, Foles played amazing and that was the best Super Bowl of my lifetime but Brady is potentially the greatest QB of all time and I don’t even like him. Reply reply More replies 
QB Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles PFF Grade: 92.2. Hurts recorded five big-time throws, which tied for the second-most in a Super Bowl over the past 22 years. He went 27-of-38 for 304 yards and produced a 92.9 PFF passing grade. 
That's the case for Foles, as PFF shows him having a 92.3 overall grade with a 90.7 passing grade. But it's not the case for Rodgers, PFF shows Rodgers with a 91.6 overall grade and a 91.7 passing grade for the SB.

The Chiefs came out on top, winning by a field goal in the final seconds. If he sees the same game it is going to be a fun one to watch. PFF graded the top Chiefs players playing in Super Bowl LIX. 2.

Completions: 22 for 25, 268 yards, three touchdowns Quarterback rating: 150.9. Simms’ performance against the Broncos was the single-most efficient game in Super Bowl history. </p>
