        <h2><strong>super bowl mvp from ohio state new super bowl records</strong></h2>
        <p>Holmes' valiant effort made him the first and only Ohio player to get Super Bowl MVP recognition till date. The 2008 season saw Holmes haul in 55 passes for 821 yards and five touchdowns. 
A look at where every Super Bowl MVP went to college and which college has the most MVP's.  Penn State: X: Lynn Swann:  Ohio State: XLIV: Drew Brees: New Orleans Saints: Quarterback: 
He was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round of the 2006 NFL draft after playing college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes. In 2009, Holmes was named the most valuable player (MVP) of Super Bowl XLIII as the Steelers beat the Arizona Cardinals. In 2010, Holmes was traded to the New York Jets in exchange for the Jets' fifth  
Some surprising schools on the list are represented by the 58 Super Bowl MVP winners. Whether you view that in the negative or positive light, it can be eye-opening. Perhaps that is due to the recency bias of Michigan being at the top. Some national powers on this list don't have a Super Bowl MVP that might surprise you such as Auburn, LSU, or  
With the heroic performance, Holmes became the first (and only) Ohio State player to earn Super Bowl MVP honors. Buckeyes everywhere As first-time participants in the Super Bowl, Eli Apple, Vonn  
Another Heisman winner out of Ohio State to play in the Super Bowl was running back Eddie George.  Santonio Holmes played in Super Bowl XLIII and won the MVP award for the winners,90 Pittsburgh  
Holmes is the only former Buckeye to win Super Bowl MVP, earning him the best performance by a Buckeye in Super Bowl history. Against the Arizona Cardinals, Holmes caught nine passes for 131 yards. 
That catch capped a nine-reception, 131-yard performance, earning him the honor of being the Super Bowl XLIII MVP. The Steelers took home the title in a 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. 
Mahomes enters Super Bowl 59 tied with Joe Montana for the second-most Super Bowl MVPs at three apiece. The only other players to win the award multiple times are Terry Bradshaw (2), Eli Manning  
Only 10 defensive players have been named Super Bowl MVP, the last being Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller for his stellar performance in Super Bowl 50. And also more often than not,  
Ohio State has had 59 alums play in a Super Bowl throughout the years, but only one of them was ever named the game's MVP. That honor goes to Santonio Holmes. 
Super Bowl MVP Odds: Who Are The Favorites &amp; Long Shots? (odds provided by DraftKings) The Quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes (+120) Jalen Hurts (+350) Patrick Mahomes is obviously the odds-on favorite to take home the award. The quarterback of the winning team has been named the MVP in well over half of all Super Bowls, and the Chiefs are favored in  
Tyler Forness: (Editor's note: Forness picked the Chiefs to win in our predictions post) The Super Bowl MVP has gone to a player on the winning team in every instance but one: Super Bowl V when Dallas Cowboys LB Chuck Howley won the award in a 16-13 loss to the Baltimore Colts. This could be the second instance, as Saquon Barkley is the engine  
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - FEBRUARY 12: Quarterback Patrick Mahomes #15 of the Kansas City Chiefs poses with the MVP award during a news conference for the winning head coach and MVP of Super Bowl LVIII  
He became the first and only Ohio State player to snag the prestigious Super Bowl MVP award. Talk about a feather in the cap (or a buckeye in the helmet, if you will). Fun Fact: Holmes' touchdown catch was so acrobatic, it defied the laws of physics and possibly good taste in celebratory dances (sorry, Santonio, we still love you! 
GLENDALE, ARIZONA – FEBRUARY 12: NFL referee Carl Cheffers does the coin toss before Super Bowl LVII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at State Farm Stadium on February  
The Super Bowl isn’t just about football—it’s about food! Whether you’re a die-hard fan or just here for the snacks, one thing’s for sure: game-day eats are just as important as the touchdowns. From gooey cheese dips to sizzling wings, every state has its own MVP when it comes to Super Bowl favorites. 
Before the New England Patriots became well — the New England Patriots, the team appeared in the Super Bowl against the Green Bay Packers. Former Ohio State Heisman runner-up Keith Byars totaled 42 yards and a touchdown on four receptions, as he was used mostly in the passing game. Brett Favre and the Packers went on to win 35-21. 
The spread for Super Bowl 59 is identical at each of the best Ohio sportsbooks. The Chiefs are a 1.5-point favorite, and 53% of the wagers at BetMGM are backing Kansas City. 
Santonio Holmes, Super Bowl XLIII. Nobody in Ohio State history — and possibly Super Bowl history — has a more iconic Super Bowl moment than Santonio Holmes. The former Buckeyes star receiver caught seven passes for 131 yards and a touchdown from Ben Roethlisberger in the Steelers 27-23 win over the Arizona Cardinals. </p>
