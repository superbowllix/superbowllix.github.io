        <p>Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda. Typically, that's the response you get when you talk about what could've been. But when it comes to these 20 Super Bowl matchups, there's no question they should've happened. 
While we've had some great Super Bowl matchups from the past 50 years there are plenty of "what-if" Super Bowls that could have been incredibly epic. For Super Bowl historians, here are what I think are 10 great Super Bowls that never happened in no particular order. 1. 49ers vs. Chargers, 1981 
The Super Bowl is one of the greatest sporting events in NFL history. It matches the best NFL teams up against one another in a game viewed by millions each year 
Not good enough to be the greatest Super Bowl matchup that never happened, though. Below are the top 10 dream Super Bowls the world missed out on, based on a variety of factors -- I looked at top  
The Jets' most recent championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002  
Super Bowl matchups by year. Super Bowl 1: Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10; Super Bowl 2: Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14; Super Bowl 3: New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7 
Super Bowl Top 10 Super Bowls that never were. While there have been many classic Super Bowls, we have been robbed of what could have been some special match-ups once the two-team wildcard era was  
Elliot Harrison looks back at the 10 greatest Super Bowls in NFL history that never happened. NFL Throwback takes a look at the longest play that the Pittsburgh Steelers have had in a "Monday  
Overall, there have been 12 Super Bowl matchups between two teams never to win one, starting of course with Super Bowl I, in which the Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 35-10.. The

I know this chart only says “Super Bowl era”, but the only playoff matches the Cardinals had pre-1970 were 2 games against the Eagles and 1 against the Packers. It’s absolutely insane how irrelevant the Cardinals have been outside of 2008 and 2015. 
I came in here excepting to see like historical Super Bowl match ups that everyone wanted too see but never got the chance too. Instead I got Bucs vs Steelers, Browns vs Vikings and something called the bird bowl featuring two NFC teams. What the fuck man. 
8. Buffalo Bills vs. Los Angeles Rams. We have two games remaining that involve the Rams, and they will slot in at Nos. 7 and 8. I give them a bump over the Commanders in large part because they  
And they've never played each other in the Super Bowl. While this matchup almost happened several times, the stars didn't align.  Two brand-new expansion teams have never played a Super Bowl  
The two squared off in a Super Bowl once before, 17 years ago in Super Bowl 36. The only player from either team who will play in both the 2002 and 2019 games is a certain Patriots quarterback.

Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda. Typically, that's the response you get when you talk about what could've been. But when it comes to these 20 Super Bowl matchups, there's no question they should've happened. 
With the NFL playoffs well underway and the AFC and NFC Championship Games mere days away, fans are more intrigued than ever to find out which two franchises will battle on the ultimate stage for  </p>
