        <p>No, a Super Bowl has never been postponed or delayed due to weather. The only Super Bowl delay in history was the 34-minute stoppage caused by the Superdome power outage during Super Bowl 52 in 2013. 
The 2014 Super Bowl XLVIII was the only one held in a “cold weather” city without a domed stadium. That Super Bowl was held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on February 2, 2014, and, although the weather was mild for that location with a game-time temperature of 49°F, 8 inches of snow fell the very next day. 
Still, in NFL Super Bowl history, no game has ever been delayed due to weather. Super Bowl XLVII in 2014 was the first and so far, the only game to be delayed. The Ravens-49ers game was delayed for 34 minutes in the third quarter thanks to an electrical mishap. But that doesn't mean weather hasn't tried to stop the Super Bowl.

THE WARMEST. Now to some warmer temperatures. A year after the coldest Super Bowl on record was the warmest. Super Bowl VII in 1973 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum recorded 84 degrees at kickoff. 
As a result, Super Bowl VI was played outdoors at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans on Jan. 16, 1972. The high temperature for the day only reached 43 degrees, far below the average January high of 62.
