Super Bowl Sunday is the day on which the Super Bowl, the National Football League (NFL)'s annual championship game, is played. It was the first Sunday in February from Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 until Super Bowl LV in 2021, but is now the second Sunday, beginning with Super Bowl LVI . 
As the Super Bowl usually lasts for 3 hours and 30 minutes on average, a Super Bowl starting at 6:30 p.m. ET will end between 10:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Q. How many Super Bowls have taken place? 
The first Super Bowl in Las Vegas, this was a rematch of Super Bowl LIV between the 49ers and the Chiefs, and was the Chiefs' fourth Super Bowl appearance in five years. The second Super Bowl to go into overtime, the Chiefs came back from another 10-point deficit to win their third Super Bowl in five years and secure back-to-back championships  
What time does the Super Bowl start? The Super Bowl will take place on February 11. Kick-off is set for 6:30 PM EST. This is the same time that it kicks off every single year. 
Here's what day the Super Bowl falls on in 2025, where the Super Bowl 2025 is taking place, and more. What day is the Super Bowl 2025? As we all know, the Super Bowl happens on a Sunday every year, despite the inevitable Monday morning football hangover. This year, the Super Bowl will take place on Sunday, February 9, 2025. 
This year marks the eighth time that the Super Bowl has been played at the Superdome. Kickoff will be on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, at 5:30 p.m. CT local time (6:30 p.m. ET, 3:30 p.m. PT). 
The Super Bowl has topped television ratings in the United States every year since the first championship game in 1967. This has made commercial time during its broadcast the most expensive of any televised event in the United States. In 2016, for example, a 30-second spot cost approximately $4.8 million. 
Jay-Z-founded entertainment company Roc Nation, along with the NFL and Apple Music, announced Lamar would be this year's Super Bowl halftime show performer on Sunday, Sept. 8, 2024, the same day  
As a pats fan, the first 3 super bowl jerseys where cool to collect with the unique post card esque patches, the last 3 where almost identical. So less jersey sales too. It also removes the nostalgia of different eras with the corporate washing of the super bowl logo. 
Last year's Daytona 500 got 8.9 million viewers, but last year's Super Bowl got 99.18 million viewers and it was lower than every single Super Bowl in the 2010s. Reply reply More replies 
How did the Super Bowl logo change from 2010 to 2020? For five straight years, the Super Bowl logo had the same formula: the Lombardi Trophy and stadium sitting atop “Super Bowl” and the Roman  
With Super Bowl ticket prices routinely hitting $1,000+ today, it might be a bit shocking to know that Super Bowl I failed to sell out, with more than 30,000 empty seats at kickoff. 
A report from the National Retail Federation last year found that the Super Bowl generates around $17.3 billion, with the average American spending around $85 on Super Bowl-rated purchases in 2024

Miami Dolphins, 40 years – Lost Super Bowl XIX, 1984 season; Washington Commanders, 33 years – Won Super Bowl XXVI, 1991 season (played as Washington Redskins) Buffalo Bills, 31 years – Lost Super Bowl XXVIII, 1993 season; Los Angeles Chargers, 30 years – Lost Super Bowl XXIX, 1994 season (played as San Diego Chargers) 
For example, the cheapest ticket for last year's 49ers vs Chiefs game in the nosebleeds averaged around $7,800. As for this year? It'll cost you less than $4,000 to get into the Caesars Superdome, but you may want to wait - with every passing day the price gets lower and lower. So why the big drop in Super Bowl prices? 
Either switch days or places should make it a 3 day weekend. I heard on the radio studies show the Monday after the Super Bowl is the most unproductive day of the year Why not switch out a three day weekend for something lame like Presidents’ Day?
