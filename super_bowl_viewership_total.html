        <p>In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people.

The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers.

That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014.

The most-watched Super Bowl of all time came in 2024. Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles had more than 123.7 million total average viewers. Streaming numbers from Paramount+ were added to the viewership numbers, which helped push the game past 123 million. 
Mexico: Total audience reach of 24.1 million, with an average of 8.7 million viewers, up +5% year-on-year and the highest since records began.  In addition to viewership of Super Bowl LVIII

NEW YORK – February 14, 2023 –An estimated 113.06 million viewers were tuned in for Super Bowl LVII on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The Super Bowl LVII telecast ran from 6:44 PM ET to 10:14 PM ET and averaged nearly 112.2 million viewers on FOX.
