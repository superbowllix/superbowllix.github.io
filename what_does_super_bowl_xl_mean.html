And for that last bit: The league retroactively added Roman numerals to the first, second, third and fourth Super Bowls. Super Bowl V was the first modern-era NFL championship game between the  
Super Bowl V was the first such game to use Roman numerals — a system the NFL put into place to avoid confusion, as a Super Bowl is played in a calendar year following a listed season. 
The number 40, for example, is XL, to symbolize 10 before 50. Therefore, 44 would be XLIV. The number 90 would be XC, meaning 99 would be represented as XCIX.  Why does the Super Bowl use Roman  
SUPER BOWL PREDICTIONS: How the 2025 Super Bowl could go terribly wrong for Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. Here’s the lesson: each number is a symbol: I is 1. V is 5. X is 10. L is 50. 
Why does the Super Bowl use Roman numerals? Here is the explanation from the NFL's media guide:  "When we developed the Super Bowl XL logo, that was the first time we looked at the letter L  
The Roman numerals XL means 40. L is 50 and X is 10 but since the X is before the L it means 10 less than 50.  What does superbowl XL mean? Updated: 10/24/2023. Wiki User. ∙ 11y ago. Study

Super Bowl XL was an American football game in the National Football League between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Pittsburgh Steelers against the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Seattle Seahawks to decide the Super Bowl champion for the 2005 season. It was played on February 5, 2006. 
Host selection process Looking toward the stadium on the night of the Super Bowl. Ford Field was selected to host Super Bowl XL on November 1, 2000, at the owners meetings held in Atlanta, two years before the stadium opened in 2002; [7] the only previous Super Bowl held in the Detroit area, Super Bowl XVI, had been played at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1982 (also between teams from the AFC
