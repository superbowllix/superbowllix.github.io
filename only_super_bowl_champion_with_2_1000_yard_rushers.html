        <p>Jackson broke Vick's single season record for most rushing yards by a quarterback [10] as well as Dunn's record for the most rushing yards of a member of a 1,000-yard rushing duo. The 1978 Chicago Bears came the closest to having a 1000-yard duo without succeeding, when Walter Payton finished with 1,305 yards but Roland Harper fell 8 yards  
The rushing game isn't what it used to be in the NFL. Short passes have taken over where running backs used to have to plow through the trenches to gain critical yards. Who are the running backs who have rushed for 1,000 yards in the regular season on teams that won the Super Bowl since the 2000 regular season? 
The NFL Immaculate Grid has given fans one of the tougher connections to make among players. It asked about Super Bowl champions who've had a 1,000-yard rushing season in their career. 
Most Rushing Yards in Super Bowl History Only one player has rushed for over 200 yards in a Super Bowl—Washington's Timmy Smith, who gained 204 yards on 22 carries in a blowout win over the  
Super Bowl championships Game Date/ Season Winning team Score Losing team Venue City Attendance Referee Ref. I [sb 1]January 15, 1967 (1966 AFL/1966 NFL) : Green Bay Packers n (1, 1–0) 
The Hall of Fame running back had just 40 rushing yards in the Dolphins' 24-3 loss to Dallas at Super Bowl VI, but helped Miami finish off a perfect 1972 with 112 yards in a 14-7 Super Bowl win  
Barkley, who turns 28 on Super Bowl Sunday, has been a menace in the playoffs — with TD runs of 62, 78 and 60 yards — but now runs up against a Chiefs defense that did not allow any player to  
Super Bowl Champion (1985)  while also catching 63 passes for 477 yards and 4 touchdowns, becoming only the second rookie in NFL history to achieve over 1,200 rushing yards and 60 receptions  
A consensus All-American at Syracuse and the Dolphins’ No.1 draft pick in 1968, Csonka contributed almost picture-perfect performances in Miami's three Super Bowl seasons in 1971, 1972 and 1973. He surpassed 1,000 yards in rushing all three seasons with his best production – 1,117 yards – coming during Miami's perfect season in 1972. 
Both the 1972 Dolphins and 1976 Steelers played 14-game regular season schedules, while the 1985 Browns, 2006 Falcons, 2008 Giants, 2009 Panthers, and 2019 Ravens played 16-game regular season schedules. And only the 1972 Dolphins were able to parlay their rushing success into a Super Bowl championship. 
12 of the last 15 Super Bowl winning teams won without a 1,000 yard rusher. This is the SB winning team and their leading rusher that season. 2022 Chiefs - Isiah Pacheco with 830 yards

Let’s take a look at the New England Patriots 1000-yard rushers in their history as the team seems ready to adopt a ground-and-pound offense. An article not too long ago by sister site Musket  
3000 yards is a lot when you are running that much. Can’t imagine there are too many. Nebraska only has 4 seasons where a QB even threw for 3000 yards. Only 9 for 2500 yards. Though Nebraska’s passing and receiving records are trash as they are usually more run dominant. Taylor Martinez went 2871 passing /1019 rushing in 2012 which is the  
Csonka, the Hall of Fame fullback, led the Dolphins in rushing with 1,117 yards on 213 carries and scored 6 TDs. Meanwhile, Morris rushed for an even 1,000 yards and scored a then-club record 12 touchdowns. By doing so, Csonka and Morris became the first set of runners from the same team to rush for 1,000 yards in the same season. 
That means Blount, on the ’16 Patriots, is the last such player to rush for 1,000 yards and win the Super Bowl in the same season. In fact, just 3 of the last 13 Super Bowl champions (including whoever wins Super Bowl LV) had 1,000 yard rushers: Ray Rice on the 2012 Ravens, Marshawn Lynch on the ’13 Seahawks, and Blount on the ’16 Patriots. 
Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier each hit the K-mark for the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers in 1976, and Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack each ran for 1,000 yards for Cleveland in 1985. George  
The Falcons put a different spin on the milestone in 2006. There were a pair of backs over 1,000 yards, but one was a quarterback. Michael Vick (1,039 yards) joined Warrick Dunn (1,140). The duo only found the end zone on rushing plays six times. 
The oldest team in the NFL has never won a Super Bowl and only been there once. They have 2 pre-Super Bowl Championships, but one is protested by historians. They had a 51-year playoff win drought. Yet they aren't even usually mentioned among "most cursed franchises".
