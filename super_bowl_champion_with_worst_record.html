        <h2><strong>super bowl champion with worst record who played in the super bowl in 2025 halftime show</strong></h2>
        <p>Yes, this has happened 5 times in history. The 1998 St. Louis Rams (4-12), 2000 New England Patriots (5-11), 1980 San Francisco 49ers (6-10), 2019 Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9) and 2016 Philadelphia Eagles (7-9) all won the Super Bowl the next season after having a losing record. 
So the Patriots had the single worst record, either alone or tied with other teams, of any Super Bowl champion through X games, for all values of X from 1 to 11. At 6-5, the 2011 Giants were tied with the Patriots (and ’88 49ers) for worst record, and the 2011 Giants hold the mark for worst record of any Super Bowl champion through X games  
The 2007 Giants, on paper, were very mediocre. They were 14th in points per game, 17th in points allowed, and had just a +22 point differential, which is the second worst for a Super Bowl-winning team in NFL history. The Giants were 10-6 in the regular season and barely squeaked into the playoffs. 
8 teams are tied for the worst record in Super Bowls, with a record of 0-1. The first three are the Arizona Cardinals, the Carolina Panthers and the Tennessee Titans.

We are talking about Super Bowl records from the game itself. Whether we are talking about Steve Young, Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Terrell Davis, Jerry Rice and Marcus Allen, just to name some, there

Except for the 1972 Dolphins, every Super Bowl champion has endured a loss. Several have needed to recover from a one-sided defeat, while many champs had a chance to avenge their worst loss in the

10. Super Bowl XLVIII. The Denver Broncos entered the Super Bowl XLVIII as a great offensive team that scored a record-breaking 606 points during the 2013 NFL regular season. 
Super Bowl History + indicates Hall of Fame; Table; Date SB AFC Pts NFC Pts MVP Stadium City State; Feb 9, 2025: LIX (59) Kansas City Chiefs: Philadelphia Eagles  
The Seattle Seahawks enter Week 11 two games out of first place in their division and holding the last NFC wild-card spot. Here are the worst finishes ever by a defending Super Bowl champion. 
The then-losingest team in history to make a Super Bowl, with no notable players beyond JPP and Manning, beat the “unstoppable” Patriots in the most-watched event in tv history at the time. It’s like training your whole life to run a race just to get beaten by the guy who discovered shoes yesterday. And it was glorious. 
The Los Angeles Rams are officially the worst-ever defending Super Bowl champion thanks to a 5-12 record in what was a disastrous 2022-23 season. Yes, season-ending injuries to Matthew Stafford  
The teams wound up with a 5-12 record, marking the worst ever season for a defending Super Bowl champion. Making matters worse, they had to ship their No. 6 draft pick to the Detroit Lions as part of the trade that netted them Stafford (and the Super Bowl LVI title). How every Super Bowl champion fared the next season 
8 teams are tied for the worst record in Super Bowls, with a record of 0-1. The first three are the Arizona Cardinals, the Carolina Panthers and the Tennessee Titans. 
This was only the second time in Super Bowl history both quarterbacks passed for at least 300 yards, and it ranked second in Super Bowl history in terms of total offensive yards produced. The 37 points in the fourth quarter were the most combined points in any quarter of a Super Bowl game, much less the decisive fourth quarter. </p>
