        <p>The 2nd tv is def worse. Normally we could have 3 tvs and an iPad w the same football game running w no issue. I did NOT upgrade to 4k bc I didn’t want to chance streaming issues. I wish our damned antenna worked. 2nd Edit: Gave up on 2nd tv stream. I’ll just grill our wings out here without it. 
Last night’s Super Bowl, won by the Chiefs in overtime, 25-22, was marred by numerous streaming glitches on multiple providers. While there were few reports of issues on traditional cable and satellite services, many fans who watched the game on a live streaming service, or Paramount Plus, complained on social media of picture freezing and  
Update 2 (February 12, 2024) 08:33 am (IST): Just about a year later, it seems YouTube TV still hasn’t managed to get a grip on its servers during the Super Bowl. Reports on X suggest that many users are facing issues with YouTube TV buffering or the video quality appearing pixelated. 
You should probably mention what you use to stream and whether you have 5.1 audio turned on or off. I have an Apple TV and have noticed lip sync issues previously and read that turning 5.1 audio off might fix my problems, but it didn't. I just turned on the coverage (and also just subscribed to YouTube TV 4K) and I think I'm seeing lip sync issues. 
Paramount+ and YouTube TV customers experienced delays mostly early on in the stream of Super Bowl LVIII. Some Fubo viewers report experiencing problems into the second half of the game. 
Update — engineering took a look at the pic of your Stats for Nerds &amp; the feed at that time, but wasn't able to see this pixelation. Since reinstalling didn't help, definitely submit in-app feedback, then reach out to the YouTube TV support team here. They'll be able to give more 1:1 troubleshooting &amp; gather any insights that can help  
Paramount Plus and other streaming services struggled during Super Bowl 2024. Here's why these issues prove cord-cutting is a problem for sports fans.  I watched via CBS on Youtube TV  
There’s a good chance that fed-up viewers will think of that platform as a better choice than an expensive live TV platform that constantly cuts out during the most important sporting events of the year, such as the Super Bowl. Until then, fans may want to look into getting an over-the-air antenna, many of which retail for $20 or less. These  
At 14:23 in quarter 1 of super bowl I get the spinning wheel "hang tight" and then video is lost. Done. — Jeremy Wojtecki (@jwojPAC) February 11, 2024 Edward Sutelan 
TAMPA, Florida – For many people, YouTube TV has become the go-to streaming service for live events such as the NFL Super Bowl. However, as the 2024 Super Bowl unfolded, some users experienced streaming issues that affected the quality of their viewing experience. Since the platform has been one of the primary ways to stream NFL games through the 2024 season, thanks in part to its exclusive  
The NFL Super Bowl is one of the biggest live TV events of the year, and with more and more folks switching from traditional cable to internet streaming, YouTube TV is the choice of many to stream  
According to a recent Phenix survey of 1,014 adults in the US who stream sports, 14 percent of respondents said they’d want to place bets live during the Super Bowl. 
No problems. But I'm getting terrible quality and constant freezes throughout the game and now halftime show. I only bought YT TV for football season, now I'm 100% dropping it after this. Especially embarrassing because I have friends over for the game. Edit: I've read all the comments, and feel like I can't blame YouTube TV at this point.

Viewers watching the NFL pre-show on Paramount+ are reporting problems with the streaming service, just hours before the 2024 Super Bowl kickoff. In some instances, the Super Bowl feed is  
Vizio, the TV maker, recommends that your Smart TV (or another Smart TV device) be positioned no more than 30 feet away from your Internet modem. Otherwise, the signal could be blocked by the walls or other obstacles in the house. Try using a TV closer to the modem, or moving the modem to the TV, if possible. 6. Get wired.

Streaming lag put Super Bowl viewers more than a minute behind what was happening in the game. Paramount Plus was the best and Fubo TV was the worst, one study found. The best Super Bowl stream  
The cost of YouTube TV got so high, I couldn't justify paying to watch the occasional sporting event. I bought a couple antennas for like 15 bucks each. Now I kick myself for having paid for streaming for so long.
