        <p>Warner became the second quarterback to start a Super Bowl with multiple teams and first since Craig Morton (Warner has since been joined by Peyton Manning and Tom Brady). [ 43 ] In Warner's third career Super Bowl appearance on February 1, the Cardinals lost Super Bowl XLIII 27–23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, leaving him with a career 1–2  
Kurt Warner's next Super Bowl appearance did not go as well as his first, as the New England Patriots knocked St. Louis off in Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002.. He was unable to follow up on his previous

That season, Warner had a very good season, and on December 16, 2008, was named the starting quarterback for the NFC team in the 2009 Pro Bowl. [42] Warner and the Cardinals won all three of their playoff games, but lost in the Super Bowl to the Pittsburgh Steelers. That makes Warner's Super Bowl record 1–2. 
Warner won the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) honor that season, and the Rams secured a place in the Super Bowl in January 2000. At the Super Bowl, Warner threw a record 414 yards and became the MVP, while his team beat the Tennessee Titans to clinch their first Super Bowl title. The same year, Warner helped the Rams reach the play-offs, but  
Warner again led the Rams to the play-offs in 2000, but the team lost in the opening round.

Their third appearance, Super Bowl IX, saw them fall to the Pittsburgh Steelers 16-6. Finally, in Super Bowl XI, they were overwhelmed by the Oakland Raiders 32-14. Despite their Super Bowl struggles, the Vikings were a powerhouse team in the 1970s, led by legendary coach Bud Grant and their fearsome “Purple People Eaters” defense. However  
With just over two minutes remaining, immediately after the #Titans tie it up after having trailed 16-0, the #Rams' NFL and Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner arcs a 73-yard touchdown strike to Isaac Bruce.
