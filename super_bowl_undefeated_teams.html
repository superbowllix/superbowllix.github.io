The Jets' most recent championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002  
The most recent time the last undefeated team won the Super Bowl was the 2006 Indianapolis Colts, who started the season 9-0, finished the season 12-4, and then went on to win the Super Bowl. On average, how many wins does the last NFL undefeated team have? 
The Baltimore Ravens are one of the undefeated teams in the Super Bowl. They played their first Super Bowl in franchise history against the New York Giants in 2001. The Ravens went on to win the

Here is the full list with the final undefeated team in each season during the Super Bowl era (some seasons had multiple teams), the teams’ final records and their end results: 1966 St. Louis Cardinals: Started 5-0-1, finished 8-5-1, missed playoffs 
What Was the Last Remaining Undefeated NFL Team To Win a Super Bowl? The last team to be the final club standing without a loss in the regular season and go on to win the Super Bowl was the Indianapolis Colts, who won nine straight contests to open the 2006 season before falling to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 14-21. 
A member of the undefeated 1972 Dolphins Super Bowl team and decorated college wide receiver has died at age 81. Howard Twilley, who caught a 28-yard touchdown pass in Miami’s 14-7 victory over

The 1972 Dolphins consisted mostly of the same core of players that it possessed from 1970 through 1974 and was the most dominant NFL team during that stretch. In those five seasons, the Dolphins reached the playoffs all five years, won three AFC Championships, two Super Bowls and went undefeated and untied while winning the Super Bowl in 1972.
