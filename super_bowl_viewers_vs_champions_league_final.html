        <h2><strong>super bowl viewers vs champions league final super bowl lviii free live stream</strong></h2>
        <p>The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to 
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global 
However, the 2024 Champions League final viewership is more than double that of Super Bowl 58. It is estimated that 450 million people watched the game between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, which ended in a 2-0 victory for Real Madrid for their 15 th Champions League win! 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football 
This figure beats every other sporting event: the '24 NBA Finals averaged 12 million, the '23 UEFA Champions League final attracted 450 million viewers, and the '24 Super Bowl had 173 million (123 million in the United States). 
On the other hand, The 2021 Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals pulled in an estimated 112 million viewers, almost 600 million fewer than the 2021 Champions League final. 
On average, the Champions League final attracts at least 400 million viewers worldwide. In 2021, the Champions League final surpassed even that with 700 million viewers. That number even topped the previous World Cup Final in 2018 between France and Croatia, which had a mere 517 global viewers. 
While the Super Bowl concentrates its biggest impact within the United States, with domestic audiences often exceeding 100 million, the Champions League final records global figures that vastly surpass this mark. 
However, there’s another annual sporting event that competes with the Champions League Final in terms of popularity and revenue: the US’s Super Bowl Sunday, which concludes the NFL season. Back in 2015, the Super Bowl brought in 114 million viewers compared to the Champions League Final’s 380 million, according to Infographics. 
Real Madrid won a record 15th Champions League title by beating Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in the final in June – Maciej Rogowski / SOPA Images/Sipa USA – Photo by Icon Sport. When it comes to a global audience, the Champions League final’s reach dwarfs that of the Super Bowl. 
Its like the World Cup for Americans essentially, ton of casual viewers who just want to be involved in the festivities. Champions League is nothing like this, there is no commercials or halftime show hoopla, very few women watch and Champions League Final parties with children and wifes making themed snacks aren't common. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
Both the Super Bowl and the Champions League final occur annually and both pit professional organizations against each other, rather than national teams. But yet again, the comparison ends with  
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
Combined Twitter Following: 25.5M (Champions League) vs. 2.22M (Super Bowl) Champions League has over 10x the number of Twitter followers but only third of the total tweets. According to my quick math, Super Bowl viewers are tweeting 38 times more per Twitter follower compared to Champions League viewers.

UEFA Champions League Final vs. Super Bowl by vocativ2 - Infogram 
The Bowl is the final game of the NFL season and is held in February. The 2021 Super Bowl won by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a viewership of 110 million viewers while the 2021 UEFA Champions League final won by Chelsea had a viewership of 700 million viewers. The numbers are obvious, the UEFA Champions League is bigger than the Super Bowl. </p>
