        <h2><strong>super bowl wins who has the most super bowl 58 zuschauerzahlen</strong></h2>
        <p>At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl.

Tom Brady has won the most Super Bowls of any player in NFL history with seven. Brady won the 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, and 2019 Super Bowls quarterbacking the New England Patriots, and the  
Pittsburgh was the first team to win three, four and six Super Bowls, winning the sixth and most recent one at the end of the 2008 season. The Steelers had a chance to win a seventh Super Bowl
