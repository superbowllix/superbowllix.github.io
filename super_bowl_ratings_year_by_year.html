        <p>Super Bowl LIV on Fox in 2020 opened up this decade amidst the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic at the time and saw significant ratings improvement from the 2 previous Super Bowl editions, but suffered lower ratings the year after, [75] with an average of 91.63 million alone on CBS - the lowest since 2006. In 2022, with the resumption of full  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Super Bowl television ratings and shares, including network (both NBC and CBS televised the first Super Bowl). The rating represents the percentage of televisions tuned in to a program. The share  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
Super Bowl. Year. Teams. Total Average Viewers. Network(s) Super Bowl LVIII. 2024.  there’s no telling how high the ratings for the Super Bowl will look like in 10 years. 
Last year, the Super Bowl received a 42.1 TV rating, which means that 42.1 percent of households tuned into the game. While that number is high, it wasn't the highest in Super Bowl history. 
The Super Bowl, the NFL’s championship game since 1967, is the most consistently watched program in the history of American television, and the most viewed TV show in any given year. Sunday’s  
Super Bowl television ratings have traditionally been high. One of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, the NFL's championship game is broadcas 
The showdown between Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes was the lowest rated Super Bowl since the days of Joe Namath 52 years ago.. Sunday’s Buccaneers-Chiefs Super Bowl 55 averaged a Nielsen-estimated 38.2 rating and 91.63 million viewers on CBS, marking the lowest rated edition of the game since Super Bowl 3 on NBC in 1969 (Jets-Colts: 36.0) and the least-watched since Super Bowl 40 on ABC in  
The 53 Super Bowls played thus far have averaged a 43.5 household rating, and there hasn’t been huge amount of variance over the years. The all-time low in households is a 36.0 for Super Bowl  
The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). Men 18-24 placed second with a 20% increase (from 3.86 to 4.61 million) and girls 12-17 third with an 11% jump (from 2.63 to 2.85 million). 
Given that this year’s Super Bowl matchup is an exact rematch of 2023, it stands to reason that Super Bowl viewership could track closely to that year’s numbers, as well. 
Nielsen also reported 202.4 million viewers had tuned in to some portion (a minimum of six minutes) of Super Bowl LVIII, a year-over-year increase of 10% (184 million). 
In the past three years, according to research by marketing professor Kim Whitler, the number of Super Bowl ads that have had male-only celebrities has declined by 26% compared with a similar  
Super Bowl XX became the first game to surpass 90 million viewers and it would take another 20 years for the NFL to break 100 million viewers, as 106.5 million tuned in to watch Drew Brees and  
In 2023, the Super Bowl NFL season recorded 600 million in ad revenue. Meanwhile, the NFL season recorded an ad revenue of 578.4 million in 2022 and 545 million in 2021. The following table displays the ad revenue recorded in the Super Bowl NFL season by year. 
The last two Super Bowl's have set audience records, averaging 123.7 million viewers last year. This season NFL regular season and postseaon ratings have dropped 
Super Bowl ratings hit the 40 mark for the first time in three years. Sunday’s Super Bowl 57 (Chiefs-Eagles) averaged a 40.0 rating and 113.06 million viewers across FOX (112.7M) and Fox Deportes (882K), marking the highest rated Super Bowl in three years (Chiefs-49ers: 41.6) and the most-watched in six (Patriots-Falcons: 113.7).*
