Watch Super Bowl LIX live on DAZN for just £0.99p. One of sport's greatest occasions is with us, Super Bowl LIX, as Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles go at it once again, in a repeat of the 2023 NFL showpiece. Watch the Super Bowl live and in full on DAZN for just £0.99p / $0.99 (check price in your country here). 
After a win in last year's Super Bowl game, Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes declared that he was "going to Disneyland." Interestingly, about a decade before, Mahomes sent out a tweet  
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. The most recent exception was in 2017, when Brady won his fourth of a record-setting five Super Bowl MVP trophies . 
The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will face off in Las Vegas on Sunday, February 11. It’s a tradition for the Super Bowl winners to then visit Disneyland or Walt Disney World. The team’s MVP usually appears in a victory parade. Last year, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes visited. 
The most recent player to participate with an “I'm Going to Disneyland” statement was MVP Patrick Mahomes after the 2024 Chiefs' Super Bowl victory. In addition to getting paid for the commercial, the MVP enjoys the celebratory parade and a VIP tour with their family the following day at either Disneyland or Disney World whichever is closest. 
Mahomes’ three Super Bowl MVP honors equal the three earned by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, who was honored after the team’s titles in 1982, 1983 and 1990. 
And why?Why Super Bowl champions go to Disneyland after the game originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia. In a tradition that dates back to 1987, the team that wins the Super Bowl gets the

Super Bowl LIV MVP Patrick Mahomes in the parade at the Magic Kingdom the day after the game "I'm going to Disney World!" and "I'm going to Disneyland!" are advertising slogans used in a series of television commercials by The Walt Disney Company that began airing in 1987. [1] 
In 1987, Phil Simms, a former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, was featured in the first Disney post-Super Bowl ad exclaiming that he planned to go to Disneyland following his team  
Super Bowl Sunday and the day after provide two very different Disneyland experiences. If you want to join in football celebrations, Super Bowl Sunday has festive energy and special merchandise. But the crowds are heavy all day. Returning the day after allows you to see the Super Bowl parade and players, but also draws peak Disneyland attendance. 
The Disneyland Super Bowl Parade featured a celebration of the winner of Super Bowl LVIII after the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs faced off. We will take you through everything you need to know about the Disneyland Super Bowl Parade, including how to watch it as well as some of the interesting history behind the famous phrase  
The winner of Super Bowl 58 will be headed toDisneyland! The post-Super Bowl celebration can be traced back to 1987 when Phil Simms uttered the famous line “I’m going to Disney World”. Simms and his family were then treated to a day at Magic Kingdom and a tradition was born. 
Making true on that post-win announcement, the three Los Angles Rams players will be at Disneyland Resort today, Monday February 14, 2022 celebrating their team’s Super Bowl LVI victory “with  
Related: How to use points to buy Disney tickets If you're ever at Disney World or Disneyland the day after the Super Bowl (again, whichever park is closer to the location of the Super Bowl is typically utilized), there's a decent chance you'll see a representative or two from the winning Super Bowl team take their place in a celebratory parade down Main Street, U.S.A., which will be held  
Traditionally, players will go to Disneyland the next day when the Super Bowl is held on the West Coast. If it is on the East Coast or the South, they travel to Walt Disney World. Patrick Mahomes at the previous Super Bowl Parade 
Since Simms became the first Super Bowl MVP to go to Disney in 1987, at least one player has uttered the line in all but one year (2005), when there was no commercial following Super Bowl XXXIX  
Manning later appeared in a Super Bowl parade at Disneyland in Anaheim May 8, 2008, more than three months after the Giants’ 17-14 upset win over the undefeated New England Patriots in Super  </p>
