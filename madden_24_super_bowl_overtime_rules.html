        <p>overtime rules for nfl postseason games Unlike regular season games, postseason games cannot end in a tie, so the overtime rules change slightly for the playoffs. * If the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended — the teams will play another overtime period. 
Yo I was playing Superstar mode in madden 24. The game was tied and we went into overtime. The CPU’s team got to receive the ball first. The CPU went on to score and boom the game was over. WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THE FUCKING NEW OVERTIME RULE DUMB FUCKING MADDEN????? U FUCKING SCREWED ME OVER SO HARD. 
So just now I was playing online against somebody &amp; after over 350 matches I finally played my first overtime game in '24. He decided to receive first &amp; scored a TD on the first drive &amp; I stopped his 2 point conversion try after the TD. The game then immediately stopped &amp; said he won. 
NFL overtime rules 2023. The NFL's overtime rules underwent a major change during the 2022 offseason when the league made a change to ensure both teams would get to possess the ball at least once during the postseason overtime period. Previously, the team to receive the ball could end the game if a touchdown was scored. 
Only two Super Bowl have ever gone to overtime. You might remember both. Somehow, the Patriots forced an extra period despite trailing the Falcons 28-3. And of course Tom Brady and New England won

Below is a look at the full overtime rules for Super Bowl 59: NFL overtime rules for the Super Bowl. Each overtime period is 15 minutes long. Overtime lasts 10 minutes in the regular season. 
The Super Bowl is here. And, with both the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs being the two best teams in the league, there’s a strong chance this game will probably be close. 
The league used those numbers — 10-2 and seven out of 12 — to justify the changes to the overtime rules. In reality, it was the breathtaking Bills-Chiefs game that forced the change. 
Just 12 games have gone to overtime since 2010, but none have yet to be played under the new OT rules that were introduced prior to the 2022 season. MORE: Watch Super Bowl 57 live with fuboTV

The league installed a modified sudden-death overtime system to help determine a winner in a tie game for the 2010 postseason. Two seasons later, the league expanded those rules to cover all NFL games. The current rules give both teams the opportunity to possess the ball at least once in overtime.

Regardless of perception in hindsight that Patriots offense was good not great at best. I think Madden's assessment of don't go for it and play for overtime isn't correct because you should take your shot but I also think he's right in his assessment that the odds of actually succeeding there are super low.
