Based on regular season winning percentage, the 2011 New York Giants were the worst team to win the Super Bowl. They finished the regular season with only a 9-7 record, but they not only made the Super Bowl, but they beat the New England Patriots to win the championship. 
Based on regular season winning percentage, the 2008 Arizona Cardinals (9-7), 1979 Los Angeles Rams (9-7) and 2011 New York Giants (9-7) were the worst teams to make the Super Bowl. Has a team with a losing record ever made the Super Bowl?

There have been three teams with 9-7 records to make it to the Super Bowl: 1979 Rams (lost to the Steelers), 2008 Cardinals (also lost to the Steelers) and the 2011 Giants (beat the Patriots). The 2010 Seahawks are, to date, the only team with a losing record to make the playoffs at all. 
The 2012 Ravens won a Super Bowl but just weren’t very good compared to other championship-winning teams. Their regular-season record was a respectable 10-6, yet that’s hardly the record you’d expect of a championship team.
