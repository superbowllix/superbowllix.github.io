With 31 career Super Bowl receptions, Kelce is just three shy of passing Rice (33) for the most all-time; with 50 receiving yards; he can join Rice (589) as the only players with 400 career  
After seven consecutive years with at least 1,000 receiving yards from 2016-22, Kelce dipped to 984 in 2023 and to 823 this season. His three touchdowns in 2024 marked a career low. 
Kelce holds the record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season (2020) and is only the fifth tight end in history to reach 10,000 receiving yards in his career.

In honor of Kelce — and, by extension, Swift — making the Super Bowl again, DraftKings Sportsbook is offering 33 Swift-inspired prop bets for Super Bowl LIX.
