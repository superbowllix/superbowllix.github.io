        <h2><strong>are super bowl tickets worth it reddit super bowl ad with qr code</strong></h2>
        <p>the reason why super bowl tickets are so expensive is that the football players like to buy nice things for there wife and live in million+ dollar mansions and drive million dollar lambos, and people like the average joe is paying for there luxury toys, this is a life time dream to take my wife to the super bowl, i was planning to buy two  
Between airfare, jacked up hotel rates, Uber, and of course the ticket, and food/drink/pre-game and some light gambling it’s looking like it would cost at least $25k all in for 2 nights. I’ve never been to a Super bowl before and debating whether it is really worth it or not. 
The way I see it it’s more about the fact that you’re there and it’s the Super Bowl. I dunno, I went to a World Series game this year and it was totally worth the price (although I didn’t pay a ridiculous price cause I waited 4 hours in line). And that’s definitely different cause it’s a home crowd so the atmosphere is probably better. 
According to recent data, the average price for a Super Bowl ticket is hovering around $10,000. However, premium seats and luxury packages can easily exceed $50,000. For some fans, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience worth the splurge. 
This year's Super Bowl tickets are at lower prices compared to the same point as last year, according to StubHub. The average ticket price is $8,076, StubHub said, a decrease of 14% from the same

Chiefs season ticket holders will be placed by the team in a Super Bowl ticket lottery immediately after the AFC Championship Game. The Chiefs site lists Super Bowl packages starting at $7,105. 
Super Bowl Ticket Face Value. For Super Bowl 2025, the face value is $950 for the cheapest Super Bowl tickets in the stadium for “nose bleeds” in the upper end zone, and among the most expensive Super Bowl tickets are going for $7,500 for premium seats near the 50-yard line in the 100-level sections. 
As of Sunday, the cheapest ticket at Vivid Seats for Super Bowl LIX between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles was $3,346. The median ticket price is $6,304. 
I went to super bowl 56. I bought the ticket two days after the afccg, and I think I paid around 6,500. That was for upper deck but on the 50 yard line. Lower level started at 11k. My cousin just went to super bowl 58 and had seats in the upper deck and paid around 5k. 
Going to the super bowl has always been on my dads bucket list and this year I think the time is right for me to splurge and treat him to his dream. I was wondering if people had any tips for how to buy Super Bowl tickets (presumably secondary market, at this point) for the best price. Money is not a huge issue but I still would like to not  
I buy Super Bowl tickets when they go on sale in the Spring. Then I wait till late January and if my team doesn’t have a chance to play in the Super Bowl, I sell the tickets for the going rate, which is usually 2.5x the face value. I recoup my initial cost and have money to buy the tickets again in the Spring. 
They put super bowl cushions on the seats to take home alone with a bag of memorabilia. I still have my ticket from the game but I lost my seat cushion. I brought that shit to school every day for like a month in 7th grade. Getting to see the Patriots win their first super bowl my second season really watching football was fucking awesome. 
Same goes for The Masters (toughest ticket in Golf). So you take the most popular sport in the country, add in the fact that it's one game, add in the fact that it's a notch on the belt of rich people to be able to say you went to the Super Bowl, and you get ticket prices that no "normal" family can ever dream of affording. 
If you go, get on line early like 9am, as soon as you get inside do not stop for anything, the jersey's look cool, they will be there later- go to the right of the stage where the Lombardi trophy is, circle around to the back (don't get distracted by the shiny rings) and get on that line first, it gets insanely long. 
We are happy thus far and can definitely say there is profit to be made. What is unfortunate is STH are forced at times to sell tickets on the third party market and most times those are away fans ie the 49ers game. There is reddit thread to sell tickets mkaing sure rhey are sold, or attemtpting to sell to fellow Rams fans.

The Super Bowl is a bucket list event. Not sure if the SB IN Vegas will be "bucket list". I am sure it's gonna be over-hyped and over-priced. Traffic might be bad. The stadium looks a bit out of the way, especially if you don't stay "south strip". I am thinking that going to a Super Bowl (or Wrestle Mania) in New Orleans could be "bucket list  
YES, you will enjoy the game (it’s the SUPER BOWL)! And YES, you should go by yourself if you can! I did exactly this for the NFC Championship and it is a day I never forget. I flew in from NY for the game and spent more money than I would’ve liked on the ticket, but it was so worth it. 
If you’re asking if it’s worth it, then it’s not worth it lol. If blowing $30k doesn’t hurt the bank then do it. If you’re going to be in a pinch counting $ saved for years then no of course it’s not worth it </p>
