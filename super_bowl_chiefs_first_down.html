Kansas City Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco uses a quick jump cut to knife through the line of scrimmage for a 10-yard burst and the Chiefs' first first-down pickup of Super Bowl LVIII. 
Kansas City Chiefs wide receivers have begun a new hand celebration when they gain a first down, and it may be on display in Super  Kansas City Chiefs vs. Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 2025  
Luckily, Super Bowl LVIII lacked an officiating controversy. The key word is “luckily.” As explained on Tuesday’s PFT Live, the first play of the final drive of regulation in Super Bowl LVIII included a bad spot. A very bad spot. An egregiously bad spot. 
The Drive That Won the Chiefs the Super Bowl—and Proved Patrick Mahomes’ Greatness. 5 minute read. By Sean Gregory. February 12, 2024 12:55 AM EST  Mahomes ran eight yards for a first down  
On the Chiefs' overtime drive, they faced a fourth-and-1 with the Super Bowl on the line. Mahomes ran for a first down to keep the game going. He later hit Rashee Rice for a huge first down on  
The Chiefs are the first team to make the Super Bowl in Year 3 after two consecutive championships. Other teams made three straight Super Bowls but lost one of the first two to prevent a three-peat. 
The Chiefs are headed to the Big Easy to face the Eagles in the Super Bowl for the second time in three years. In the first game, they rallied from a 24-14 halftime deficit with Butker hitting a 27-yard field goal for the 38-35 win. 
The Chiefs took over on their own 11 after a 5-yard punt return by Chris Conley off Mitch Wishnowsky’s 54-yard punt. Running back Isiah Pacheco ran for 10 yards on the first play of the drive, picking up the Chiefs’ initial first down of the day. But Chase Young sacked Patrick Mahomes for a 4-yard loss to set back the drive. 
News, analysis and behind-the-scenes stories about the Chiefs' 2024 Super Bowl win.  The 49ers didn’t gain a first down on any of those four. That’s what brought the Chiefs back. 
The Chiefs took over at their own 25-yard line with 1:53 remaining following Jake Moody’s go-ahead field goal. On the first play of the drive, Patrick Mahomes found Travis Kelce for a nine-yard  
The former Dallas Cowboys star, who has never missed an opportunity to undermine Mahomes-led Chiefs, appeared on the recent episode of ESPN’s Get Up. Carrying a green phone case, he reflected on his support for the Eagles and served brotherly advice (sort of) ahead of facing the two-time Super Bowl defending champions in Super Bowl LIX. 
Super Bowl LIX has the makings of a classic, as the Chiefs look to complete the NFL's first three-peat, while the Eagles aim to avenge their loss to Kansas City two years ago. Here are the FOX  
Dropped passes, shoelace tackles, and -- of course -- penalties will play some part in the end result of Super Bowl LIX. I'm sure we all remember the James Bradberry defensive holding call on JuJu Smith-Schuster in Super Bowl LVII that helped the Kansas City Chiefs drain the clock and kick a late field goal to beat the Philadelphia Eagles two  
The Kansas City Chiefs are one game away from making history, and there will be a host of storylines to follow in the Super Bowl as the Philadelphia Eagles look to play the role of spoiler in New  
Late in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LVIII, Mahomes took off on one of his trademark scrambles to convert a 2nd and short for a first down. Unfortunately, as the Chiefs were in scramble mode on their final possession, the CBS graphic couldn’t quite keep up, and thought Kansas City had gained a first down on the 49ers the play before. 
The Philadelphia Eagles are back in the Super Bowl for the third time in eight seasons. Their opponent is a familiar foe in the Kansas City Chiefs, who have been to the Super five of the last six  
Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) scores a touchdown past Philadelphia Eagles safety Marcus Epps (22) during the first quarter in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on  
Last year, the first quarter was scoreless and Super Bowl 55, which the Chiefs lost to the Buccaneers, also had a scoreless quarter. At +420 odds, I'm willing to take a shot. 
Ahead of Super Bowl LIX, relive these must-see highlights from the Kansas City Chiefs running back group, including jaw-dropping moments from Kareem Hunt, Isiah Pacheco and more! </p>
