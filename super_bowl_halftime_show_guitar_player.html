        <p>We should offer a final caveat (before the BIG GUITAR conspiracy theorists take to YouTube) that – as is the case with all Super Bowl halftime shows – the performance was indeed mimed, albeit to a live rehearsal recording. However, focusing on this feels a little churlish: no-one should be questioning H.E.R.’s playing credentials. 
The synchronicity of H.E.R. playing this particular Super Bowl halftime show can’t be understated: When she was 10 years old—performing then as Gabi Wilson—she played an Alicia Keys song on  
Vallejo-native H.E.R. joined headliner Usher and other musicians like Alicia Keys on Sunday during the halftime show at the Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.

Even before that, though, Bettencourt made an appearance on the biggest stage of them all, that of the Super Bowl halftime show. Wielding a special version of his Washburn N4 signature guitar , Bettencourt brought some hard-rock fire to Rihanna's acclaimed performance as a member – for the first time in almost a decade – of the pop  
Whith TV you're in a race against time because sponsors expect the airtime that they paid for in whatever time slot. Live performance can make a shows run time a moving target if it gets crazy with solos and glitches. The super bowl would be a musicians specialty in that they can showcase their ability run their machine without an editor live.
