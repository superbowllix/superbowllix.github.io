        <h2><strong>super bowl history spreads what super bowl did the eagles win and what was the score</strong></h2>
        <p>For this year’s Super Bowl, the Kansas City Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites over the Philadelphia Eagles with a posted total of 48.5 points. The odds on the Super Bowl have been known to change, and there’s still a few days until the game. 
Super Bowl History For Spread And Totals Betting. Historical data shows that Super Bowl winners almost always cover the spread. A comprehensive look at past winners reveals this trend to be a constant, as the eventual winner has covered the spread in nine of the last 10 games, and 17 of the past 20. 
Super Bowl 59 is now upon us, as the NFL prepares to kickoff 2025 Super Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana at 6:30pm ET. Before betting the big game, you may want to know what has happened in previous Super Bowls with similar narratives, or even the most recent results. 
SUPER BOWL SPREADS. Through the first 58 Super Bowls, the NFC has gone 29-29 against the AFC. The Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots have the most Super Bowl wins at six, while the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers both have five. Favorites have gone 37-20 straight up and 29-24-2 against the spread in Super Bowl history. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
The largest point spread in Super Bowl history was in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995. The San Francisco 49ers entered the game as massive 18.5-point favorites over the San Diego Chargers. Incredibly, the  
Four times in Super Bowl history has the spread crossed over the key numbers of 3, 7, 10, 14 or 17 between the opening and closing point spreads, or crossed through zero. Three of the four times the line movement has predicted the SU and ATS winner, with the exception being Super Bowl 48, when the Broncos closed as favorites and lost 43-8. 
Full Super Bowl Betting History. And now, a comprehensive rundown of the betting history for each Super Bowl through Super Bowl LVII. At each step, we’ll log how the favorite has done straight up (SU) and against the spread (ATS), as well as over/under results. Super Bowl I – Super Bowl X. SB I | Packers (-14) 35-10 Chiefs Favorite SU: 1-0  
If you’re looking for a big edge, you won’t find it in the Super Bowl wins by conference stat. After the Rams win in SB 56, the NFC now has a two-win edge with a 29-27 straight-up record. The ATS numbers are similar with the NFC having a 28-26-2 mark and the AFC of course would have a 26-28-2 record against the spread. 
The following provides a detailed analysis of every Super Bowl spread and total (if available) since the inaugural Super Bowl in 1967 through 2023. The score and winner of each game, including the ATS (against the spread) winner and over/under result, have been listed. At a basic level, there are no significant outlying trends. 
Despite going into the 2021 season with 12-1 Super Bowl odds, Los Angeles became the largest pregame favorite at -200 odds to win the title. The Chiefs (+500) entered this season as the favorite  
Here’s a list of the smallest spreads in Super Bowl history. 10 2014: Denver Broncos (-2.5) vs. Seattle Seahawks. Elsa/Getty Images. 9 1971: Baltimore Colts (-2.5) vs. Dallas Cowboys. 
The biggest spread in a Super Bowl is 18 – which has happened twice in history. The first 18-point spread was in the aforementioned Super Bowl III between the Jets and Colts, with New York

Super Bowl 59 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles has a close spread. The Chiefs are only favored by 1.5 points, which, in theory, should mean the game will be close. 
Let’s examine the NFL betting trends through the history of the Super Bowl. Moneyline results and against the spread. The favorite has a clear edge in Super Bowl history when it comes to winning the game outright. The favorite is 36-18 — with Super Bowl XLIX being a pick at kickoff — in Super Bowl history.
