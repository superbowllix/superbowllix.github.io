Popular markets for NFL futures include Super Bowl odds, NFL MVP odds, and team win totals. Be sure to take advantage of sportsbook promos like odds boosts and bonus bets to maximize your potential payouts on these long-term wagers. 
If you think your favorite team (or one that you love to hate) will win the next Super Bowl, you can easily place a Super Bowl futures bet on that team.

Expert Tip: Betting on a team to win the AFC or NFC conference can be a lower-risk, high-value alternative to picking a team to win the Super Bowl. Track the odds for conference winner futures throughout the season to maximize your bet.

Patrons can begin wagering on Super Bowl odds for the next season within hours of the Lombardi Trophy being won. Super Bowl odds are available throughout the offseason, and then the regular season, with oddsmakers adjusting prices
