The average offense is ranked almost 6 spots higher than the average defense for a Super Bowl winner since 2017 (Offense 3.8, Defense 9.5). Five of the six last winners had a top 5 offense (2017 Eagles 3rd, 2018 Patriots 4th, 2019 Chiefs 5th, 2020 Bucs 3rd, and the 2022 Chiefs 1st). 
The Kansas City Chiefs won in Super Bowl LVIII against the 49ers on February 11. 
The average defensive rank for a Superbowl winner is 5.63 while the average offensive rank is 6.10 and the average CRA is 5.87 Before 2006 the only team to win a Superbowl with a CRA below 10 were the 1968 Jets The Mannings have never won a Superbowl on a team with a CRA above 12.5

They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, giving them four Super Bowl appearances in five years and putting them one win away from three consecutive Super Bowl titles. In the intervening year, they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver  
As more and more people say its becoming an offensive league I wanted to look it up. A maybe more definitive stats even is other than these wins, brady has wins with the 8th and 6th best defenses. EVERY OTHER TEAM WAS TOP 3. making 10/17 superbowl winners a top 3 scoring defense. So yes defenses still does win championships. 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
I mean, every QB gets carried to the Super Bowl to some extent or another. Bad teams don’t win Super Bowls. Above average teams rarely win Super Bowls, and when they do, they’re not playing like one. Great teams win the vast majority of Super Bowls, and while the QB is obviously the reason most great teams are great, it’s a team effort. 
15 of the last 26 Super Bowl winners were top 10 in both offense and defense. What is interesting is that in the 90s it was very common for balanced things to win, then in the early 2000s you don't see many of them, but five of the last 6 winners were balanced. 
There are cases where a defense was badly ranked during the regular season and played great in the playoffs, same thing with offenses. This is just to give a better general idea of where those teams stood through the season. Teams that won with balance. 14 of the last 25 Super Bowl winners were top 10 in both offense and defense. 
Defense wins in the NFL. Nine of the last 12 Super Bowl winners had a defense ranked in the top 10. By contrast, only six of the past 12 Super Bowl winners fielded a top-10 offense. 
5. 1966 Packers . Vince Lombardi's 1966 defense is a major reason why the Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. The '66 Packers defense, a unit that allowed just 11.6 points per game during the  
It is also worth noting that four of the last 20 Super Bowl champions have had the top-ranked defense, while only one has had the top-ranked offense. The Pittsburgh Steelers hold the record for the lowest-ranked offense to win the Super Bowl since 2003, with their 2009 defeat of the Arizona Cardinals. 
Their top-tier Super Bowl defense regressed to 11th in '06, and Big Ben finished with 18 touchdown passes and a league-high 23 interceptions. Pittsburgh started 2-6 and could not recover in an 8-8  
Pittsburgh won 21-10 and head coach Bill Cowher and running back Jerome Bettis were able to retire as Super Bowl champions. The 2005 Steelers were the first team to win a Super Bowl as a No. 6  
The Kansas City Chiefs won in Super Bowl LVII versus the Eagles on February 12. teams to win a super bowl without a top 10 defense The Kansas City Chiefs won in Super Bowl LVII versus the Eagles on February 12. 
Over the past 10 seasons, the average Super Bowl winner earned the seventh-best passing grade. It's no surprise that elite QB play is the most consistent factor among champs. On the flip side, the average Super Bowl champion had just the 18 th-ranked pass-blocking grade. This mark was solidified by the 2014 Patriots and 2011 Giants, who were  
Top five: Out of 53 Super Bowl winners since the merger, 45 (85%) were ranked top five in either offense or defense. 32 were ranked top five on offense. 30 were ranked top five on defense. 17 were ranked top five in both. The 2017 Eagles were the last Super Bowl winner to be ranked top 5 in offense (3rd) and defense (4th) 
It’s only the third time that neither defense in the Super Bowl is top 10 in yards allowed. The only other examples were Super Bowl 46 — a rematch for the Patriots and Giants — and Super  </p>
