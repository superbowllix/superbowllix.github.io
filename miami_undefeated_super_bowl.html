Super Bowl VII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Miami Dolphins and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Washington Redskins to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1972 season. 
The 1972 Miami Dolphins finished 17-0 and won Super Bowl VII over the Washington Redskins. The '72 Dolphins have remained the only NFL team to complete an entire season undefeated. That season, the team ranked first in the NFL in total offense, total defense, scoring offense and scoring defense. 
The Dolphins defeated the Washington Redskins 14-7 in Super Bowl VII on Jan. 14, 1973 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to finish 17-0.

The Dolphins were the first team to reach the Super Bowl with a perfect record. The second team to do so, the 2007 Patriots, rode an 18-game winning streak into Super Bowl XLII but lost that game  
A year after the Dolphins were hammered 24-3 by the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl 6, Twilley scored the franchise’s first Super Bowl touchdown, a 28-yarder from Bob Griese that gave the Dolphins
