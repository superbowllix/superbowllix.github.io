Alicia Keys for 2025! Home.  Alicia Keys' Voice Crack Edited Out of Super Bowl Halftime Show. Relli; Feb 13, 2024;  Lipstick Alley Bloggers.

Usher performs with Alicia Keys during the Apple Music halftime show at the NFL Super Bowl LVIII football at Allegiant Stadium on February 11, 2024, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Michael Owens/Getty Images We‚Äôll get to Usher‚Äôs halftime show in just a second, but let‚Äôs first acknowledge its most talked-about moment. 
A little sneak peek of how it all came together üí´ The puppeteers, the rehearsals and everything it takes to prepare for the Super Bowl Halftime show LVIII! 
Alicia Keys appeared by surprise on the stage of the 2024 Super Bowl to accompany Usher at the halftime show, giving that sensual and feminine touch to the night. The singer starred alongside the Grammy winner in the hottest moment of the show, as together they performed and danced with great passion to the song ‚ÄúMy Boo‚Äù, showing us that there is still great chemistry between them. 
I like Alicia Keys but she doesn't seem to want to stay in her lane as it pertains to her vocal range. Personally, I think Missy should headline next, but I think Taylor Swift is next up. I wouldn't be shocked if Taylor end up being the artist who gets the most allotted amount of time. I'm clocking it now, she will get at least 20 mins to perform. 
Performance or not. IMO it‚Äôs inappropriate for someone to hug on someone like that who‚Äôs married. You don‚Äôt know if their spouse would be ok with it or not. 
Unnecessary. Raymond doesn‚Äôt need any guests. He only has 12 minutes or so to perform and he has enough hits and the performance skills to carry it on his own. I'm honestly surprised by this. He has so many solo hits that people want to hear. I guess maybe this will be a "break" between the 
Boosie says Usher made Alicia Keys uncomfortable during their Super Bowl performance.  Alicia Keys on secret to strong marriage after 13 years: "If you can‚Äôt  
Damn y'all don't even want Alicia to sing my boo for less than 30 seconds?! 
That voice crack at the super bowl was just the most famous one. For a decade now, Alicia has had some very awful live moments. People really dislike her because of the Swizz Beats controversy. (Which I think is unfair) She gets all the blame. 
Usher did the damn thang! We were getting our whole lives. I really loved 'Yeah' with the skates and him bringing Atlanta to the stage. Alicia could have stayed at home though. 
It was light hearted but you know the kids today still always find something. Usher was amazing, Alicia look great and still killing it. This generation needs to go look for their generation Usher and Alicia because some of the acts today can‚Äôt perform at all or don‚Äôt even have stage presence. 
Did y'all see how Usher looked at Alicia Keys today and how he hugged her? Side eyeing that the hug was from behind too smh And yall already know the infamous gif with Alicia locking eyes with Kerry, had Kerry feeling something that went all through the body it seemed. 
I like it. It's a little inspirational song. Very different from what she's known for. </p>
