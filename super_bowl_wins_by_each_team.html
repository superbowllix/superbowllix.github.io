        <p>However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. 
Winning team and Losing team columns indicate the number of times that team has appeared in a Super Bowl as well as each respective teams' Super Bowl record to date. Venue column indicates number of times that stadium has hosted a Super Bowl. City column indicates number of times that metropolitan area has hosted a Super Bowl.
