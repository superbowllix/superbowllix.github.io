        <p>Super Bowl History For Spread And Totals Betting. Historical data shows that Super Bowl winners almost always cover the spread. A comprehensive look at past winners reveals this trend to be a constant, as the eventual winner has covered the spread in nine of the last 10 games, and 17 of the past 20. 
For this year’s Super Bowl, the Kansas City Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites over the Philadelphia Eagles with a posted total of 48.5 points. The odds on the Super Bowl have been known to change, and there’s still a few days until the game.

The largest point spread in Super Bowl history was in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995. The San Francisco 49ers entered the game as massive 18.5-point favorites over the San Diego Chargers.

A crucial step to betting on the Super Bowl is understanding how the odds work. American odds represent how much money you would win on a $100 wager - or, in some cases, how much money you would
