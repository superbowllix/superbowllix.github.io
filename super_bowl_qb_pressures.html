Hurts, on the other hand, is trying to make up for an oh-so-close Super Bowl bout with Mahomes to close the 2022 season. At 26, he's already the first Eagles quarterback to ever reach two Super  
First, a general comment on the nine unblocked pressures in the Super Bowl. Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spanuolo deserves a ton of credit for this game plan but it’s hardly the first time this offense with Shanahan has faced unblocked rushers that negatively affect plays. It just happened to be against a top 3 defense in the Super Bowl. 
When the Eagles won the Super Bowl in 2018, backup quarterback Nick Foles calmly executed a trick play on fourth-and-goal, becoming the first player in history to both throw and catch a touchdown  
49ers film room: What is a quarterback pressure? Part 2 - Using examples from the Super Bowl and preseason to show the differences Today we look at a common trope that the 49ers offensive line allowed 9 unblocked pressures in the Super Bowl, what a quarterback pressure is/isn't, and we'll look examples from the preseason later. 
In Super Bowl LVIII, the Kansas City Chiefs found ways to get to San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy. One of the keys to the Chiefs winning the Super Bowl was the pressure the defense had  
Working behind reserves on both bookends, Mahomes faced more pressures (29) than any quarterback in Super Bowl history, going down twice on sacks and flailing helplessly on three times as many  
Super Bowl: Patrick Mahomes exudes calm, poise as Chiefs chase history The quarterback, who has led Kansas City to 17 consecutive one-possession wins, flourishes under pressure.

Winston, O’Connell (11.86 PKP% under pressure) and Flacco (11.43%) have also been the most generous QB this season. Winston, who recently told reporters that he was praying to be liberated from his habit of throwing Pick-6s, has given defenses a chance at an interception on 11.96% of his pressured attempts. 
The Super Bowl puts a ton of pressure on both teams playing in it. Without a doubt, the 49ers and the Chiefs will be feeling it on game day. Some players will revel in it, while others will get  
Ben Roethlisberger won two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 and 2009, becoming one of the youngest quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl in his first victory. “Big Ben” was known

Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones forces San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy into a throwaway at a critical time and prevents a potential go-ahead touchdown in overtime on a third-down red zone play. 
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive unit finished the regular season top five in sacks (48.0) and quarterback pressures (189), and it carried over into the postseason during their eventual Super  
Now, Burrow and the Bengals’ offensive line will square off against Aaron Donald, Von Miller and the Rams’ daunting pass rush in Super Bowl LVI on Sunday.. Meanwhile, Rams quarterback Matthew  
It was certainly reminiscent of Donald's performance against Burrow last postseason, when he had 2.0 sacks, three QB hits and seven pressures in the Rams' Super Bowl LVI win. Now, it's time for  
25. Terry Bradshaw, Super Bowl XIV (Steelers 31, Rams 19) 14 of 21 fo 309 yards, 2 TD, 3 INT; The only quarterback to win MVP honors with three interceptions. 
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS — SUPER BOWL LIV. Although the 49ers ultimately fell to the Chiefs, Bosa still recorded one of the most dominant defensive outings we have ever seen. The rookie lived in the Chiefs’ backfield, generating a whopping 12 QB pressures — most in a Super Bowl — that included one QB hit and one sack. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl.
