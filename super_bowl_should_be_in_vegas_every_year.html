        <h2><strong>super bowl should be in vegas every year who played in super bowl xii</strong></h2>
        <p>Four-time Super Bowl champion and Fox NFL Sunday analyst Rob Gronkowski has said the Super Bowl should be played in Las Vegas every year, and so has Las Vegas resident and UFC CEO Dana White. 
The idea was brought up multiple times in the week leading up to the NFL championship game: maybe the Super Bowl should be held in Las Vegas every year. It was the first time the gaming capital of the world had hosted the biggest American sports event of the year, but it set two remarkable records. 
All eyes were on Las Vegas to see how the Super Bowl would play out, and marketing executive Zev Norotsky was so impressed, he thinks it should play host for the game every year. 
UFC CEO Dana White believes Las Vegas should host the Super Bowl every year. During the Power Slap 6 Post-Fight Press Conference, White told NFL commissioner Roger Goodell exactly that. 
The NFL never officially awarded Las Vegas the 2025 Super Bowl but it was considered a shoo-in after New Orleans was initially announced as the 2024 site.  A five-year wait for Las Vegas would

The Dallas-Fort Worth metro area has hosted just one Super Bowl, in 2011. That was two years after Jerry World opened in 2009. Jones currently is 82, and by 2029, he'll be 86 (if he's still with us). 
The soonest Las Vegas could land another Super Bowl would be 2028, since the league has already set two California locations for the next two big games after New Orleans next year. Ackers wrote Las Vegas “lived up to the massive hype of hosting the game in the entertainment capital of the world.” 
During Super Bowl XLVII between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers — Joffray’s last experience leading the committee in New Orleans — “We wanted the message out there that the Super Bowl should be in New Orleans every year,” he said. And what will be the message in Las Vegas? 
They’re favored in the betting market, by 1.5 points, after entering both Super Bowl 57 against the Eagles in 2023 and Super Bowl 58 against the 49ers in 2024 as small underdogs. 
LAS VEGAS — Imagine the NFL playing the Super Bowl in Las Vegas every year. If Raiders owner Mark Davis had his way, the Big Game would have a permanent spot at Allegiant Stadium in Southern Nevada. 
Kinda bs that every new stadium gets to host the super bowl in its 2nd year. Yet Vegas, who paid $750m for the stadium, (the most public money ever for a sports stadium) had to have the Super bowl land on mardi gras and New Orleans to want to switch years, to be able to host the super bowl in its 4th year lol

The 2024 Super Bowl between the Chiefs and 49ers takes place in Las Vegas, and UFC CEO Dana White told Roger Goodell to host it there again. 
LAS VEGAS — Imagine the NFL playing the Super Bowl in Las Vegas every year. If Raiders owner Mark Davis had his way, the Big Game would have a permanent spot at Allegiant Stadium in Southern Nevada. 
I’ve gone every year for the Super Bowl for 15 years. It’s an amazing place to watch the big game there is no where better. But this year it’s in Vegas and I don’t think I can afford to. I’m a small potatoes gambler and even then i usually get to stay for free that weekend. The cheapest MgM hotels for me that weekend are like $400 a night
