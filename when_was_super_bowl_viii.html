The NFL awarded Super Bowl VIII to Houston on March 21, 1972, at the owners' meetings held in Honolulu. For the first time, multiple Super Bowl sites were selected at a single meeting, as hosts for both VII and VIII were named. 
Super Bowl VIII was the eighth edition of the Super Bowl and was played on January 13th, 1974, at Rice Stadium in Houston, Texas. The game featured the Miami Dolphins, who finished the 1973 season  
Super Bowl VIII. Thanks to Dolphins running back Larry Csonka's close brush with injury, Super Bowl VIII was the final game where: a) Goal posts were stationed in front of the end zone . 
Rushing touchdowns: Miami vs. Minnesota (SB VIII), Chicago vs. New England (SB XX), San Francisco vs. Denver (SB XXIV), Denver vs. Green Bay (SB XXXII), Kansas City vs. Philadelphia (SB LVII) - 4  
The lead-up to Super Bowl VIII was unprecedented. The Miami Dolphins became the first team to qualify for three consecutive championships, a brand new city volunteered to host the big game (Houston, Texas), and both teams went into Super Bowl VIII with the same regular-season record (12-2). January 13, 1974, brought together reigning Super Bowl [] 
Super Bowl VIII had all the excitement and suspense of a master butcher quartering a steer. The slaughterhouse was Houston's Rice Stadium and the butcher was Miami Quarterback Bob Griese, whose deft dismemberment of the Minnesota Vikings may have had a certain esthetic appeal for serious students of the science of football, but left devotees of drama more than a little bored.
