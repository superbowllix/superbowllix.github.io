        <p>Super Bowl LVII has all the ingredients to be a classic, but the Eagles and Chiefs have a lot to live up to. Here are the top 10 greatest Super Bowls of all time. 
The first-ever Super Bowl took place on Jan. 15, 1967, and saw the Green Bay Packers beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-10. Including that inaugural Super Bowl, there have been a total of 56. In those 56 Super Bowls, we have seen players become legends, teams become dynasties, and plays become immortalized in the football replay vault. 
HM. Super Bowl XXXVI: Patriots 20, Rams 17. Nobody saw Tom Brady coming at this point. This emotional game, played in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, was all about Kurt Warner and St. Louis  
In the Super Bowl -- even though they were a defensive team -- offensively, Phil Simms (22-25, 268 yards and three touchdowns) really played over his head. That was the difference." 
16. Super Bowl LIV: Kansas City Chiefs 31, San Francisco 49ers 20. 15. Super Bowl XLV: Green Bay Packers 31, Pittsburgh Steelers 25. 14. Super Bowl LII: Philadelphia Eagles 41, New England  
The Buffalo Bills generally consider the ’91 Redskins to be the best of the four Super Bowls teams that beat them.  This game still holds the record for the coldest Super Bowl ever played  
Senior sports correspondent Sean Gregory ranks the best and worst Super Bowls ever.  The Best. 4. Super Bowl XXXIV: January 30, 2000, Georgia Dome in Atlanta  yard short of the end zone on  
Yes, this was the first Super Bowl, but it was not the best Super Bowl. Leading by four in the second half, the Packers tallied 21 unanswered points. 42. 1974: Miami Dolphins 24, Minnesota Vikings 7 
From last minute touchdowns to huge upsets, DAZN looks at the best ever Super Bowls. The Super Bowl is commonly referred to as the greatest show on earth, and while a few have disappointed over the years the vast majority have lived up to the hype. Super Bowl LVII in February 2023 had a viewership  
2. Super Bowl XLII: New York Giants 17, New England Patriots 14 (2008) The Patriots had been undefeated all season and were heavy favourites, but the game was closer than expected.
