        <p>113 is individual viewers. The household rating per the article is 40. Google says 1 ratings point is 1.156M viewers so that means about 46 million households had the game on. I would imagine Nielsen tries to capture things like parties, people watching in bars, etc but I have no idea how accurate those measurements would be. 
Yeah, worldwide the Super Bowl pales in comparison to anything soccer related, the Euro final in 2020 got 328 million people, The 2023 Champions League final got 450 million people worldwide and the 2022 World Cup final got 1.5 billion people. 
Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 remains No. 1 in viewers all time with 114.44 million viewers (not including any out of home counts). Russell Wilson vs that other guy Reply reply 
The average viewership number for this Super Bowl was 115,096,000. The air date for Super Bowl LVII was on February 12, 2023. 1. Super Bowl LVIII: Kansas City Chiefs vs San Francisco 49ers. Super Bowl LVIII was aired on CBS. In the most watched Super Bowl, the Chiefs defeated the 49ers 25-22 in overtime. 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets  
Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched program in television history, with an average of 123.7 million viewers tuning in to the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win versus the 49ers. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
The Super Bowl on Sunday drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers who watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in a nail-biting overtime triumph, CBS Sports said in a

Year: The season in question. The Super Bowl is, of course, played after New Year's. W/L: Whether the team won or lost the Super Bowl Rate: The QB's Passer rating Avg: Average Passing rating for the league that year Pl: Rank the QB was among starting QBs for that year. - means they did not qualify during the regular season. 
The coronavirus is a huge reason but I still remember having these same conservations in 2019. The ratings of championships of American sports were already on a slight downward trend. Nothing huge and it was a very recent trend so we don’t know for sure but the ratings for the 2022 Super Bowl will be very telling. 
Because ratings of specific demographics are what matters. BMW isn't going to buy a highly rated show whose demographics are children, for example, because that's not their consumer. So high ratings, wouldn't equal revenue in that case. But it would for a toy maker. Demographics are what matters to advertisers. Ratings are considered well after  
Might be THE best Super Bowl ad I've ever seen, or at least the most gutsy. You have a silly ass advertisement mascot that everyone loves to hate for the phrase "dilly dilly" get brutally, and I mean BRUTALLY, murdered in front of 100 million television viewers with squishy sounds and everything as The Mountain crushed his head, and that's followed by incinerating the Dilly Dilly Royal Family. 
Before this, the biggest telecast of all time was last year’s Super Bowl game between the Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. It was initially named the third most-watched, ranking behind the 2015 and 2017 Super Bowls which brought in 114.4 million and 113.7 million viewers, respectively. 
Kurt Warner's 3 Super Bowl stats averaged out to a 17 game season: 6,550 yards, 34 TDs, 17 INTs, 62.9% completion, 8.76.YPA, 96.6 passer rating. Obviously a smaller sample.size, but I couldn't help myself. Pretty sure at one point Warner had the top three spots for passing yards in a Super Bowl. 
Eli Manning's passer rating in the 2007 Super Bowl was 87.3, not 73.9 (and Brady's is wrong too), and Tom Brady's passer rating in last year's game was 91.1, not 105.6 (and Manning's is wrong too.) And those are the first two games I checked. 
There was a playthrough on YouTube that I watched years ago where the guy modded Tecmo Superbowl 2. The mod was the best teams of all time, it featured the 2001 Ravens and I think the 1996 Packers (along with the other 30 best rated rosters). 
Sports Illustrated even labeled the 94’ NFC Championship “The Real Super Bowl” because the SB was an afterthought, the 49ers and Cowboys were by far and away the best 2 teams in the NFL Reply reply
