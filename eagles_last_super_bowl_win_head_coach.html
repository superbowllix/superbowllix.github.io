        <p>The Eagles joined the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team in 1933. Currently members of the Eastern Division of the National Football Conference (NFC), the team has won four NFL titles and made four Super Bowl appearances (1980, 2004, 2017, and 2022), with their first Super Bowl victory coming in Super Bowl LII under Doug Pederson. 
Have the Eagles ever won a Super Bowl?  have to look much further to find their last Super Bowl appearance – and win.  it back to the Super Bowl under now-Chiefs head coach Andy Reid  
Pederson – who would go onto win the Eagles’ first ever Super Bowl title as head coach in 2018 – remembers how organized Reid was and how it impacted his own coaching style. 
There was the overlooked quarterback, the underestimated head coach, and the demoted general manager, all of whom banded together to form the foundation of Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl-winning team. The 2017-18 Eagles embodied the spirit and the persona and the bite of their hometown. A team of

The Eagles’ coach during the 2017 season — the last time the Eagles were in the Super Bowl — was Doug Pederson. The Eagles beat the Patriots, 41-33, and quarterback Nick Foles won MVP. Pederson was the head coach of the Eagles from 2016-20. After taking the 2021 season off, he became head coach of the Jaguars in 2022. Eagles Head Coaches 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
Three coaches have won NFL championships with the team: Earl "Greasy" Neale in 1948 and 1949, Buck Shaw in 1960, and Pederson in Super Bowl LII. [1] Andy Reid is the all-time leader in games coached and wins, [ 2 ] while Sirianni has the highest winning percentage with .676 (with at least one full season coached). 
The Chiefs won that game, 38-35, which means the Eagles will get a chance at revenge during this year’s Super Bowl. Philadelphia won the Super Bowl in 2018 over the New England Patriots, so this  
Accolades: Led the Eagles to two Super Bowl appearances since becoming head coach in 2021; Strengths: Offensive creativity, player development, and a strong motivator; Fun Fact: Sirianni played wide receiver at Mount Union and won three Division III national championships.

The Philadelphia Eagles have won one Super Bowl in franchise history. The Eagles were champions of the 2017 NFL season after beating the Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. Before the Super Bowl era, the Eagles won three NFL Championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960.

The Eagles last made the Super Bowl just two seasons ago against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 57. During that season, Jalen Hurts first emerged as an MVP candidate. His partnership with head coach Nick Sirianni immediately led to outstanding results for the team, which ran through the NFC with an unreal average margin of victory (27.5
