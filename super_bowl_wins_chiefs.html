        <h2><strong>super bowl wins chiefs super bowl shuffle chicago bears video</strong></h2>
        <p>The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (Super Bowl I).. The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). 
The Chiefs' most recent trip to the Super Bowl was in 2025. They downed the Bills, 32-29 in the AFC championship to advance to their third-straight Super Bowl and fifth in the past six years. 
Below is the complete list of Chiefs Super Bowl appearances dating back to Super Bowl 1, which was played in 1967. Super Bowl 1: Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 Super Bowl 4: Kansas  
How many times have the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl? The Kansas City Chiefs have won a total of 4 Super Bowls, in 1969, 2019 and 2022-2023. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in Kansas City. 
They won Super Bowl 54 against the 49ers in 2020, then lost in Super Bowl 55 to Tom Brady and the Buccaneers in 2021. After that, the Chiefs went to (and won) back-to-back Super Bowls in each of  
Feb. 11, 2024: An overtime win for Kansas City — The Chiefs became the first back-to-back Super Bowl champion in two decades when they defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime at Super  
With a win, the Chiefs would join the Steelers, Patriots, 49ers and Cowboys as the only franchises that have won at least five Super Bowls. Kansas City won its fourth Super Bowl following last  
The Kansas City Chiefs will face off against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII today at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Chiefs have been the most dominant team in the NFL since Patrick Mahomes became the starting quarterback in the 2018 season, with Kansas City making its fourth Super Bowl appearance in the last five seasons. 
The most recent Kansas City Chiefs win came in 2024 at Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas against the San Francisco 49ers. It was a cagey affair between the two teams and going into the fourth quarter, the 49ers held a slim 13-10 lead at the end of the third. 
The Chiefs’ First Super Bowl Win. Kansas City played in the first-ever Super Bowl, facing the Green Bay Packers. At the time, it was actually called the AFL-NFL World Championship. The Packers beat the Chiefs, 35-10, and Bart Starr was named MVP of the game. Three years later, the Chiefs returned to the Super Bowl. 
Why: Another close win for the Chiefs to complete the three-peat as Chris Jones takes advantage of the Eagles' OL injuries to win Super Bowl MVP. Mike Band: Chiefs 24, Eagles 20 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles play on Sunday, Feb. 9 at Caesars Superdome in the Super Bowl game of the NFL playoffs.. Will the Eagles or the Chiefs win the Super Bowl? The Chiefs  
The Kansas City Chiefs stand on the brink of history. With one more victory, they’ll become the first team in NFL history to win three straight Super Bowls. It’s a feat that would cement  
Expect the Chiefs to pull out another tight Super Bowl win, this time with a 23-20 final score. GREATEST SUPER BOWL PLAYERS: Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce make cut, but so do 2 Eagles Super Bowl  
Then, the Chiefs didn’t reach the Super Bowl for 50 years before winning 31-20 over the San Francisco 49ers to cap off the 2019 season with the franchise’s second Super Bowl win. The Chiefs fell to the Bucs the following year before winning the Super Bowl 38-35 over the Eagles in 2022 and 25-22 in 2023 vs the 49ers. 
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. 
Before the rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl kicks off, take a look back at the Chiefs’ Super Bowl history.. Super Bowl LVIII, 2024. Who did the Chiefs play? San Francisco 49ers. Did the Chiefs win  
The Chiefs have been to the Super Bowl six times in franchise history, posting a 4-2 record in the Big Game. Of course, you obviously notice that the Mahomes era has been the most lucrative. 
Super Bowl 55 (2021): Chiefs 9, Buccaneers 31 — L Super Bowl 57 (2023): Chiefs 38, Eagles 35 — W Mahomes is now responsible for four of the Chiefs' six Super Bowl appearances. 
The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will square off in the 2025 Super Bowl. Here are the latest predictions on who will win the big game. </p>
