Electric carmaker Tesla will face a hit on Super Bowl Sunday, when an ad will play showing the alleged dangers of its Full Self-Driving technology. 
Tesla critic Dan O’Dowd is funding a Super Bowl ad campaign highlighting dangers of the company’s driver-assistance software for the second year in a row. The Washington Post Story by Faiz

Lost amid Sunday’s overtime thriller, a controversial Super Bowl ad criticized Tesla’s Full-Self Driving (FSD) Beta Mode for being unsafe and unreliable, including around school bus stops. The ad was created by the Dawn Project , which has the goal of “making computers safe for humanity,” according to its website. 
A pair of Super Bowl ads went after Tesla’s self-driving technology Sunday, asking viewers to boycott the company and claiming that its vehicles are unsafe. The Dawn Project’s ads follow a  
Tesla ended up sending a cease-and-desist letter to the Dawn Project over the campaign, but it didn’t deter the group, which actually launched an anti-Tesla ad at the Super Bowl last year. Now

Tesla Full Self-Driving is going to be criticized by Dan O’Dowd’s Dawn Project in an advertisement that will air during the Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. 
For context: The Dawn Project’s ads follow a 2023 Super Bowl ad campaign that featured an Autopilot-driven Tesla mowing down child-sized dummies in a parking lot. “Here’s what Elon Musk doesn’t want you to know: He sells defective self-driving software by telling consumers it is many times safer than a human driver, when in fact it
