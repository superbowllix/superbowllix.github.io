        <h2><strong>super bowl sunday and human trafficking super bowl lviii for free online</strong></h2>
        <p>With a million party-minded football fans flocking to Minneapolis for Sunday's Super Bowl - dubbed the biggest trafficking event in the United States - dozens of agencies are gearing up to bust  
This Super Bowl season, we appreciate the efforts of hotel workers, Uber drivers, airline and airport staff, fans and the football players themselves who are striving to raise awareness of human trafficking. Along with other anti-trafficking groups, Our Rescue wants to stress the importance of fighting for this cause all year long. 
THE CLAIM: Super Bowl = mass sex trafficking? Claims around the link between sporting events and human trafficking seem to have first arisen around the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. There were reports that Greece saw a 95% increase in human trafficking during 2004, which was attributed to the games. 
January was Human Trafficking Awareness month. The Super Bowl, which historically has been linked to an increase in sex trafficking, will be played at State Farm Stadium on Feb. 12. What better time, then, to check in with Samantha Calvin, an instructor in Arizona State University’s Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation. 
Las Vegas Super Bowl Host Committee Charities and the NFL have joined forces to help combat the issue of human trafficking by giving financial support to Signs of HOPE, a nonprofit that helps

The Oregon-based anti-trafficking group set up shop in Atlanta for 10 days to hold public information sessions on signs of human trafficking and what to expect during the Super Bowl. 
Because of this, the Super Bowl is now associated with human trafficking awareness campaigns. While it's a less sensational headline, it is significantly more troubling that sex trafficking and labor trafficking are a problem every day, worldwide. There are nearly 28 million people trapped in human trafficking. 
Using the Super Bowl, or other major events, to raise awareness and educate about human trafficking has some benefits. The Super Bowl brings interest, attention and resources to help a host city build or strengthen its response to human trafficking, and the NFL has invested in helping these efforts surrounding this year’s Super Bowl. 
Now, human trafficking is a focus of the upcoming Super Bowl in Miami. According to a report by the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office, Florida ranks third nationwide in human trafficking cases  
Geoff Bennett: More than 100 million viewers are expected to tune into the Super Bowl on Sunday being held in the Phoenix metro area. The stadium is expected to be packed with more than 70,000

With tens of thousands flooding into Las Vegas for the Super Bowl on Sunday, one nonprofit is partnering with the police to keep people, particularly young women, safe.

The Super Bowl (as in the football game coming up this Sunday) is the largest, most-watched single-day sporting event in the world. Given that the Atlanta Falcons haven’t made it to the Super Bowl since 2010, their game against the Patriots on Sunday might just be one of the most tuned into yet. 
This report is the second of two phases of a study exploring sex trafficking and the Super Bowl. In 2014, the first phase of the study was conducted and dispelled a number of myths related to sex trafficking and the Super Bowl, particularly relating to the Super Bowl acting as a causal factor for increased sex trafficking. </p>
