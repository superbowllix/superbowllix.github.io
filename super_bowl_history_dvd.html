As a die hard Dallas Cowboys Fan I liked this 2 Disc box set but I didn't love it. They break down every Superbowl season Dallas won into two parts: what was going on around the league during that season, and then the actual Superbowl game between Dallas and the opponent. 
For the first time in NFL History, a Super Bowl Champion was crowned on their own home turf as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers captured their second Vince Lombardi Trophy. Tampa Bay made history with Tom Brady turning the franchise 17-year playoff win drought into Super Bowl glory, with a 31-9 victory over the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs. 
Greatest Moments in Super Bowl History DVD (2002 NFL Productions, LLC) Sealed. 
As an extra bonus, the DVD set comes with a replica Super Bowl ticket (I got Super Bowl X) and a booklet that features pictures from each game, the MVP, the winning team's Super Bowl ring, both team's lineup, the game's box score, the cover to the game program, and picture of a game ticket. This booklet is nicely done. FINAL THOUGHTS 
Road to XLVI chronicles the improbable playoff run of the 2011 Super Bowl Champion New York Giants by presenting the original television broadcasts of each of their four post-season games. Product details
