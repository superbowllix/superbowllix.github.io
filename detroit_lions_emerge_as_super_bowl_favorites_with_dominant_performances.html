        <p>The Detroit Lions are Super Bowl favorites again after a dominant performance against the Vikings, according to the latest Super Bowl odds. By Jeremy Reisman @DetroitOnLion Jan 6, 2025, 8:45am EST 
The Detroit Lions are Super Bowl favorites again after a dominant performance against the Vikings, according to the latest Super Bowl odds. Now that the NFL playoff field is set, all eyes are on Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans. Fourteen teams still have their championship dreams alive, but only one will walk away with the Lombardi Trophy on  
According to the latest FPI, the Detroit Lions are the favorites to win Super Bowl LIX, with a 26.7% chance of taking home the title.. The Lions (15-2) have been arguably the most dominant team in  
With the Lions' continued dominance and Kansas City's stumble, the Lions are now the odds-on Super Bowl favorites, according to BetMGM. The Lions now have 31-to-10 odds, or +310, to win Super Bowl 59, and are listed at +120 to win the NFC. That means a $10 bet on the Lions to win the Super Bowl would pay you $31 if they win, plus your $10 back. 
Detroit, which needed to win just two home games to make the first Super Bowl in franchise history, is out. The Commanders are moving onto the NFC title game for the first time since the end of  
The Detroit Lions are once again the favorites to win Super Bowl 59.. After a dominant, exclamation point win over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18, the Lions are the favorite to win the Super  
After a dominating 52-6 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Lions have become the new favorites to win the Super Bowl, according to updated odds. Entering the game as the NFC's top team with an 8-1 record, the Lions' explosive performance on both sides of the ball was a clear statement to the rest of the NFL. 
The Lions had never been listed as Super Bowl favorites before Week 12. Before this year, Detroit had only had three seasons in the Super Bowl era with more than 10 wins: 1991, 2014, and 2023. 
The Lions are off to their best start since 1934. As of Monday afternoon, BetMGM&amp;#039;s Super Bowl 59 odds have Detroit at +310. As of Monday afternoon, BetMGM's Super Bowl 59 odds have Detroit at  
DETROIT – For the first time in the history of the franchise, the Detroit Lions are the official favorites to win the Super Bowl. It’s incredible what a great front office and coaching staff  
With the Lions' continued dominance and Kansas City's stumble, the Lions are now the odds-on Super Bowl favorites, according to BetMGM. The Lions now have 31-to-10 odds, or +310, to win Super Bowl 59, and are listed at +120 to win the NFC. That means a $10 bet on the Lions to win the Super Bowl would pay you $31 if they win, plus your $10 back. 
The Lions have been left out of the Super Bowl party for over 66 years. Detroit has long awaited the return of a top football team, and the 2024 Lions are just that. This team has so many things that it does so well that it has become incredibly hard not to consider them a Super Bowl favorite. Detroit has arguably the best offense in the entire  
The Detroit Lions are the new Super Bowl favourite at +420. All things considered; it makes sense that Detroit would be the frontrunner to win it all at FanDuel this morning. 
NFL Wild Card Weekend has officially wrapped up, and what a series of games it was! Six teams have bowed out of the Super Bowl race, leaving us with an intense field heading into 
Until this week, the Chiefs have been the undisputed favorites all season. Last week, they sat atop the odds board at +400 to win it all.The Detroit Lions trailed slightly at +450, with the Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers lined up behind. 
Depending on the status of 49ers tackle Trent Williams, my Lions vs. 49ers prediction is the Total Over 51.5 Points (-110). However, if Williams fails to play for San Francisco, my prediction shifts to the Lions Team Total Over. In either case, bettors should expect a dominant performance from the Lions offense. 
The Detroit Lions play the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving, and are Super Bowl favorites. Craig Carton, Danny Parkins, and Mark Schlereth discuss the expectations on the Lions and if anything short  
The Detroit Lions emerged as one of the most dominant teams in NFL history through the early portion of the 2024 season.. The Lions were built with All-Pro talent in the trenches and a collection  
The wait begins for the Detroit Lions.. The Lions clinched the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs after pulling away to handle the Minnesota Vikings 31-9 on Sunday night.With the win, the Lions finished 15-2 and atop the NFC standings to earn a first-round bye and homefield advantage until Super Bowl 2025. </p>
