Introduction ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ I decided to write up this guide on Tecmo Super Bowl attributes because I felt it was a long-needed guide both on GameFAQs and on the internet in general. Unlike games like Madden or NFL 2K, the meaning behind the attributes of players in Tecmo aren't spelled out and obvious. 
2. Running Speed. Rushing Power in the SNES is what Running Speed is in the NES. With that point a 31 Rushing power player is equivalent to a 44 Running Speed player in the NES. This is another reason beyond the raw player ratings why running/juking is harder in this version. The average defender has LT level running speed.

The Man Pt value that is listed is a rating score created by the NFTGL. It is based on research online about what each attribute does and its overall value to the player. As a ranking system, it's solid. It might not be 100% accurate based on player preference, but it's good enough. Each position page is sorted from best to worst in the game.

This felt like the appropriate graphic to use considering the Bills were “on the cusp” when Tecmo Bowl was released in 1989, and well into their run when Tecmo Super Bowl was released in 1991. Having said that , this is about “QB Bills” aka Jim Kelly, who had a pretty high rating and a slew of weapons, but also sported a disturbingly

I do that too, cornerback HP in the 25-50 range. It makes for useful slow low-INT high-HP run stopping safeties, like real life Andre Waters. But yeah, the big issue is OG RP. I prefer using a low RP rating for all players except wide receivers and cornerbacks (they get a low RS instead), and I find it to be a bit more 
I have only played the original Tecmo Super Bowl game. Is III based off the '94 players with the '95 team schedule?

Tecmo Super Bowl is a high quality game that works in all major modern web browsers. This online game is part of the Arcade, Sports, Emulator, and NES gaming categories. Tecmo Super Bowl has 30 likes from 35 user ratings. If you enjoy this game then also play games Tecmo Super NBA Basketball and Tecmo NBA Basketball.
