        <p>Find out how likely people of different age groups are to watch Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024, according to a survey by Statista. The share of respondents who plan to watch the game is highest among 30 to 44-year-olds. 
Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). 
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76]

The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
Last year, there was little variance between age cohorts in terms of likelihood to watch the Super Bowl. This year, however, adults ages 18-34 (75 percent) and adults ages 35-44 (70 percent) are more likely than adults ages 45-64 (63 percent) and adults ages 65 and older (62 percent) to say they plan to watch the game. 
In the 18-34 age demographic, Nielsen estimated that last year’s Super Bowl OOH viewership was 38 percent, a figure that was 13 percentage points higher than regular-season viewership for that  
Super Bowl viewership has fluctuated over the years but increased by about 26% from 2021 to 2024, while the U.S. resident population increased steadily year over year. Interestingly the trends in annual percentage change in Super Bowl viewership and annual U.S. population change are similar, though there may not be a direct correlation. 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four

No matter which data you look at, Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched Big Game in history. Nielsen, long considered the predominant measure of live TV viewing, reported Super Bowl 2024 reached

In an interview with Ad Age about the Super Bowl,  The Super Bowl reached 123 million viewers in the U.S. in 2024, and popular commercials have been known to inundate brands’ sites. 
Football’s average age of its viewers was at 50. That’s better. It’s still not the NBA (42) or soccer (39). A 1.5-year median age jump in one year for the Super Bowl should be a slight concern. After all, just staying at the same rate should make the average median age 48.7. No league wants to be associated with an aging fanbase. 
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals

In particular, women aged 18–24 exhibited a 24% surge in year-over-year Super Bowl viewership. 
While the Super Bowl has managed to remain the most-watched live event of the year, it has not managed to maintain its robust viewership numbers in the age of cord-cutting and media saturation. Despite the trend of lower viewership, there is one instance that raises audience interest, but it remains outside of the NFL’s direct control: too  </p>
