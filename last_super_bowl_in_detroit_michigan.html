        <p>There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season.

The Lions won three pre-Super Bowl NFL titles in the 1950s with Hall of Fame QB Bobby Layne under center, the last in 1957. They haven't been to a title game since and some blame Layne for cursing the team when he was traded from the team in 1958.

The Detroit Lions’ last Super Bowl appearance was on January 5, 1992, during Super Bowl XXVI. The game was held at the Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota, against the Washington Redskins.

They also have never played in the Super Bowl. Since 1970, Detroit has only appeared in the NFC Championship Game twice.
