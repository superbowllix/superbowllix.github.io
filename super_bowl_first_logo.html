        <p>The logo was the first of its kind, as no other Super Bowl had involved the Lombardi Trophy in its design. And for the next 10 years, that – like just about everything else – would not change.

The logo was the first of its kind, as no other Super Bowl had involved the Lombardi Trophy in its design. And for the next 10 years, that – like just about everything else – would not change. 
The first Super Bowl to be held post the AFL-NFL merger, the 1971 Super Bowl logo had another unique design, but one that had some resemblance to the earlier designs, if only through color combinations. Going for a unique, yet highly aesthetic design of line art, the resultant logo looked to be made in the style of neon signs. 
Super Bowl XXXIX’s logo prominently featured the Dames Point Bridge, an iconic structure in Jacksonville, Fla. These logos continued until 2010, when the NFL shifted its design philosophy again. 
Super Bowl Logo 2021. The Super Bowl 2021 logo resembles the 2020 emblem because it uses two accent colors. However, while the Roman numerals previously emitted a warm yellow glow, they now evoke a sense of coldness due to the blue gradient. The gradient shift appears dynamic thanks to the contrast between the light top and the dark bottom. 
The first major change to the Super Bowl logo began in 1987 for Super Bowl XXI between the New York Giants and Denver Broncos. That game was held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California and the  
This year was the first to feature the newly designed Super Bowl logo with images of the game stadium. Read more: Super Bowl tickets are currently going for upwards of $35,000 on Ticketmaster 
From 1983 to 1993, the Super Bowl logo took on only three constants: The Roman numerals, the “Super Bowl” name and a patriotic trio of red, white and blue. Each logo had its own outline and character, something that separated it from the year before and the year to come, with the notable exception of a fresh color palette. 
In the first 10 or so years of the Super Bowl, the focus of the logo was on those two words. They were printed large–stacked like a newspaper headline–or long, like a banner, followed by a

The first Super Bowl did not have a logo, but each championship game since then has featured one. Super Bowl 2 through Super Bowl 44 (1968-2010) featured a logo that often included a nod to the  
The 2025 Super Bowl logo reflects the character of New Orleans, chosen as the match’s host city. The design conveys the city’s festive atmosphere, known for its lively festivals and unique Mardi Gras Indian traditions. 
For the first time ever, the NFL collaborated with a local artist on the creation of a Super Bowl logo. The artist who created our new logo, Tahj Williams, is the queen of her Black Masking Indian  
That said, what makes Super Bowl LIX's logo special is that for the first time, the NFL worked with a local artist to design the logo for the Big Game. 'Queen' Tahj Williams created the logo for this year's iteration of the Super Bowl using traditional beading techniques, preserving the Black Masking tradition. 
Super Bowl LIX will feature a logo created by a local New Orleans artist, a first for the NFL, and how that affects how much Super Bowl merchandise is set to go for during the Big Game 
“I come from a great and beautiful culture, and I want the world to see it the same way as I do,” said Williams, 26, who is the first person to handcraft both the Super Bowl logo and theme art. 
This marks the first time the NFL has collaborated with a local artist to design a Super Bowl logo, a decision that celebrates New Orleans’ artistic and cultural contributions. By incorporating local traditions, the logo serves as both a tribute to the city and a visual representation of the NFL’s appreciation for its host communities. 
NEW ORLEANS — History is being made at Super Bowl LIX as New Orleans artist Tahj “Queen Tahj” Williams becomes the first Black woman to design the official logo and theme art for the NFL’s biggest game. </p>
