Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over. New scene. Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment. George: The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl. Jerry: I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back. 
‘The Label Maker’ Season 6, Episode 12 - Aired January 19, 1995 . After Jerry gives Superbowl tickets to Tim Whatley (Bryan Cranston), the dentist "regifts" a label maker that Elaine gave him. 
There’s heavy Super Bowl chatter throughout the “Seinfeld” episode, “The Label Maker.”  A Super Bowl ticket dilemma is also prominent in the Season 5 “Everybody Loves Raymond  
Jerry’s story – Jerry has to give away his Super Bowl tickets due to the Drake having his wedding the same day. He eventually gives them to Tim Whatley. He learns soon after that the Drake’s wedding is off, and is thinking of degifting the tickets, since Whatley was guilty of regifting the label baby.

Jerry and Newman eventually get to go to the Super Bowl. But in the initial DeGifting ReGifting scandal, Dr. Whatley is the true owner of the Super Bowl tickets. Next year though, Jerry could have saved everybody some time and just delivered the ticket directly to NEWMAN! 
Yet another episode of wonderful timing. It involves two gifts. A pair of Super Bowl tickets and a label maker. In the middle of it all is that dentist played by Brian Cranston. Those tickets get passed around from character to character while Elaine obsesses over the regifting of a label maker. 
The Season 5 episode simply titled "Super Bowl" is the perfect example of Ray's hectic life when he receives two tickets to the Super Bowl and chooses to take a friend instead of his wife, father
