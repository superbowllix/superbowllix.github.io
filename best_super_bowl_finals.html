Top 10 Best Super Bowls of All-Time The Super Bowl is more than just a game; it’s a spectacle where heroes are made and legacies are written.

Peyton Manning’s final Super Bowl appearance as a member of the Colts started off strong. Indianapolis jumped to a 10-0 lead, and were still ahead when the fourth quarter began. However, Super Bowl XLIV would be defined by a pair of big plays from the Saints. The first came during the second half kickoff when the Saints recovered an onside kick. 
While the ending was a bit anticlimactic, this was one of the best fourth quarters in Super Bowl history, as a record 37 points were scored during the game's final 15 minutes. 10. Super Bowl XXXII  
The Pats' coronation as Super Bowl champs was supposed to be a formality, the capstone of their season-long revenge tour after Spygate, and the final piece of a 19-0 season that would go down as  
5) Super Bowl XXXIV (Rams 23, Titans 16) This game is famous for its final play.. The Tennessee Titans rallied from a 16-0 deficit to tie the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV, but Kurt Warner and Isaac Bruce connected on a 73-yard TD to give St. Louis a seven-point lead with under two minutes to play. 
For them, the Super Bowl was played weeks ago when they defeated the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers were the undisputed best team on planet Earth and it showed. When the dust settled, San Francisco won 49-26 and had scored 42 points through three quarters.

Best &amp; Worst Numbers for Super Bowl Squares The most desired numbers are: 0,1, 3, 4, 7. As we know, field goals are worth three points, touchdowns are worth six and point after attempts are worth one. 
As I detailed in my New Orleans Super Bowl history piece, The Big Easy has hosted seven indoor Super Bowls, and each one has finished with a final score of 37, 56, or 65. 
If you’re looking to cash a bet before Super Bowl 59 even begins, then betting on the National Anthem length may be the one for you. Betting on whether the National Anthem will go over a set number of seconds has grown in popularity in recent years, and this year won’t be any different. 
The Chiefs are -1.5 betting favorites over the Eagles in the Super Bowl odds.So it comes as no surprise that a final score of Chiefs 27, Eagles 24 is the most likely scenario.
