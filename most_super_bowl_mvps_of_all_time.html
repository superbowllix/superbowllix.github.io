The Super Bowl MVP voting system is a bit complex. The MVP is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel’s ballots count for 80% of the vote tally, while the viewers’ ballots make up the other 20%.

Montana’s MVPs came in Super Bowl XVI against the Cincinnati Bengals, Super Bowl XIX against the Miami Dolphins and Super Bowl XXIV against the Denver Broncos.
