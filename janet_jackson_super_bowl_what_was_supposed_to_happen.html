        <p>Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple  
It was Timberlake, after all, who along with Janet Jackson at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show gave birth to the phrase “wardrobe malfunction’’ and together were embroiled in “Nipplegate 
These pictures were obviously fabricated from screen shots of the 2003 Super Bowl halftime show — given the crush of media attention resulting from one partially-exposed breast at the 2004 Super  
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake's 2004 Super Bowl "wardrobe malfunction" is the subject of a new documentary. Learn what really went down and what Jackson and Timberlake have said since. 
Even casual football fans will remember, the fiasco that was the 2004 Super Bowl Halftime Show involving popstars Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake. In a moment that will likely live on in  
But that’s exactly how FCC chairman Michael Powell described the 2004 halftime show. Specifically the portion of the show that featured Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and the wardrobe malfunction seen around the world. The show’s other acts (yes, there were other performers) Kid Rock, P. Diddy and Nelly, all escaped Powell’s ire. 
What happened with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl? A little background: Super Bowl 38 was held in Houston, Texas, in 2004.  Justin was supposed to tear Jackson's skirt off to reveal a jumpsuit  
On February 1, 2004, Janet Jackson, then 38-years-old, and Justin Timberlake, then 23-years-old, caused a wake of mass cultural hysteria when, at the end of Jackson’s Super Bowl Halftime  
Things came to a tipping point a week after the Super Bowl on the night of the 2004 Grammys, which were scheduled to air on CBS. Those airing rights meant Moonves got to decide who would and  
A singularly sensational event occurs during the halftime show of the Super Bowl on February 1, 2004. While performing a duet with Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake briefly exposed one of her  
The Super Bowl Incident Put Janet Jackson In The Headlines For The Wrong Reasons When Jackson performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004, Justin Timberlake ripped off a piece of her costume. Jackson reacted with shock and later said that while Timberlake was supposed to tear off the piece, she wasn't supposed to be exposed. 
"People don't remember this Super Bowl was an amazing performance. Janet had three costume changes and the dancers had two."  So what was supposed to happen at the end of Jackson and Timberlake  
In 2004, a planned "costume reveal" went awry during the Super Bowl halftime show. Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake's careers took different turns after the backlash to the event. 
Janet Jackson's career has never fully recovered, but she did enjoy some success post-Super Bowl XXXVIII, as well as some poetic justice in the form of an apology from Justin Timberlake, albeit  
Janet Jackson’s infamous ‘Nipplegate’ occurred 20 years ago today at the Super Bowl Halftime show on February 1, 2004 and we still owe her an apology. 
Here's a timeline of the controversy surrounding Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake's Super Bowl halftime performance that took place on Feb. 1, 2004.

Five Years Later (2009): The Conservative Era. By 2009, the Super Bowl halftime show had become a markedly safer affair. The performances featured iconic, legacy acts like Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and The Rolling Stones—artists chosen not just for their talent but for their perceived lack of controversy. 
“Malfunction: The Dressing Down of Janet Jackson" examines that infamous Super Bowl halftime performance and how it damaged Jackson’s career for years. Presented by the New York Times and FX, the film is part of the same series that detailed Britney Spears’ life under her conservatorship.
