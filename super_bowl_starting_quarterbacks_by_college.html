Since the start of the Super Bowl era in 1966, quarterbacks from the Pac-12 have won a total of 12 Super Bowls. The conference’s most successful NFL quarterback is Peyton Manning, who won two Super Bowls with the Indianapolis Colts and was named MVP in both games. Other notable Pac-12 quarterbacks include John Elway, Troy Aikman and Matt Leinart. 
The influence of a college is equally variant. However, to answer your specific question, the college that has produced the most Super Bowl starting quarterbacks is the University of Alabama followed by Purdue University. University of Alabama has traditionally been known for its strong football program.

Former Boston College Eagles quarterback Matt Ryan didn't just appear on a Super Bowl roster; he led the Atlanta Falcons to 2017's Super Bowl LI. SLIDE 19 of 50 32 (TIE).

Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
In 1964, Joe Namath was the first football quarterback to win both a Super Bowl and college championship when his Jets beat the Colts in Super Bowl III, as Jetswire reports. Joe Montana matched the feat about 13 years later when he won four Super Bowls with the Niners. He won the college championship with Notre Dame in 1977. 
Joe Theismann is the only other former Notre Dame quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl, leading the Washington Redskins to a 27-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the 17th big game. 
Out of the 36 starting quarterbacks who lost their Super Bowl debuts, the only ones to end up on the victory stage as a starter are Kansas City’s Len Dawson, who lost Super Bowl 1 and then won it three years later, and Miami’s Bob Griese, who followed a loss in Super Bowl 6 with a win the following year.

Louisiana Tech (Terry Bradshaw and Luke McCown) and Stanford University (Jim Plunket, John Elway) have also produced multiple Super Bowl quarterbacks. However, worth noting that there's no guaranteed route to making it to the Super Bowl, regardless of where you go to college. </p>
