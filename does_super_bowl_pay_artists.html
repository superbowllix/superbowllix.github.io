The Super Bowl halftime show, despite hosting some of the world's biggest stars and attracting massive audiences, does not pay its performers. However, there's a specific reason for it.

The NFL may cover travel costs for artists, but maintains its long-standing tradition of not paying performers for the pregame and halftime shows beyond the minimum union scale requirements. 
TIL NFL does not pay its superbowl halftime performers citing high volume exposure. In fact it expects artists to share revenue from their post Superbowl tours. 
For artists, performing at the Super Bowl halftime show is a once-in-a-lifetime marketing opportunity. Invest in real estate without the headache of being a landlord Imagine owning a portfolio of thousands of well-managed single family rentals or a collection of cutting-edge industrial warehouses. 
Although the NFL does not pay artists, it does foot the bill for the elaborate production, which costs up to $10 million, as reported by Forbes.
