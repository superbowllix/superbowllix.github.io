It remains popular among Pittsburghers despite being updated due to the departure of several of the players mentioned in the original lyrics and the fact that the Steelers no longer need to win "that one for the thumb" after having won Super Bowl XL. The song was updated following a 2006 online vote conducted by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
The song‚Äôs basic structure has remained the same since it was first introduced in 1994, but some sayings ‚Äî like the iconic ‚Äúthis is the year we‚Äôll get that one for thumb‚Äù line, have changed as the Steelers have gone from four to five to six Super Bowl titles. The Steelers have a long history of musical associations. 
On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27‚Äì23 against the Arizona Cardinals. [46] At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first). [47]
