Jackson wasn’t just a participant in either sport, he was one of the best at both simultaneously. Bo was the first professional athlete to be an all-star in two sports at the same time. Despite this incredible success, he had never been able to make it to either the World Series or the Super Bowl. 
Even without winning a Super Bowl or World Series, Bo will forever be known as a cultural icon and one of the most famous athletes of all time.

14 seasons in the NFL with 2 Super Bowl Championships, played in MLB for 9 seasons and went to a World Series. His first 9 seasons of both sports over lapped. He’s the only professional athlete to ever hit a home run and score a touchdown in the same week. WTF!
