        <p>Super Bowl LVII is just around the corner, and we know that Reddit is getting ready to celebrate. In honor of this year’s Super Bowl, we’ve partnered with none other than the NFL to create a set of limited-edition Super Bowl LVII Collectible Avatars.

High scoring shoot-out esque game, great game by both QBs (minus the one fumble), Hurts put up a historic rushing performance at QB, Toney punt return was awesome.

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) scores a touchdown against the Philadelphia Eagles during the first quarter in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on Feb. 12, 2023. 
Will Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs become the first team ever to win three consecutive Super Bowls? Can Nick Sirianni's Philadelphia Eagles flip the script from SB LVII and

Ahead of Super Bowl LVII Feb. 12, Reddit released a series of free, limited-edition Super Bowl LVII Collectible Avatars for users to collect. Four avatars are available to choose from, but each  
L-R: Patrick Mahomes, President Joe Biden and Travis Kelce at the White House for an event honoring the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl LVII win on June 5, 2023. 
Super Bowl LIX is a few days away and there's plenty of speculation about how this championship matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will play out. After all, history is  
Brave take. No but seriously, people say this all the time but the Chiefs are the ones who had a TD called back in both games. If the refs wanted to rig the game for the chiefs, they they could’ve made their job a lot easier by not calling back the Pacheco TD last week on a hold.

I’ll take any excuse to talk about Phish on PH - on NYE 2019 they did a stunt where the 4 band members played an entire set on raised platforms with ropes but the frontman’s platform didn’t descend so he was stuck up there prob 50 feet above the stage until the end of the show and they had to use another platform to rescue him.
