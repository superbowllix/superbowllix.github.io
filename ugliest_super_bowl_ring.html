A lot of the early Super Bowl rings (Chiefs, Packers &amp; Jets), look like Class Graduation Rings, but I think that has more to do with the style at the time. They're not "ugly", just a little too modest, for my taste. Though, the red in the Chiefs one is straight up fire-flames awesome. 
With the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, NBC Sports Bay Area talked to Rick Harrison from the famous History Channel show about the ugliest ring in Super Bowl history. “The Steelers won a Super bowl ring and they had Roethlisberger helped design the ring, it’s probably the ugliest one,” Harrison said laughing.

By the end of this beautiful Super Bowl Sunday, either the Kansas City Chiefs or the San Francisco 49ers are going to be sporting new Super Bowl rings sometime next year. From the plain, original ring the Packers received after winning Super Bowl I to the rings covered in diamonds that we see teams commission today, every single ring has  
The one I think is the ugliest is the 08 Steelers ring. I understand that after 6 super bowls it is difficult to represent them all on one ring, but it looks like  
Pawn Stars host Rick Harrison believes Ben Roethlisberger designed the ugliest Super Bowl ring. “If you play football, stick to that. Find out what you’re not good at in this world and don’t do that.” 
The rings have an economic impact and create jobs: The production of Super Bowl rings by Jostens at its Denton County, Texas, facility generates $2.1 million in economic output locally, $1.4  
XXVI I really like. Also a funny somewhat unrelated story about the 85 bears rings, I don’t remember it well but pretty much the league gave them 10,000 dollars to put into the rings but the owners could put more money into them if they wanted, when they were giving the rings out there were pretty high expectations because of the way the 49ers got their rings for super bowl 19 but instead

To the victors, go the spoils. For members of a Super Bowl winning organization, those come in the form of a Super Bowl ring. Last year’s Super Bowl rings for the New England Patriots, manufactured by Jostens, were made of white gold and featured 205 diamonds totaling 4.85 carats. The cost? Reportedly $36,500 each.

It was every super bowl ring to that point, laid out in chronological order. It was probably the best visual display of power creep and blooming excess you’ll ever see. Looking at the rings in photos , you might get an abstract idea of the excess, the detail of the diamonds, etc, but to see them laid out with your own eyesit’s surreal. 
Not for all the rings, but for each Super Bowl ring. The NFL puts $5,000 toward each ring for the first 150 and the team finances the rest. In some cases, it may come out of a player’s salary.

The Craftsmanship and Value of a Super Bowl Ring. The Super Bowl ring is not merely a piece of jewelry; it is a work of art, crafted from yellow or rose gold and lavishly adorned with diamonds and sometimes other gems, according to Diario AS. These rings feature the team name, logo, the title “World Champions,” and the Super Bowl’s  
I never realized a diamond ring could be ugly until I started paying close attention to the details of the Neil Lane rings contestants get. I remember a comment here saying how ugly Jillian’s ring was, thinking “that’s pretentious. how can a diamond be ugly?”, googling it, and literally recoiling because that ring is so hideous. </p>
