        <h2><strong>average super bowl over under has kendrick lamar played super bowl before</strong></h2>
        <p>Taking out two pushes and one pick ’em game, favorites are 28-27 (51%) in the game against the spread. The over/under is split exactly down the middle with 29 games going over the total and 29 staying under (Super Bowl I had no over/under odds posted, but one would have to assume it would have gone over with 45 points scored). 
Highest Total (Over/Under): The highest total (over/under) in the Super Bowl was 58.5 points in Super Bowl 58.5, when the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34-28 in overtime. Lowest Total (Over/Under): 33 is the lowest total posted for the Super Bowl and it has happened four times: XXXV: Giants vs Ravens 
The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
For OVER/UNDER bets, a total point threshold is set, such as the 49.5 total point mark for Super Bowl LIX. Bettors predict whether the combined score of both teams will be OVER or UNDER this number. The UNDER has hit in five of the last six Super Bowls. 
This year’s Super Bowl will be a rematch of Super Bowl 54 back in February 2020, when the Kansas City Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers. As you can see, the Chiefs were narrow favorites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, and this time, the Niners are favored by just about the same margin, with the spread sitting at -1.5 in their favor. 
The largest point spread in Super Bowl history was in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995. The San Francisco 49ers entered the game as massive 18.5-point favorites over the San Diego Chargers. 
Favorites are 28-28-2 in the 58 Super Bowls that have been contested. The UNDER is 29-28 in Super Bowl betting history. There was no total posted for Super Bowl 1. This year's Big Game will be a  
Here's a look at the past Super Bowl Over/Under history: Super Bowl LVI: Under (49.5 – Rams 23, Bengals 20) Super Bowl LV: Under (56 – Buccaneers 31, Chiefs 9) Super Bowl LIV: Under (53  
The ‘over/under’ has gone 29-28 in the first 58 Super Bowl matchups. No total was posted on Super Bowl I between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. In the 2019 Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. 
The longest Over streak was 4, from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXIII The team that has scored first has won 38 of 58 Super Bowls (65.5%) As per Steve Makinen on VSiN.com , "The team with the better record going into the Super Bowl game is 30-20 SU all-time but has lost 12 of the last 14 and is on a 1-16 ATS skid since 2004!"

Super Bowl 57 Over/Under: Picks for betting the Chiefs-Eagles total  Still, we're looking at two teams with a combined first-half scoring average of 33.7. That's 9.2 points over the first-half  
The over/under for the length of Batiste's rendition is 120.5 second, or 2:00.50, an ode to Batiste's wide-ranging musical talents and recent trends.  the average national anthem has lasted  
* Concerning Super Bowl totals, in the 57 games that had posted numbers, Over is 39-18 (68.4%) and Under is 38-18-1 (67.9%) on 6-point teasers. For the 2024 game, both Over and Under teaser bettors won handily. 
Jon Batiste will be performing the national anthem at Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans. FanDuel sportsbook opened the over/under on the length of Batiste’s national anthem at 120.5 seconds, or two minutes and 0.5 seconds. 
Matt Severance has revealed his 2025 Super Bowl expert picks and NFL predictions for Kansas City vs. Philadelphia  while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5.  he carried 200 times  
The average length of the Super Bowl national anthem since 191 is 115.6 seconds (1 minute and 55.6 seconds). How long was the national anthem at the last Super Bowl? 
The Kansas City Chiefs won against the San Francisco 49ers, 25 to 22, in Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024. 
It is undeniable that McEntire's history singing the national anthem suggests that under 90 seconds is a wise bet. But, I contend that a performance at the Super Bowl is not comparable to a performance at a 1974 Oklahoma City Rodeo Championship, nor even comparable to the 1985 World Series. The Super Bowl is an event — a spectacle, even. 
Therefore, the average Super Bowl total points in 56 Super Bowl games is 46 points. Overall, the Over has hit in 27 Super Bowls, while the Under has cashed in 28 games 4 . If the Chiefs and Eagles go Over, we will be even at 28 going into Super Bowl 58. </p>
