        <p>Jesus Washed Feet Super Bowl Commercial or Jesus Washed Feet Super Bowl Ad refers to an advertisement aired by the Christian organization He Gets Us on February 11th, 2024, during Super Bowl LVIII. The ad's message sparked controversy in religiously minded circles as posters argued over its interpretation of Christ's message, while also  
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Foot Washing,” the 60-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” 
For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” Two commercials shown Sunday night centered Jesus’ message to love your neighbors  
First-timer Instacart joins DoorDash and Uber Eats and a battle between food delivery services during the game. Instacart loads up its ad with tons of brand characters it hopes viewers recognize: from Mountain Dew’s “PuppyMonkeyBaby” character from a 2016 Super Bowl ad to the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. 
The ad will explore “how Jesus redefined true greatness.” Lerma, the lead creative agency behind He Gets Us’ previous Super Bowl spots, created the 2025 ad as well. 
A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines. 
A California church created a humorous Doritos ad that aired in 2010 after winning the snack brand’s Super Bowl ad contest. On Sunday, one “He Gets Us” ad will be shown during each half. One will focus on how children demonstrate Jesus’ love, while the other deals with anger, and how Jesus modeled a different way. 
In between star-studded advertisements and a whole lot of football, this year’s Super Bowl watchers are being taken to church. “He Gets Us,” a campaign to promote Jesus and Christianity, is  
Most Super Bowl adverts plug things like fizzy drink and cars, but one of the most talked-about commercials the day after the big game was selling Jesus - and it upset several very different  
It’s becoming a Super Bowl tradition: He Gets Us, the billion-dollar effort to overhaul the public image of Jesus, the Son of God, will be back on the airwaves during Super Bowl LIX. Greg Miller  
He Gets Us, a $100 million campaign reimagining Jesus’ message, is airing a 60-second “True Greatness” spot at Super Bowl 2025. Learn how the nonprofit Come Near, Jon Batiste’s Love Riot Festival, and AI-driven art are shaping this year’s faith-based outreach. 
As the final countdown to Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, begins, it’s clear that Matthew McConaughey stars in Uber Eats Super Bowl Ad 2025 with a mission: to tickle our funny bones while encouraging us to get even hungrier—and, of course, order from the Uber Eats app when cravings strike. 
I thought the commercials were by and large exceptionally good this year. Beer, chips, soda, Ram, avocados, Amazon even the Jesus commercials were attention getting (then they were spoiled by being commercials for "Jesus") Movie trailers weren't bad. The only one I remember thinking was totally awful was whatever the hell meta was trying do. 
By enlisting the universally recognized Eugene Levy for the Little Caesars Super Bowl 2025 commercial, the brand underscores its commitment to bold storytelling that goes beyond the typical “pizza ad.” Levy’s comedic pedigree ensures that the product reveal—centered on the “Whoa!” reaction to Bacon &amp; Cheese Crazy Puffs—will  
Are you looking for a Super Bowl prop bet sheet for 59? We’re here to help with TSG’s free printable version of the popular game. We’ve included all sorts of cool prop bets for the game between the Chiefs and the Eagles, including some fool options that revolve around Kendrick Lamar’s halftime performance, commercials, and more! 
There is no better opportunity for advertisers than the Super Bowl, which is watched by an average of more than 100 million Americans each year. Naturally, the price of running a commercial during  
I put together 10 commercials from the 2024 Super Bowl which I think are the best and that actually aired during the Big Game. I hope you enjoy my compilatio

Apparently, this commercial tested well, but once it aired to thousands of drunk people at Super Bowl parties, bookended by funny and raunchy commercials, it fell apart. “Shower” (GoDaddy, 2009) 
No. The approach they are taking is about proselytizing vulnerable people into their kind of religion by false pretenses. "Liberal" churches don't have much outreach capabilities, or presence in communities compared to happy-clappy Protestant Fundagelical Bible churches. I can imagine the intention is to get people to reconsid </p>
