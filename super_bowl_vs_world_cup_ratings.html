The FIFA World Cup Final in 2018, which featured young phenom Kylian Mbappe and France defeating Croatia by a thrilling score of 4-2, had 3.57 billion viewers, per FIFA. For comparison, the 2022  
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
How does attendance data compare in the World Cup vs. Super Bowl? SoFi Stadium’s capacity is over 70,000, which adds up to the sold-out Super Bowl LVI attendance of 70,240 . 
FIFA World Cup Final Beat Super Bowl LVI By More Than One BILLION Viewers In TV Ratings / FIFA has claimed that around 1.5 billion people watched the 2022 World Cup final live on television.
