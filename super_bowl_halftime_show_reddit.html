        <p>Fair perspective! I think I, along with the majority of America, loved last year’s show - but totally understand appreciating a more simple quality show. I think back to shows like prince, Beyoncé, MJ - def can carry on their own. But then when I think of maroon 5 and black eyed peas def def needed the guests to make it bearable lol.

That and playing at the Superbowl Halftime show doesn't actually pay all that much. The NFL doesn't pay the performers much. That and I know some artists have pur some kf their own money into the show to make it how they want to make it since the NFL doesn't invest too much into it these days. 
Check out the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, it was truly awesome IMO. hell even Justin Timberlake last year did it way better than this one. Reply reply More replies Doitchebag 
Answer: I guess it depends on what you consider appropriate and inappropriate for the Super Bowl halftime show. There was belly dancing and pole dancing. The costumes allowed for full range of motion. I’m sure you can find lots of clips of the show on the internet.

It makes me so sad, at his best Kanye was a symbol of hope and the ability to fight mental illness and create meaning. The fact that he has seemingly failed and completely gone off the deep end just takes that away from me - it’s hard to feel inspiration or comfort in his music anymore.

Diana Ross was considered a safe choice for Super Bowl XXX, but only a diva of her magnitude could pull off such a shocking performance. It starts off with her descending from the sky on a sparking platform, slowing considerably through a medley of her biggest hits, like “Baby Love” and “Stop in the Name of Love” with tuxedo-clad dancers all around her. 
Generation X was born, by broadest definition, between 1961 and 1981, the greatest anti-child cycle in modern history. Nevertheless, we grew up to become the world's most devoted parents: the "workhorse of America." 
There’s a certain age divide, where people either loved this half time show, or hated it. Reddit is kind of split right down the middle on these ages, so I have a feeling it will be a lot of “best halftime ever” and “meh”. Lol 
I was working at a restaurant during the Super Bowl that year and I remember the game was on in the managers office so people could just filter in and out and kind of keep tabs on what was going on. But when that halftime show started I think every employee in that building was jammed into that office just watching it unfold in awe. </p>
