Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The Patriots took the then-quickest lead in Super Bowl history after linebacker Larry McGrew recovered a fumble by running back Walter Payton at the Bears 19-yard line on the second play of the game [18] (the Bears themselves would break this record in Super Bowl XLI when Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff for a touchdown).

The Bears won 46-10 to win Super Bowl XX, finishing their championship season with a record of 15-1-0 in the regular season, 3-0 in the playoffs. The Patriots finished their season 11-5-0 in the regular season, 3-1 in the playoffs. Richard Dent was voted as the Super Bowl MVP, the first Super Bowl MVP of his career. 
On Sunday, New England looked like the team supporting its rookie quarterback best. Third-overall pick Drake Maye was up-and-down. His brightest moments were during the best 7:17 of football the Patriots have played all season. 
Furthermore, we have to discuss old nemesis Doug Pederson. The Jaguars head coach and offensive coordinator Press Taylor are running Frank Reich's system, the same system that the Eagles offense ran during the 2017 season when they beat the Patriots in Super Bowl 52. Based on the tape, the Jags ability to hurt the Pats with repeat plays is twofold.

The Patriots defense has missed Dugger's physicality, particularly in the run game. Although his replacements have done some good things, defensive coordinator DeMarcus Covington told reporters that the Pats defensive backs need to do a better job of providing a more sturdy run force when offenses run to the outside. 
The Bears’ 46-10 win was the most lopsided Super Bowl to that point (it has since been surpassed by the San Francisco 49ers’ 55-10 victory over the Denver Broncos in 1989). </p>
