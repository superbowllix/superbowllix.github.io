        <p>On January 20 in the NFC Championship, Harbaugh led the 49ers to a 28–24 win over the Atlanta Falcons, which sent the 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII, and on February 3, Harbaugh faced his older brother John and the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl. 
San Francisco’s next Super Bowl appearance would not come until 2012. Of course, Jim Harbaugh was the club’s head coach, and in his second year on the 49ers’ sidelines. 
However, Harbaugh burst onto the scene with a 13-3 record, securing San Francisco its first playoff bid since 2002. The 49ers went 2-1 in the playoffs, losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants. For his efforts, Harbaugh earned Coach of the Year honors. 
In the NFC title game, the 49ers beat the Falcons in Atlanta after coming back from down 17, winning by a score of 28-24, marking the only time that Harbaugh made it to the Super Bowl. 
They may also know Harbaugh from his days as coach of the San Francisco 49ers and meeting his brother, Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh, in Super Bowl XLVII. However, unless those fans are really knowledgeable, they may not know that Harbaugh played quarterback at the University of Michigan. 
The San Francisco 49ers' run to Super Bowl XLVII will forever be remembered as the season when Jim Harbaugh made one of the gutsiest coaching calls ever by replacing Alex Smith with Colin

After Monday’s semifinal victory over Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Jack Harbaugh and his wife Jackie — the parents of Jim, John and Joani — did an exuberant, endearing interview for WXYZ, a TV station in Detroit. Jack said at a key moment in the game, he and Jackie superstitiously traded seats. 
When Jacoby Jones returned the opening kickoff of the second half 108 yards for a touchdown, the "Harbaugh Bowl" — between John's Baltimore Ravens and Jim's San Francisco 49ers — was in danger

EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — Jim Harbaugh thought there would be many more chances to face his older brother after John Harbaugh’s Baltimore Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 47. It ended up taking nearly 12 years for it to happen. “Walking off the field at that Super Bowl was like, there will be another day. 
According to Jim, he couldn't sleep after losing the Super Bowl and started channel surfing when he saw his father on TV celebrating at the Ravens' victory party. Jim said Jack was doing the twist

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Jim Harbaugh won a national championship at Michigan last month and returned to the NFL to coach the Los Angeles Chargers. He still agonizes over losing a Super Bowl with the San Francisco 49ers 11 years ago. Harbaugh is in town and will be watching closely when San Francisco faces the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. 
In 1991, Jim Harbaugh became the first Bears quarterback to start all 16 games in a decade and threw for a career-high 3,121 yards and 15 touchdowns. But he also threw 16 interceptions, a problem he faced throughout his career. 
Harbaugh led Indy to upset wins over the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs during their memorable postseason run. Harbaugh almost became the first quarterback who led the Colts to their first Super Bowl since they moved to Indianapolis in 1984. Regrettably, Indy lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game, 20-16. 
The game was dubbed the “Har-Bowl,” as it featured two brothers coaching against each other for the first time in Super Bowl history. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh and 49ers head coach Jim  </p>
