        <p>Against Denver’s top-ranked scoring defense (14.1 points per game) Montana set, at the time, a Super Bowl record for touchdowns while also earning a quarterback rating of 147.6 and completing 13  
Joe Montana’s Super Bowl QB performance in 1990 is the best of all time because his stat sheet combined both of what made Young and Simms’ games so memorable. 
The best Super Bowl performance by a quarterback we have ever seen belongs to Rodgers in his one and only appearance — and it’s not even close. Rodgers had a 94.2 passing grade in his Super Bowl 45 victory over Pittsburgh and gathered up nine big-time throws while going without a single turnover-worthy play. 
25. Terry Bradshaw, Super Bowl XIV (Steelers 31, Rams 19) 14 of 21 fo 309 yards, 2 TD, 3 INT; The only quarterback to win MVP honors with three interceptions.

Super Bowl III: New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7. Passer rating: 9.3. Passing stats: 6-for-17, 71 yards, 0 TD/3 INT. In the first game to be officially dubbed “Super Bowl” — the first two iterations were known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game and retroactively renamed — Morrall and the Colts went down to Joe Namath and the Jets in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. 
That game did not earn a spot among the top 25 performances from a quarterback in the Super Bowl, but Brady did top this list with four appearances.  that was just the second-best QB  
Here’s a look at some single-game Super Bowl passing records:. What is the record for completions in a Super Bowl? Tom Brady and Peyton Manning dominate this list. They have five of the top 10 performances in terms of completions, though there is a key difference between the two – Brady’s three appearances on the list all came in wins against the Atlanta Falcons (No. 1), Seattle Seahawks  
49ers QB Steve Young had six passing touchdowns in a 49-26 rout over the Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX. He had four touchdowns in the first half, and the game got so out of reach that 49ers backup QB Bill Musgrave played the final series of the game. 
Tom Brady proved he may be the best quarterback ever in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XLIX, leading the New England Patriots from a 10-point deficit to capture his fourth Super Bowl ring and third MVP award in the 28-24 win over the Seattle Seahawks. 
And here is a look at Mahomes' stats by Super Bowl, dating back to his first appearance in Super Bowl 54. Patrick Mahomes stats Super Bowl 54 Completion rate : 26 of 42 (61.9%) 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Considered by many as one of the most outstanding regular-season quarterbacks, Manning solidified his status among the elite by securing his second Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl 50. Retiring as a five-time MVP, Manning held NFL records for most touchdowns (539) and passing yards (71,940), although these records have since been surpassed. 
Roethlisberger was a top-five quarterback for the better part of his career, especially after his second Super Bowl triumph (following the 2008 season). I'm not going to ding him for not being  
4 players are tied for the best passer rating in a Super Bowl, with a 158.3 rating. The first three are Jauan Jennings on February 11, Antwaan Randle El on February 5, 2006 and Lawrence McCutcheon on January 20, 1980. 
TRAVIS KELCE: Chiefs TE loves being the 'villains' of the NFL What to expect from Patrick Mahomes in the 2025 Super Bowl. Mahomes and the Chiefs were able to excel against almost every opponent in
