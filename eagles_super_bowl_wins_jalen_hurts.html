Jalen Hurts flashed a rare smile when Nick Sirianni screamed on the podium after the Philadelphia Eagles won the NFC championship game: “All he does is win.” Hurts has been criticized throughout his career but numbers don’t lie and Sirianni is right.

And now let's move on, because there is so much to talk about with Hurts and his rise in Year 3 of his Eagles career.
