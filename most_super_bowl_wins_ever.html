        <p>At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL. The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) – winning the last two. 
The New England Patriots have won the Super Bowl a record six times, most recently Super Bowl LIII in February 2019. Joining them at the top of this list is the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose most  
The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers have the most Super Bowl wins in league history with six each. In second place, the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco both have five championship rings. 
No team has ever won three Super Bowls in a row, but several teams have won back-to-back titles: the Patriots, 49ers, Packers, Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos and the Steelers — who  
The Steelers had the most Super Bowl wins with six until a Patriots win in Super Bowl 53 moved Tom Brady and Co. into a tie for the most championships in NFL history. Now the 49ers have a chance  
Their first championship was a 39-20 drubbing of the Broncos on Jan. 25, 1987, with Phil Simms winning the Super Bowl MVP award. The Giants' most recent Super Bowl wins were in 2008 and 2012, when  
The New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers have won the most Super Bowls, with six wins each. The New England Patriots have made 11 Super Bowl appearances, the most of any team. The 2025 Super Bowl will be a game between between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, held in February 9th. 
The Packers won the first two Super Bowls (1966 and 1967) but had to wait 30 years for the next win, which came in Super Bowl XXXI. The team’s most recent Super Bowl victory capped off the 2010  
Tom Brady has won the most Super Bowls of any player in NFL history with seven. Brady won the 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, and 2019 Super Bowls quarterbacking the New England Patriots, and the  
Tom Brady has won the most Super Bowls of any quarterback, winning seven of his 10 Super Bowl appearances. He won the 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, and 2019 Super Bowls as the quarterback of the New England Patriots and the 2021 Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
Their first championship was a 39-20 drubbing of the Broncos on Jan. 25, 1987, with Phil Simms winning the Super Bowl MVP award. The Giants' most recent Super Bowl wins were in 2008 and 2012, when  
The New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most wins in Super Bowls, with 6 wins. 
Quarterback Tom Brady has won the most NFL championships, with seven. Tom Brady (quarterback) won Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LIII with the New England Patriots after the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2018 seasons, respectively. [1] He won Super Bowl LV with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the 2020 season. [2] 
The New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most wins in Super Bowls, with 6 wins. 
The Steelers had the most Super Bowl wins with six until a Patriots win in Super Bowl 53 moved Tom Brady and Co. into a tie for the most championships in NFL history. Now the 49ers have a chance  
This is the most impressive team that general manager Howie Roseman has built over the past decade, which is really saying something considering this is the third Super Bowl roster that Roseman  
Mike Wilson, John Stallworth and Lynn Swann are tied for the most career wins by a wide receiver in Super Bowls, with 4 wins. 
Super Bowl wins: 6 | Super Bowl Appearances: 8. The Pittsburgh Steelers are tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl wins, with 6 championships to their name. The Steelers have made 8 Super Bowl appearances, and their dominance in the 70s and 80s established them as one of the NFL's most successful franchises.
