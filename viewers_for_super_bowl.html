        <p>While viewership for prime time series and other annual events such as the Academy Awards has declined over time, viewership of the Super Bowl has remained stable. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [ 7 ] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events  
The regression model alone predicts Super Bowl viewership to be at 117.3 million for this year. However, when accounting for the Chiefs and Eagles viewership adjustment factors, that number jumps  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl

The NFL said that last year's Super Bowl drew in 62.5 million global viewers, which was a 10 percent increase from the year prior. Mexico and Canada combined for over 42 million viewers, but  
The Super Bowl proved to be a record-breaking culmination of an already historically impressive year for NFL games—matchups during the 2023 regular season drew an average of 17.9 million viewers  
The 2024 edition of the Super Bowl, which saw the Kansas City Chiefs emerge victorious against the San Francisco 49ers was watched by over 123 million viewers in the United States, making it not  
The Feb. 11 Super Bowl game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers brought in an average of 123.4 million viewers — the highest number of people watching the same broadcast  
This year, the Super Bowl will air on Fox. The biggest wild card for Super Bowl LIX is Tubi, a FAST service. With Tubi, consumers can watch the Super Bowl for free through the Tubi app or on Tubi.com. Will the ability to watch the Super Bowl for free entice more viewers? Super Bowl LIX kicks off on Sunday, Feb. 9, at 6:30 p.m. ET. 
NEW YORK – February 14, 2023 –An estimated 113.06 million viewers were tuned in for Super Bowl LVII on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The Super Bowl LVII telecast ran from 6:44 PM ET to 10:14 PM ET and averaged nearly 112.2 million viewers on FOX. 
The Super Bowl is a big event for Tubi, which is streaming the game for free: It's a chance for the service to introduce itself to a huge audience that might know little, or nothing at all, about  
Super Bowl viewers are a unique audience because they’re as primed to watch the ads as they are the game. “This is a societal moment where we come together as a country,” said Kimberly Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business.

The Super Bowl on Sunday drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers who watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in a nail-biting overtime triumph, CBS Sports said in a  
Super Bowl advertisers paid up to $8 million to secure a spot in television's most watched broadcast. Here's a lineup by product category of the commercials that will run. 
Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). 
More than 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all-or-part of Super Bowl LVIII across all networks, the highest unduplicated total audience in history and up +10% versus last year's Super Bowl (183.6 million). Univision averaged more than 2.2 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. 
Even more viewers showed up for Rihanna's performance in the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, which drew an average of 118.7 million viewers across TV and digital platforms, per FOX. </p>
