        <p>Note: Last year’s Super Bowl ads featured six EV campaigns; this year it was down to two, following a slump in the EV market. Hit: “Wicked,” the movie: It’ll be a hit, whatever its quality. 
Advertisers spent up to $7 million for every 30 seconds of airtime during Super Bowl LVII. Here's a sampling of what worked – and didn't – in the most expensive ad showcase on American television. 
NFL News: Explore the top 5 hits and misses in the commercials of Super Bowl 2024. Discover the standout ads and cringe-worthy moments from this year's Super Bowl commercial lineup. 
Note: Last year’s Super Bowl ads featured six EV campaigns; this year it was down to two, following a slump in the EV market. Hit: “Wicked,” the movie: It’ll be a hit, whatever its quality. 
Many of those ads have delivered moments that are remembered as much as the games themselves. Ahead of Super Bowl LIX (Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX), here are the 10 greatest Super Bowl commercials  
Super Bowl Ad Missteps: 1. Nationwide, 'The Boy Who Couldn't Grow Up' (Super Bowl XLIX, 2015): Nationwide's 2015 ad took an unexpected and somber turn, featuring a small boy discussing all the

Marketing expert Tony Chapman joins us with a roundup of the highs and lows of this year's Super Bowl ads. From standout triumphs like Uber Eats to the lackluster misses of M&amp;Ms and the so-so  
While many commercials during Super Bowl 58 resonated positively with audiences, a few failed to hit the mark, receiving lower ratings from the Kellogg panel. 1. Temu: During Super Bowl 58, Temu, a Chinese shopping app, aired a repetitive animated commercial multiple times, featuring people receiving low-priced items, but it drew criticism for

The news: The Super Bowl once again served as the ultimate platform for brands to present their most innovative and engaging commercials. With a steep $7 million price tag for a 30-second spot, advertisers embraced safety, nostalgia, and the undeniable allure of celebrity endorsements while subtly navigating the realms of politics and social commentary. 
Overall, this year's crop of Super Bowl ads focused on light humor that strove to entertain and connect. But that made the few ads that took a different approach stand out even more. Amazon's Michael B. Jordan ad and Cadillac's Edward Scissorhands updates were hits, while overcomplicated ads like Michelob Ultra Organic Seltzer missed the mark.

Sunday night, the Kansas City Chiefs delivered another Super Bowl championship. Ding dong! DoorDash here. Trophy’s on the porch. Don’t forget to tip your quarterback. Like Popeye’s wings  
Hefty as the fees were for advertising time on this year’s Super Bowl — up to $7 million per 30 seconds — there weren’t that many commercials whose concepts and execution seemed worthy of the price tag.
