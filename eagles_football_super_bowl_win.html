The Eagles have won just one Super Bowl during their franchise's history. That came in Super Bowl 52, which was played in 2018 as part of the 2017 NFL playoffs.

While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign.

Super Bowl MVP predictions in Super Bowl LIX. I don't think there's any question about the order in which you would assume Super Bowl MVP for this game is going to be decided: Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs; Saquon Barkley, RB, Eagles; Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles; It would take a herculean effort by anybody else in this game to be awarded Super Bowl MVP. 
Expect the Chiefs to pull out another tight Super Bowl win, this time with a 23-20 final score. GREATEST SUPER BOWL PLAYERS: Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce make cut, but so do 2 Eagles Super Bowl  
The Eagles’ journey to their Super Bowl victory is rooted in strong team-building and a commitment to excellence.
