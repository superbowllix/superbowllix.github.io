        <h2><strong>super bowl chiefs winners can you watch the super bowl in europe</strong></h2>
        <p>The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (Super Bowl I).. The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). 
The Chiefs' most recent trip to the Super Bowl was in 2025. They downed the Bills, 32-29 in the AFC championship to advance to their third-straight Super Bowl and fifth in the past six years. 
They won Super Bowl 54 against the 49ers in 2020, then lost in Super Bowl 55 to Tom Brady and the Buccaneers in 2021. After that, the Chiefs went to (and won) back-to-back Super Bowls in each of  
Below is the complete list of Chiefs Super Bowl appearances dating back to Super Bowl 1, which was played in 1967. Super Bowl 1: Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 Super Bowl 4: Kansas  
With a win, the Chiefs would join the Steelers, Patriots, 49ers and Cowboys as the only franchises that have won at least five Super Bowls. Kansas City won its fourth Super Bowl following last  
How many times have the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl? The Kansas City Chiefs have won a total of 4 Super Bowls, in 1969, 2019 and 2022-2023. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in Kansas City. 
Feb. 11, 2024: An overtime win for Kansas City — The Chiefs became the first back-to-back Super Bowl champion in two decades when they defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime at Super  
The Chiefs enter Super Bowl LVIII as the defending Super Bowl champions, having won the Super Bowl last season with a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. In Sunday’s game, they’re aiming to become the first repeat Super Bowl champions since the New England Patriots won back-to-back Lombardi Trophies in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. 
The Packers would also win Super Bowl II, and in 1970, the NFL would rename the “World Professional Football Championship Trophy” to the Vince Lombardi Trophy.  The Chiefs also appeared in  
The most recent Kansas City Chiefs win came in 2024 at Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas against the San Francisco 49ers. It was a cagey affair between the two teams and going into the fourth quarter, the 49ers held a slim 13-10 lead at the end of the third. 
Kansas City is the -123 favorite on the money line (risk $123 to win $100), while the Eagles are +104 underdogs (risk $100 to win $104).  The top 10 Chiefs vs. Eagles Super Bowl 59 parlay picks  
Expect the Chiefs to pull out another tight Super Bowl win, this time with a 23-20 final score. GREATEST SUPER BOWL PLAYERS: Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce make cut, but so do 2 Eagles Super Bowl  
Why: Another close win for the Chiefs to complete the three-peat as Chris Jones takes advantage of the Eagles' OL injuries to win Super Bowl MVP. Mike Band: Chiefs 24, Eagles 20 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will compete in Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, with kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. There have been a lot of  
Super Bowl MVP predictions in Super Bowl LIX. I don't think there's any question about the order in which you would assume Super Bowl MVP for this game is going to be decided: Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs; Saquon Barkley, RB, Eagles; Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles; It would take a herculean effort by anybody else in this game to be awarded Super Bowl MVP. 
The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will square off in the 2025 Super Bowl. Here are the latest predictions on who will win the big game. 
The Kansas City Chiefs are champions of the National Football League for the third time in franchise history after defeating the Philadelphia Eagles, 38-35, in Super Bowl LVII on Sunday night. 
Super Bowl LIX could prove to be an entertaining and close game because, according to ESPN BET, the Kansas City Chiefs are just 1.5-point favorites over the Philadelphia Eagles. In a video posted  
Super Bowl picks: Chiefs vs. Eagles predictions. Jacob Camenker, NFL writer: Chiefs 23, Eagles 20 The Chiefs vs. Eagles Super Bowl is the sequel few (outside of Kansas City and Philadelphia) wanted. 
The Kansas City Chiefs stand on the brink of history. With one more victory, they’ll become the first team in NFL history to win three straight Super Bowls. It’s a feat that would cement  </p>
