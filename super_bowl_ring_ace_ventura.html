        <p>Ace Ventura is a title character  goal against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl  and takes the ring which was indeed a missing stone to finalize his theory  
* Lois Einhorn: [the water shuts off. Einhorn appears around the corner] Alright, Ventura. Make it quick. * Ace Ventura: I found a rare stone at the bottom of Snowflake's tank. It belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC Championship ring. It would have been a Super Bowl ring, but Ray Finkle missed the big kick. Blames the whole thing on Marino. 
Ace discovered that there was one 1984 Miami player whose ring wasn't checked - ex-Dolphin mid-season replacement kicker Ray Finkle; he had lost the 1984 Super Bowl game for the Dolphins by one point, when he missed a game-winning field goal kick attempt at only 26 yards away - it ruined his career forever; Finkle's contract was not renewed and  
Ace Ventura, an eccentric and offbeat private detective in Miami, is known for rescuing tame or captive animals.Despite struggles with rent and constant mockery from the Miami Police Department, led by Lieutenant Lois Einhorn, Ventura is hired by Melissa Robinson, the Miami Dolphins' publicist, to find their kidnapped mascot, Bottlenose dolphin Snowflake, who was stolen just weeks before the  
Ace Ventura : I found a rare stone at the bottom of Snowflake's tank. It belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC Championship ring. It would have been a Super Bowl ring, but Ray Finkle missed the big kick. Blames the whole thing on Marino. 
Correction: Actually, he says it's from a 1984 AFC Championship ring. The Dolphins then went on to lose that Super Bowl because of the blown field goal. Hence, why Finkle has a ring in the first place. 
Wow. I've seen Ace Ventura probably 200 times. I never even clicked on the fact that the ring is an AFC championship ring, even though he says it. Not a super bowl ring. The whole fucking story is based on Finkle yanking the Super Bowl winning kick. What the fuck haha. 
Ace Ventura visits a Miami Dade County Police headquarters regarding the theft of a dolphin. In reality, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Comission would handle such a case. The main clue of the mystery is Ace looking for the triangle amber stone from the 1984 AFC Championship ring, except the actual ring the players received has 5  
It belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC championship ring. It would've been a Super Bowl ring, but Ray missed the kick. Blames the whole thing on Marino. We're talking paranoid, delusional psychosis. I saw the guy's room. Cozy, if you're Hannibal Lecter. So how does Roger Podacter fit in? My guess is, Finkle was snooping around. Podacter recognized him. 
Super Bowl XIX was an American football game  be seen in the movie Ace Ventura:  the first athlete to win an Olympic medal and Super Bowl ring in the  
while investigating the case and posing as an animal trainer to avoid suspicion, Ace found one key clue in the dolphin's tank filter system at the stadium - a rare triangular-cut orange amber stone; it was missing from one of the 1984 AFC Championship rings (each won by the Miami Dolphin players), the year of Super Bowl XVII ten years earlier; he surmised: "I find the ring with the missing  
Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon is upended on a scramble by the New England Patriots defense. McMahon became the first quarterback to rush for two touchdowns in a Super Bowl; he threw for 256 yards in the 46-10 rout. Super Bowl XX, Jan. 26, 1986. 
Ray Finkle, also known as "Lt. Lois Einhorn", is the main antagonist of the 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. He was the former popular kicker for the Miami Dolphins group, but was ultimately dismissed for costing the team a Super Bowl win. Finkle went completely insane, escaped from Shady Acres mental hospital, and had a sex reassignment surgery to escape the authorities. He read an  
In Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) the Super Bowl is in Miami and features the Miami Dolphins but that fact is never referenced Discussion A hosting city has never featured the home team in the Super Bowl and while the odds aren't too crazy against that happening it would be a big deal and worth making a point of. 
Remember When Ace Ventura Led Miami to a Super Bowl Win Over the Eagles? By Bob Wankel | Dec 11, 2011. Really, the Eagles and Dolphins don’t have a great history. Today’s game can’t be  
Has amazing athletic ability, handsome guy and pretty fucking rich. But I guess you can't actually have it all. Well, we knew that already because of lack of a Super Bowl ring. But you get my overall point. Marino taking a flat rate to do Ace Ventura instead of taking the points shows you how little confidence he had in it being a hit. 
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a 1994 American comedy film starring Jim Carrey as Ace Ventura, an animal detective who is tasked with finding the abducted dolphin who is the mascot of the US football team Miami Dolphins. The film was directed by Tom Shadyac, who wrote the screenplay with Carrey and Jack Bernstein. The film co-stars Courtney Cox, Tone Lōc, Sean Young, and former Miami Dolphins
