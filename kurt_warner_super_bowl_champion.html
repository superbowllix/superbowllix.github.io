Warner again led the Rams to the play-offs in 2000, but the team lost in the opening round. In 2001 Warner led the NFL in all major passing categories to earn his second MVP award, and the 14–2 Rams went into Super Bowl XXXVI as overwhelming favourites but were defeated by the 14-point underdog New England Patriots. 
Enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017, Warner would go on to lead the Rams to another Super Bowl appearance in 2001 and guided the Arizona Cardinals to their first-ever trip to the NFL's Championship Game following the 2008 season. Warner was a two-time NFL MVP and was selected to four Pro Bowls. 
Warner made a third trek to the Super Bowl during the 2008 season when he led the Arizona Cardinals to the franchise’s first division title since 1975 and its first-ever Super Bowl appearance.

Kurt joins Randy for the next edition of our celebration of the 25th anniversary of the GSOT talking about why the win against Cincinnati set the table after a strong start to the season, how the unselfish mentality made the talent even greater on the field, his comparison to the story of David &amp; Goliath, why the 49ers game was the first time he felt like the team could do something special
