The Chargers joined the AFL in 1960 as the Los Angeles Chargers before moving to San Diego in 1961 where they remained until 2017 when the franchise moved back to LA. The Chargers have had some long playoff droughts including from 1966-78, 1983-91, and 1996-2003. 
It was 25 years ago Wednesday that the Chargers reached their one and only Super Bowl by beating the favored Steelers, 17-13, in the AFC Championship Game in Pittsburgh.Let the record show the Char 
1994 was the first season in which the NFL used a salary cap; it was set at $33.8 million. [2] This created a new challenge for teams trying to retain their top players and to a major turnover of personnel in San Diego, with ten starters from 1993 cut, traded or leaving through free agency.

Super Bowl XXIX was groundbreaking for the San Francisco 49ers, but it also marked the last time the team would qualify for Super Bowl contention until the 2012-13 season. As of today, the San Diego Chargers have yet to return to the Super Bowl stage since 1995. 
The Chargers were the biggest surprise of the 1994 season, with very few expecting them to even reach the playoffs, let alone the Super Bowl. San Diego suffered losing seasons in the 1980s until former Washington Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard joined the team in 1990. 
The San Diego Chargers have 1 game played in Super Bowls all-time.
