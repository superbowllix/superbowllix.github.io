        <p>Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). 
Super Bowl LVIII was watched by 58.8 million women -- the “most ever, and an increase" of 9% from last year, which was greater than the 7% "boost in total viewership," according to Ryan Glasspiegel of the N.Y. POST. Women made up 47.5% of the total audience, the "highest composition ever.” 
Just as women’s sports are among the fastest-growing parts of the entire sports industry, women were a dominant story in final Super Bowl LVIII viewership figures.. Data from measurement agency Nielsen showed the final audience for Super Bowl LVIII reached an average of 123.7 million, up slightly from fast national estimates of 123.4 million and reconfirming the game’s status as the

Viewership of women younger than 50 increased 8%, while men in the same range were up 4%. Women aged 35-64 also watched at a 7% higher clip. “All told, girls and women accounted for a record 47.5% of the Super Bowl audience, as 5 million more females watched this year’s game than was the case a year ago,” Sportico added. 
Yet underlying the gaggle of talent is a shift in its makeup, which, intentionally or not, mirrors that of NFL and Super Bowl viewership: More women are entering the picture. AD METER 2025 : Vote  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers.

The relationship between Super Bowl advertisers and women viewers has run the course of many a rom-com: from catching feelings, to the misunderstandings on the road to true love. Whether the happy ending is ahead is still a work in progress we will see play out in this year’s game. 
Last night, ratings were down about 3% overall from Super Bowl 51 in 2017 and the lowest in eight years, but women constituted about 49% of the 108 million-plus people who watched the game  
In 2023, the Super Bowl drew 115.1 million viewers, followed by 123.4 million in 2024.  58.8 million women watched Super Bowl LVIII, a 9% increase from the previous year.
