        <h2><strong>super bowl viewership numbers by year super bowl 21</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Final numbers gave Super Bowl III a national rating of 36.0, lower than the previous year, though the total viewership was up from 51.3 million to 54.5 million. [59] In contrast with previous years, Super Bowl IV's ratings were largely underestimated. 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl

The average viewership number for this Super Bowl was 114,810,000. The air date for Super Bowl XLIX was on February 1, 2015. 2. Super Bowl LVII: Kansas City Chiefs vs Philadelphia Eagles. Super Bowl LVII was aired on FOX. While the Chiefs and Eagles will square off in this year’s Super Bowl, they also faced each other two years ago in the  
The 21.8 million number refers to Out Of Home (OOH) viewers who watched the Super Bowl LVI in bars, restaurants, and other venues, including viewing in other people’s homes. To make it easy to get the numbers right, I have compiled a chart with viewership stats from 2013-2024 of all the numbers reported by the broadcast networks. 
While that number is high, it wasn't the highest in Super Bowl history. Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between  
It was the second straight year the Super Bowl averaged more than 100 million viewers after a period where four of the five games before 2023 had fallen short of that number because of cord-cutting. That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. 
“No matter how or where viewers watch the game–at home with family and friends, at a bar, or streaming–Nielsen has the advanced measurement capabilities to capture the audience for the biggest TV event of the year.” The broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII ran from approximately 6:40 PM ET to 10:45 PM ET on CBS, Univision, Nickelodeon and Nick  
There were 114.2 million people tuning in for the Super Bowl when the Chiefs beat the Eagles last year, according to Sports Media Watch, which set a viewership record. Across all platforms, it's  
The Kansas City Chiefs' last-second 38-35 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, one of the highest-scoring games in Super Bowl history, delivered massive viewership numbers, as well. 
The second most watched Super Bowl was aired in the previous year, when the Kansas City Chiefs won against the Philadelphia Eagles.  NFL teams ranked by number of Super Bowl appearances all

Last year’s numbers were startling: An estimated 123.7 million viewers smashed the record set the previous year, and the number of people who watched at least a portion of the game also set a  
That’s 2.1 million more than the 113 million viewers initially reported after the game, making it the most-watched Super Bowl of all time, topping the 114.4 million viewers who watched New  
The Super Bowl proved to be a record-breaking culmination of an already historically impressive year for NFL games—matchups during the 2023 regular season drew an average of 17.9 million viewers  
Super Bowl XX became the first game to surpass 90 million viewers and it would take another 20 years for the NFL to break 100 million viewers, as 106.5 million tuned in to watch Drew Brees and

More than 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all-or-part of Super Bowl LVIII across all networks, the highest unduplicated total audience in history and up +10% versus last year's Super Bowl (183.6 million). Univision averaged more than 2.2 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. 
While the Super Bowl has managed to remain the most-watched live event of the year, it has not managed to maintain its robust viewership numbers in the age of cord-cutting and media saturation. Despite the trend of lower viewership, there is one instance that raises audience interest, but it remains outside of the NFL’s direct control: too  </p>
