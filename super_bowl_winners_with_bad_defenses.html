        <p>The 5 worst defenses to win a Super Bowl were: 2011 Giants 25th, 2006 Colts 23rd, 2009 Saints 20th, 2007 Giants 17th, and this year’s Chiefs with a rank of 16 were the 5th worst defense to win a Super Bowl. The 5 worst offenses to win a Super bowl were: 2008 Steelers 20th, 2015 Broncos 19th, 2002 Buccaneers 18th, 1990 Giants 15th, 2000 Ravens  
Their top-tier Super Bowl defense regressed to 11th in '06, and Big Ben finished with 18 touchdown passes and a league-high 23 interceptions. Pittsburgh started 2-6 and could not recover in an 8-8  
The old saw that defense wins championships has held up pretty well over the life of the NFL, and the last four Super Bowl winners have all had terrific defenses that pushed them into the  
The 2006 Colts were the worst Super Bowl winners in terms of rushing defense, giving up 173 YPG. The Chiefs aren’t near that mark, allowing 117.5. Also, was there anything that changed late in the season for those Colts that gave their defense a huge improvement and essentially won the Super Bowl for them that year? 
The largest difference was both 2017 and 2018, in which the Super Bowl Winner's defense was 22nd places higher than the MVP Best defense to win the Super Bowl; tied 2013 Broncos/2015 Panthers. Worst defense to win the Super Bowl; 2011 Giants (Only team with a defensive EPA/Play ranked in the bottom half of the league).

The Kansas City Chiefs managed to stay ahead of the San Francisco 49ers, 25 to 22, in Super Bowl LVIII on February 11. Interpreted as: defensive rankings of last superbowl winners

The better defense in the Super Bowl usually wins Defensive rankings are really only applicable dating back to Super Bowl 5, because the first four were meetings of the AFL and NFL champions. 
That defense suffocated 15-1 Packers and 18-0 Pats, and 13-3 Pats, all recors breaking offenses.  Yeah I've argued a bunch that the 2011 Giants are the worst Super  
Some things to think about: The number 1 ranked defense has won the Superbowl %28.57 of the time while the number 1 offense has only won the Superbowl %20.41 of the time, and only twice (1972 Dolphins and the 1996 Packers) has a Superbowl winner been ranked first in both offense and defense.

The New York Giants are responsible for the lowest-ranked defense to win the Super Bowl in the past 20 years, with their 25th-ranked defense defeating the New England Patriots in 2012. With a ranking of nine that season (below the average offensive ranking of Super Bowl champions in the past 20 years), their offense can hardly be credited with  
The only team to go 15-1 and fail to win a playoff game, these Packers fielded a much better squad in their Super Bowl title defense than the 10-6 team that became champion.
