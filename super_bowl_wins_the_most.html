        <h2><strong>super bowl wins the most detroit lions super bowl t shirt</strong></h2>
        <p>At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos). 
The New England Patriots have won the Super Bowl a record six times, most recently Super Bowl LIII in February 2019. Joining them at the top of this list is the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose most  
Super Bowl champions by year. 1967 Super Bowl (1): Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 1968 Super Bowl (2): Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14 1969 Super Bowl (3): New York Jets 16  
The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers have the most Super Bowl wins in league history with six each. In second place, the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco both have five championship rings. 
Most Super Bowl Losses Without a Win. For some teams, they haven’t been able to find success when reaching the Super Bowl. The most notable is the Buffalo Bills who lost 4 Super Bowls in a row from 1990-93. Take a look at the teams with the most losses in the Super Bowl without ever winning it all. 
The Steelers had the most Super Bowl wins with six until a Patriots win in Super Bowl 53 moved Tom Brady and Co. into a tie for the most championships in NFL history. Now the 49ers have a chance  
Their first championship was a 39-20 drubbing of the Broncos on Jan. 25, 1987, with Phil Simms winning the Super Bowl MVP award. The Giants' most recent Super Bowl wins were in 2008 and 2012, when  
Pittsburgh was the first team to win three, four and six Super Bowls, winning the sixth and most recent one at the end of the 2008 season. The Steelers had a chance to win a seventh Super Bowl  
The Packers won the first two Super Bowls (1966 and 1967) but had to wait 30 years for the next win, which came in Super Bowl XXXI. The team’s most recent Super Bowl victory capped off the 2010  
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
Reid, 66, owns the most wins by an Eagles coach in franchise history, and he's already defeated Philadelphia once in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs' current championship streak began with a Super Bowl  
4 wins: Green Bay Packers, New York Giants, Kansas City Chiefs 3 wins: Denver Broncos, Washington Redskins/Commanders, LA / Oakland Raiders In 2025, Super Bowl LIX sees the Philadelphia Eagles  
So which teams have appeared in the Super Bowl the most? Here is the list. ADVERTISEMENT.  Most Super Bowl wins by NFL franchise, ranked: 1. (tie) New England Patriots - 6 wins; 1. 
Quarterback Tom Brady has won the most NFL championships, with seven. Tom Brady (quarterback) won Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LIII with the New England Patriots after the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2018 seasons, respectively. [1] He won Super Bowl LV with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the 2020 season. [2] 
More specifically, since the first Super Bowl in 1967, the NFC East has been the most successful division in the NFL, grabbing 21 NFC championships and 13 Super Bowl victories. 
Mike Wilson, John Stallworth and Lynn Swann are tied for the most career wins by a wide receiver in Super Bowls, with 4 wins. 
The New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most wins in Super Bowls, with 6 wins. 
In his Super Bowl career, the six-time champion has the most starts (10) and wins (6) as a quarterback. He also holds the most career passing yards (2,838) and career passing touchdowns (18) in  
In addition, there are 22 players (including QB Terry Bradshaw and RB Franco Harris) who were part of all four Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl wins after the 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons. </p>
