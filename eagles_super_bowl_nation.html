Foles presented owner Jeffrey Lurie with the Halas trophy. “We’re there to win it,” Lurie said about going back to the Super Bowl. 
When is the last time the Eagles were in the Super Bowl? The Eagles were in the Super Bowl two years ago. They took on the Chiefs in Super Bowl 57 in 2023 (after the 2022 season) and lost, 38-35.
