Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The average age of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is 30.71 years of age. Over the course of NFL history that seems to fit with what one would think of as the prime of a quarterback’s career. 
As a 23 year old sophomore he was comfortable in the postseason, seemed scared shitless in his first Super Bowl. And then at age 26 in year 5, he was comfortable in his second Super Bowl. Idk how the stats reflect that progression, especially with how the OL was almost a polar opposite in 2008 from how it was in 2005, but that’s what I  
Super Bowl QB Age: The Rarity of Twentysomething QBs. Super Bowl 57 marks only the 12th time the NFL title game has featured two starting QBs in their 20s, accounting for merely 21% of contests. In fact, it happened only twice in the first 29 Super Bowls.

Not only is Brady one of the oldest quarterbacks to play/win a Super Bowl, he’s one of the oldest quarterbacks in the history of the NFL. Until early 2020 when he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes can win a fourth Super Bowl before turning 30. That opportunity is there when the Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59 at the Caesars  
Brady could've been on this list three separate times as he has won a Super Bowl at ages 39, 41, and his latest at age 43, making him the oldest player to ever win the Super Bowl. The seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback has racked up more Super Bowl wins than any franchise has in history.
