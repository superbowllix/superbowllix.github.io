        <h2><strong>how were the super bowl ratings what time does the super bowl game really start</strong></h2>
        <p>In 1979, the Super Bowl XIII broadcast recorded a drop in both average and total viewership, and the rating decreased by 0.1 to a 47.1, though all were the second-best numbers ever for the game and the share grew by 7 percentage points to a 74. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
9. Super Bowl XLVII – 108,693,000 average viewership; 10. Super Bowl XLIV – 106,476,000 average viewership; Super Bowls XLVII and XLIV were aired on CBS, while Super Bowls XLV and LI were aired on FOX. NBC aired Super Bowl XLVI. The 10th most-watched Super Bowl featured the New Orleans Saints defeating the Indianapolis Colts 31-17. 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
The audience for Super Bowl LVIII was so large that it approached the all-time most watched television broadcast in the United States set in 1969, when an estimated 125 to 150 million viewers  
The Super Bowl on Sunday drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers who watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in a nail-biting overtime triumph, CBS Sports said in a  
That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched program in television history, with an average of 123.7 million viewers tuning in to the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win versus the 49ers. 
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of  
The Super Bowl LVIII scored a ratings touchdown.  Records were set across the board with the game standing as the most-streamed Super Bowl ever, setting a new viewership record for Paramount+  
Fans in the Boston market were as interested in watching Brady in the Super Bowl as ever. The rating in Boston was 57.6, according to Sports Business Journal, which is the second best Super Bowl  
That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
There's a new Super Bowl TV ratings record, as an average of 120.3 million viewers tuned in on CBS to watch the Chiefs beat the 49ers. 
Although the Super Bowl 56 viewership increased by 4% than last year, the overall TV rating is 36.9 which is the lowest since Super Bowl 3. The Super Bowl 1969 between Jets and Colts had a TV rating of 36.0. As per NBC report the highest local market rating was from Cincinnati, which grabbed 46.1/84. However, the home city Los Angeles didn’t  
The gaudy 123.4 million is based on fast ratings from Nielsen, with final numbers due out on Tuesday morning (Feb. 13). Sunday's ratings were up by 7% over last year's game, which drew 115.1  
Women accounted for 47.5% of the overall audience, up from 46.7% last year. (Per the New York Post, that 47.5% mark is a new record for the Super Bowl.) There were 4.4 million additional female viewers than last year, compared to 3.0 million additional male viewers. Super Bowl 58 demographic breakdown 
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
What does that mean for this year's Super Bowl ratings?  The Wild Card Round saw a 6% decline, the Divisional Round dropped 7%, and the Conference Championships were down 9% compared to 2024. 
The Feb. 11 Super Bowl game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers brought in an average of 123.4 million viewers — the highest number of people watching the same broadcast  </p>
