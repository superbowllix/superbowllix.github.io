The Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team, representing the University of Delaware, has had 29 players drafted into the National Football League (NFL) since the league began holding drafts in 1936.

Two victorious alumni of the Stanford Cardinal have three Super Bowl rings between them: Former Denver Broncos star John Elway has two (Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII in 1997 and 1998, respectively), while Jim Plunkett also won two as the quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams in 1981 in

He led the Ravens to the Super Bowl XLVII title in 2012 and was named the game’s Most Valuable Player after throwing for 287 yards and three touchdowns in the 34-31 win over San Francisco. At the time of his induction into the UD Athletics Hall of Fame, he had thrown for nearly 30,000 yards during his career. 
Delaware, one of only 10 schools in the nation to have two quarterbacks start in a Super Bowl, now becomes one of the few schools to produce an NFL most valuable player (Gannon), a Super Bowl MVP (Flacco) and a NFL Pro Bowl MVP (Gannon).

Within Delaware's NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) classification, the Blue Hens had the second highest number of alumni in the NFL during the 2015 season. This roster includes 2012 Super Bowl champion and Most Valuable Player Joe Flacco, BE08, quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens. 
• Roger Staubach (VI, XII) and Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) both attended Navy. • Joe Flacco (XLVII) and the incumbent president both attended University of Delaware.

Joe Flacco led the Baltimore Ravens to a hard-fought 34-31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII in February.

Gannon won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award after a record-setting 2002 season, throwing for 4,689 yards and 26 touchdowns and recording a career-high 97.2 passer rating, [44] which helped the Raiders advance to Super Bowl XXXVII, making him the first former Blue Hens quarterback to start a Super Bowl.

How many Super Bowl winning starting quarterbacks has your school produced? How many wins can they each brag about? That's going to mean something different in the near future with all the transfers and movements in the college game - Wisconsin gets credit for Russell Wilson, not NC State, and of course UCLA can claim Troy Aikman, not Oklahoma - but it's all fairly obvious.
