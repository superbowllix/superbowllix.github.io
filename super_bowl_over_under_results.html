        <h2><strong>super bowl over under results super bowl lviii jugadores</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl 59 is now upon us, as the NFL prepares to kickoff 2025 Super Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana at 6:30pm ET. Before betting the big game, you may want to know what has happened in previous Super Bowls with similar narratives, or even the most recent results. 
Taking out two pushes and one pick ’em game, favorites are 28-27 (51%) in the game against the spread. The over/under is split exactly down the middle with 29 games going over the total and 29 staying under (Super Bowl I had no over/under odds posted, but one would have to assume it would have gone over with 45 points scored). 
For OVER/UNDER bets, a total point threshold is set, such as the 49.5 total point mark for Super Bowl LIX. Bettors predict whether the combined score of both teams will be OVER or UNDER this number. The UNDER has hit in five of the last six Super Bowls. 
Super Bowl betting trends show tight ATS and O/U results. Favorites are 28-27-2 in the 57 Super Bowls that have been contested. The OVER and UNDER are deadlocked at 28-28 in Super Bowl betting  
The Chiefs advanced to their third straight Super Bowl with a cover as 1-point home favorites in a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game Sunday as the Over (49) hit. QB Patrick Mahomes was 18-of-26 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD, while adding 2 more TDs on the ground as he rushed for 43 yards on 11 carries. 
The ‘over/under’ has gone 29-28 in the first 58 Super Bowl matchups. No total was posted on Super Bowl I between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. In the 2019 Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
Super Bowl XIX (19) Game: San Francisco 49ers vs. Miami Dolphins Spread: 49ers (-3) Over/Under: 53.5 SU Result: 49ers, 38-16 ATS Result: 49ers covered by 19 points Super Bowl XX (20) 
Over/Under Betting Trends. There was no over/under for the total score for Super Bowl I. That leaves us with 55 years of robust data, which shows that taking the under in each Super Bowl would have been correct 29 times (53%). Given the betting lines that generally accompany over/unders, this data in a vacuum is hardly actionable. 
In terms of the over/under, the results are split almost exactly down the middle. Of the 56 Super Bowls with over/under data, 28 games have gone over the total, while 28 have stayed under. It is worth mentioning that the first Super Bowl had no over/under odds posted, but with 45 points scored, one would assume it would have gone over. 
Favorites are 28-28-2 in the 58 Super Bowls that have been contested. The UNDER is 29-28 in Super Bowl betting history. There was no total posted for Super Bowl 1. This year's Big Game will be a  
A: Many sports websites and online sportsbooks will post the current Super Bowl over/under line. Q: How do I place an over/under bet? A: You can place an over/under bet at a sportsbook, either online or at a physical location, depending on the laws in your area. Conclusion. The Super Bowl over/under is a fascinating and popular bet. 
If you’re looking to cash a bet before Super Bowl 59 even begins, then betting on the National Anthem length may be the one for you. Betting on whether the National Anthem will go over a set number of seconds has grown in popularity in recent years, and this year won’t be any different. 
However, these teams also have two of the best defenses in the NFL, making this year’s Super Bowl Over/Under an intriguing betting market worth digging into. Chiefs Over/Under Trends 
Jon Batiste will be performing the national anthem at Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans. FanDuel sportsbook opened the over/under on the length of Batiste’s national anthem at 120.5 seconds, or two minutes and 0.5 seconds. 
Super Bowl betting trends show tight ATS and O/U results. Favorites are 28-27-2 in the 57 Super Bowls that have been contested. The OVER and UNDER are deadlocked at 28-28 in Super Bowl betting
