        <h2><strong>super bowl winning eagles qb super bowl winners lviii</strong></h2>
        <p>Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
Philadelphia's first Super Bowl appearance was a 27-10 loss to the then-Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 15. Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett threw for three touchdowns while Eagles signal-caller Ron  
Eagles QB Jalen Hurts had a big day through the air in Philadelphia's win over the Washington Commanders to advance to Super Bowl LIX. Eagles HC Nick Sirianni said on Tuesday he didn't make much  
Donovan McNabb is the only other QB to pay in the Super Bowl for the Eagles this century, but the PFF list doesn't go back to the 2004 season. Even if it did, McNabb wouldn't be among the top five. 
Nick Foles #9 of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after his teams 41-33 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII at U.S. Bank Stadium on February 4  
In the win that brought the Eagles their one and, so far, only Lombardi Trophy, Foles completed 28-of-43 passes for 373 passing yards, three touchdowns, one interception, and a 106.1 passer rating  
His 119.2 passer rating from 2013 is 4 th-highest in NFL history (behind Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and 2020 and Peyton Manning in 2004), his 9.1 yards per attempt is 12 th-highest in history, his 14.2 yards per completion is 6 th-highest in the last 30 years, his touchdown percentage — one TD every 11.7 attempts — is 12 th-highest in NFL history and his interception percentage – one every  
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles (9) holds his daughter, Lily James, after winning the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game against the New England Patriots, Sunday, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis. 
Nick Foles completed his fairy-tale season by leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a win in Super Bowl LII and being named the game's MVP. Jeffri Chadiha chronicles an unbelievable run. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33  Philadelphia had overcome a late-season ACL tear by QB Carson Wentz and  
Carson Wentz once again will mostly be a spectator on the sidelines during a Super Bowl appearance by the Philadelphia Eagles. Seven years after he watched his backup Nick Foles win the MVP after delivering the Eagles their first Super Bowl title, Wentz is back on the big stage as a backup to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes as the Chiefs prepare to take on his former team and his former backup  
Prisco's 2025 Super Bowl pick: In Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs we trust; QB leads game-winning drive vs. Eagles Pete Prisco isn't picking against Mahomes and the back-to-back champs 
He is The Other Quarterback in Super Bowl 2025, if only because he isn’t the one 60 minutes from a three-peat.  Nick Bolton forces Jalen Hurts to fumble during the Chiefs' Super Bowl win over  
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Won Super Bowl 41-33 vs. New England Patriots. Offensive Coordinator: Frank Reich. Defensive Coordinator: Jim Schwartz. Other Notable Asst.: John DeFilippo (Quarterbacks), Ken Flajole (Linebackers), Mike Groh (Wide Receivers), Press Taylor (Off. Quality Control/Asst. Quarterbacks) and Cory Undlin (Defensive Backs) Stadium: Lincoln Financial Field 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Foles led the Eagles to winning the 2018 Super Bowl after starting QB Carson Wentz suffered a knee injury late in the season.  Nick Foles, Super Bowl-winning QB with Eagles, retires from NFL. 
The first Black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl, he was named the game's MVP and went on to a long career as an NFL coach and executive.  The youngest quarterback in Eagles  
Jalen Hurts has held a press conference every day this week in the build-up to the Super Bowl and the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback has somehow managed to keep his name out of the headlines.Doug  </p>
