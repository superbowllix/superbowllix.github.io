Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio was an assistant coach with the Baltimore Ravens in the early 2000s when hall-of-fame legend Ray Lewis was on staff. Perhaps Vangio’s defensive genius will finally help the Eagles prevail against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV. 
NEW ORLEANS — The oldest NFL defensive coordinator slips into a gray chair, tucked in the back row of a hotel conference room. Super Bowl kickoff is four days away, and there are wrinkles to  
Vic Fangio, the NFL's oldest defensive coordinator at age 66, is leading the youngest defense in the league with the Philadelphia Eagles, who are preparing for the Super Bowl. Despite past struggles as head coach of the Broncos, Fangio has successfully transformed the Eagles' defense, culminating in a top-two ranking in total defense and  
The NFL's Assistant Coach of the Year in 2018 when he was with the Bears, Fangio – dubbed an "evil genius" by edge rusher Khalil Mack, who played for Fangio in Chicago – worked as a defensive consultant during the Eagles' run to Super Bowl LVII in 2022 before joining the Dolphins. 
The NFL's Assistant Coach of the Year in 2018 when he was with the Bears, Fangio – dubbed an "evil genius" by edge rusher Khalil Mack, who played for Fangio in Chicago – worked as a consultant during the Eagles' run to Super Bowl LVII in 2022 before joining the Miami Dolphins in 2023 as defensive coordinator. 
The Eagles agreed to hire Fangio on Jan. 25, 2024, less than 24 hours after he mutually parted ways with the Miami Dolphins after serving for one year as their defensive coordinator. There were  
Prior to his stint with the Dolphins, Fangio spent the 2022 season as a consultant for the Eagles, when the team advanced to Super Bowl LVII. One of the most respected defensive minds in football, Vic Fangio was named defensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles during the 2024 offseason. 
The Philadelphia Eagles’ defensive transformation in 2024 has propelled the team to an 8-2 record and a six-game winning streak, marking one of the most remarkable turnarounds in the NFL this  
Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio told me Jalen Carter has an illness that is going around through some of the team, but he hopes Jalen will be good for the Super Bowl. 
Fangio embarks on his 38th NFL season and 21st as a defensive coordinator in 2024 after being hired by the Eagles this offseason. He was the defensive assistant for the USFL's Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars in 1984-85, helping the team win back-to-back championships before the league folded in 1986. 
One of the unsung heroes of the Eagles' Super Bowl run this season has been defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Taking over a mess of a defensive unit from the year prior, Fangio turned the Eagles  
Compared to Super Bowl LVII against Kansas City, Philadelphia had seven defensive starters from that game who are no longer part of the Eagles for Super Bowl LIX. On the defensive line, powerful  
Here's a look at the Philadelphia defense, including its Super Bowl depth chart and how it acquired its top defensive players ahead of Chiefs vs. Eagles in Super Bowl 59. Eagles defensive depth  
Patrick Mahomes is undefeated (8-0) against Vic Fangio-led defenses, but the Kansas City Chiefs QB is expecting the Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator to change things up in Super Bowl LIX. 
Vic Fangio was the San Francisco 49ers’ defensive coordinator when the team played the Baltimore Ravens at the Superdome in Super Bowl XLVII. The Ravens topped the 49ers for the team’s second  
Carr was the defensive coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1970-1971 seasons, a total of two years. Carr's record as the team's defensive coordinator was 9-17-2, making him the second-least successful defensive coordinator in Philadelphia Eagles history. 
On Sunday, Jones and Philadelphia defensive tackle Jalen Carter could play Donald-esque game-wrecker roles in the Super Bowl LIX matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles at the Superdome. 
Now at age 66, Fangio is at the Super Bowl in New Orleans, where he started his NFL coaching career, as defensive coordinator with the Philadelphia Eagles team he grew up supporting with a chance  </p>
