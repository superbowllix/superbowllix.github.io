        <h2><strong>eagles qb during super bowl win super bowl 2025 numero</strong></h2>
        <p>When Super Bowl 59 kicks off, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will become one of just two active players to start in multiple Super Bowls, joining his counterpart, Patrick Mahomes. The two signal  
Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
Hurts turned in an elite Super Bowl debut to close 2022, scoring four total touchdowns in a 38-35 defeat to Mahomes' Chiefs, but he also lost a fumble in that one. 
The Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41–33 to win their first Super Bowl. [93] Foles completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards, 3 passing touchdowns, and 1 interception, and was named the Most Valuable Player of the game. 
Their first Super Bowl win came seven years ago, when quarterback Nick Foles and coach Doug Pederson led the 2017 Eagles to a 41-33 defeat of the New England Patriots. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33  Philadelphia had overcome a late-season ACL tear by QB Carson Wentz and  
Maybe the biggest throw of Foles’ career was his 4 th-down completion to Zach Ertz during the game-winning drive in the Super Bowl. The Patriots had just taken a 33-32 lead on Brady’s touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski with 9:22 left, and with 5:39 left the Eagles faced a 4 th -and-2 on their own 45-yard-line. 
Nick Foles #9 of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after his teams 41-33 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII at U.S. Bank Stadium on February 4  
Jalen Hurts had one of Philadelphia’s four rushing touchdowns and the Eagles soared into the Super Bowl, forcing both of San Francisco’s quarterbacks out of the game with injuries and beating the wounded 49ers 31-7 in the NFC championship game. 
In Super Bowl 2023, Philadelphia Eagles QB Jalen Hurts threw for more yards than Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes (304-182) in Kansas City's 38-35 victory.If you want to bet that happening again, DraftKings makes Hurts a +170 underdog to have more passing yards than Mahomes (-235) in Super Bowl LIX. 
The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, who was considering walking away from professional football just last offseason, won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award after leading Philly past the  
The 35-year-old Foles was a third-round pick by the Eagles in 2012 and played five years over two stints in Philadelphia. Foles made the Pro Bowl in 2013 after throwing seven touchdown passes in a  
Now he will try to become the fourth quarterback to win the NFL’s ultimate prize as a starting quarterback after losing his first Super Bowl start. Hurts came close two years ago when Philadelphia lost 38-35 to Kansas City in Glendale, Arizona. With a win next week in New Orleans, Hurts would become the first quarterback since John Elway 27  
The German shepherd masks were introduced during the 2017 season as a play on the underdog theme the Eagles thrived on along the way to a Super Bowl victory over Tom Brady and the New England  
Hurts was 20 of 34 for 278 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions and led the Eagles to a 34-29 victory over the Green Bay Packers in the season opener. Saquon Barkley scored three touchdowns and A.J. Brown caught five passes for 119 yards, including a 67-yard touchdown in a win that set the tone for arguably the best regular season in franchise history. 
In this Jan. 25, 1981, Oakland Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett (16) throws during NFL football's Super Bowl XV in New Orleans against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
How Many Super Bowls Have the Eagles Played In? Super Bowl 15 — January 1981; Super Bowl 39 — February 2005; Super Bowl 52 — February 2018; Super Bowl 57 — February 2023; Although the Eagles have appeared in four Super Bowls, they also made several championship appearances in the pre-Super Bowl era. 
The Philadelphia Eagles are a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night in New Orleans away from winning the franchise’s second Super Bowl following a 55-23 thrashing of the Washington  
The Eagles last made the Super Bowl just two seasons ago against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 57. During that season, Jalen Hurts first emerged as an MVP candidate. His partnership with head coach Nick Sirianni immediately led to outstanding results for the team, which ran through the NFC with an unreal average margin of victory (27.5  </p>
