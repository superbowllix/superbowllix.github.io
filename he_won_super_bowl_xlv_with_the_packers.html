He was the last man to talk to the team before the Super Bowl, ditching a long-planned speech he'd written when Lloyd Carr, his coach at Michigan, texted him and said, "Remember, just win." That is what he told the Packers before the biggest game of their lives. Just win. "It was pretty emotional," said kicker Mason Crosby.

Super Bowl XLV was the 45th annual edition of the Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the modern-era National Football League (NFL) to determine the 91st team to become NFL World Champions.

The Green Bay Packers won their 13th league title in franchise history, putting them far and away ahead of any other team in NFL history. The Chicago Bears are second with nine; in third place lurk the New York Giants. And the Giants had seven NFL championships at the time of Super Bowl XLV; they would try to make it eight in Super Bowl XLVI.

Although the Patriots won 31-27, the Packers finished the game on the New England 15-yard line and ran out of time to take the lead. Despite the loss, the Packers were encouraged by their performance without Rodgers. The loss dropped the Packers to 8-6 on the season and made their final two games must-wins to make the playoffs.
