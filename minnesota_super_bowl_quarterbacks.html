        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Moon was the Minnesota Vikings' starting quarterback from 1994 to 1996. Daunte Culpepper was the Vikings' starting quarterback for six seasons from 2000 to 2005. Jim McMahon was the Vikings' starting quarterback for the 1993 season. Brett Favre took over as the Vikings' starting quarterback in 2009. 
After a solid six-year stint in the Twin Cities, Cousins is one of the best quarterbacks in Minnesota Vikings history. Cousins is the Vikings all-time leader in passer rating (101.2), 2nd in passing touchdowns (171), and 3rd in passing yards (23,265). In Minnesota, Kirk topped 4,200+ yards passing four times and 30+ TDs three times.

It has been a long, long time since the Minnesota Vikings last went a Super Bowl. They are 0-4 and have not been to the big game since the 1976 regular season. As Kirk Cousins looks to break the streak in 2020, let's take a look at the QBs who have taken on the task before him. 
Minnesota's first appearance in the Super Bowl was Super Bowl IV in 1970 when the Chiefs toppled the Vikings 23-7. They returned to the Super Bowl four years later to face off against the Dolphins  
A. Dan Marino was 23 years and 127 days old when he started the Super Bowl for the Miami Dolphins on Jan. 20, 1985, making him the youngest starting Super Bowl quarterback. Q. Who is the oldest

Have the Vikings Ever Won the Super Bowl? No. The Minnesota Vikings have never won the Super Bowl. The Vikings have reached the Super Bowl a total of four times (1970, 1974, 1975, and 1977) but have never won. They are one of two teams in NFL history that have reached the Super Bowl four times without a win. The other is the Buffalo Bills. 
Mailata added, “Second year as a full-year starter, and he’s taking us to the Super Bowl?” Mahomes, meanwhile, started for the Chiefs in what was his third Super Bowl appearance in five seasons. The 27-year-old is just one of three Black quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl, leading the Chiefs to a title in 2020 over the San Francisco 49ers. 
Sam Darnold, a former No. 1 draft pick now on his fourth team, has Minnesota undefeated through six weeks. He's drawing comparisons to his rival on Sunday, Lions QB Jared Goff. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.

Kansas City's Len Dawson became the fourth consecutive winning quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP. He completed 12 of 17 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown
