The Kansas City Chiefs are back-to-back Super Bowl champions. The Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime in Super Bowl 58 to win their second straight Super Bowl. 
The Chiefs are the first two-time defending Super Bowl champion to ever reach the Big Game. By Eric Mullin • Published September 4, 2024 • Updated on January 27, 2025 at 5:11 pm NBC Universal  
Here are the nine teams who have had a chance to three-peat as Super Bowl champions and their final result: 1968 Packers: 6-7-1, missed playoffs; 1974 Dolphins: 11-3, lost in divisional round; 
It’s worth noting that the Packers won three consecutive NFL championships in 1965, 1966, and 1967, but the first title was before the Super Bowl was implemented. In the Super Bowl era, the Patriots and Cowboys came closest to winning three straight. New England won three titles in four years between the 2001 and 2004 seasons. Meanwhile, the  
No team has won three Super Bowls in a row. The Kansas City Chiefs are back-to-back Super Bowl champions. It’s the first time since 2003-2004 that the NFL has had consecutive seasons end with  
The Chiefs are attempting to become the first team to win three Super Bowls in a row after defeating the Eagles in 2023 and the 49ers last year. So any Chiefs player on the roster for a third  
After the 49ers won their fourth title of the decade with a 55-10 dismantling of the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 24, San Francisco reached the NFC Championship against the New York Giants. 
Who was the last back-to-back Super Bowl champion? No team has won back-to-back Super Bowls since the 2003 and '04 Patriots. New England won three championships in Tom Brady's first four seasons  
The Green Bay Packers previously won three championships in a row from 1965-67, but the first was an NFL championship before they won the first two AFL-NFL world championships. 
After defeating the Buffalo Bills 32-29 in the AFC Championship round, the Kansas City Chiefs are going to the Super Bowl. They will try to accomplish something no team has ever done and that is win a third straight Super Bowl. In the AFC Championship game, Mahomes went 18/26, 245 passing yards, one passing TD, 43 rushing yards, and two rushing  
Before we get started, let me address the angry Chief fans in the room. Yes, if you win Super Bowl 59 you'll be the first team to win three straight Super Bowls.

On Jan. 26, the AFC and NFC Championship games took place, deciding which teams would face off against one another at Super Bowl LIX. AFC Champion: Kansas City Chiefs The Chiefs played a triumphant game against the Buffalo Bills at the infamous Arrowhead Stadium, their home stadium, clinching the AFC Champion title for the third year in a row.
