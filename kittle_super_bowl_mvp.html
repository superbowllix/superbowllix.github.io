Kittle is an active participant in the 49ers’ Salute to Service programming whose connection with service members goes beyond an initial introduction. After gifting the family of fallen Army soldier Sgt. Martin LaMar Super Bowl tickets, Kittle continues to host them at training camp and keeps Sgt. LaMar’s Purple Heart in his locker. 
Kittle will be recognized at NFL Honors on Thursday night. Kittle hosts military and frontline heroes at every 49ers game, donating more than 400 tickets in the last six years. Kittle and his family amplify community stories, nearly 60 of those involving veterans, through the Hidden Pearls Podcast founded in 2020. 
The NFL Foundation will match USAA's donation of $25,000, which will be given to Kittle's military charity of choice. “It really started with the 2019 Super Bowl,” Kittle told NBC Sports Bay Area in December. “I was able to send a family from the T.A.P.S. organization, that I had met at the 2018 Pro Bowl, to the Super Bowl.

Recognizing George Kittle’s Military Contributions. Kittle will be formally recognized during the NFL Honors, presented by Invisalign, on February 6, during Super Bowl LIX week in New Orleans. 
The San Francisco 49ers will represent the NFC in Super Bowl 58. They will take on the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, February 11. Along with the Super Bowl victory, the winning team will also have one player selected as the Super Bowl MVP. This is an award that has been given since the inception of the Super Bowl but has never been won by a

Pick: Kittle First 49ers Touchdown Scorer (+500) 1. Kittle Takes Home MVP Honours. We’re not done with Kittle yet. Perhaps the most mispriced line of the week is his odds for Super Bowl 54 MVP. Kittle is arguably the most talented player in this game from a size, speed, skill standpoint yet his MVP price is +1800. Super Bowl 54 MVP Odds </p>
