        <p>Truth be told I'm yet to see the appeal, but that's besides the point. I'm willing to give it a chance, so thought I'd stay up and watch the Super Bowl. Googled how long a match lasts and found out it's 60 minutes. I thought I'd allow (what I thought was a very generous) 30 minutes for half time, plus 10 minutes for the quarters and some stoppage.

Super Bowl XLVII, played on February 3, 2013, between the Ravens and the 49ers, lasted for 3 hours and 34 minutes in regular time. However, the game featured a 34-minute pause due to a power  
This year’s Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans will start at 5:30 pm local (Central Time), so those on the East Coast will want to be ready to watch for a 6:30 pm local kick-off, Mountain Time Super Bowl kick-off is at 4:30, and those on the west coast will be able to tune in and catch kick off at 3:30 pm local time. 
This year's Super Bowl will be held on Sunday, Feb. 9. What time will the Super Bowl start this year? Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. EST; expect programming to kick off 30 minutes to an hour  
The upcoming Super Bowl LIX is just days away. The Philadelphia Eagles take on the Kansas City Chiefs in a Super Bowl LVII rematch, looking for revenge and to put an end to the Chiefs' chance of completing a historic Super Bowl 3-peat. While Super Bowl Sunday essentially starts at 12:01 AM on  
SUPER BOWL LVIII. What time did the Super Bowl end? The NFL championship game was one of just two Super Bowls to go to overtime and the Chiefs secured a famous victory at the death. 
Super Bowl 2025 kickoff time. The AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs are playing the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. Mountain/5:30 p  
The final four played in the AFC and NFC championship games on January 26, and the winners made it into the Super Bowl. Kansas City advanced with a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC  
It was the dedicated streaming selection for the Super bowl. I opened up Paramount Plus (phone app, PC / web browser and TV VR Roku) and top center is the Super Bowl banner taking up almost whatever view you have. In the lower left of the Savannah is the WATCH NOW . Clicked on it and Face The Nation showed up instead of the Super bowl.

Coldplay is my favorite band, but IMO they seem like a very odd choice to have headline the Super Bowl halftime show. In a very short amount of time, they need to bring a lot of energy, intensity, and enough spectacle to entertain how ever many million people are watching. 
Missing the point. I'm talking about the Super Bowl versus the World Series. Sure. Ads on jerseys and all over the outfield are obnoxious, but the game remains the same all year. The Super Bowl is watered down and becomes about everything surrounding it. Pageantry, performances, and big names. 
2014 Divisional Round against the Ravens though. overcame a 14 point deficit twice.That game was something else. SB51 was incredible and is definitely up there in best games, but I've seen that game before against the 49ers, I think back in like 2012 was the game where we got blown out and then came back hard (lost unfortunately by like 3 points) and the Broncos I think in 2013 where we were  
I have time to killgonna do a full prediction lol My heart wants Cincy to win but I think the Rams experience in the Super Bowl will give them the slight edge. I have this game playing out like Pittsburgh/Arizona SB43 did. A couple of exciting late lead changes, but ultimately the Rams come out on top. SUPER BOWL 56

Nobody cares about a game before the super bowl where players can get injured and don’t even really try. Hell I’d take a 7 on 7 two hand touch game or something. Reply reply 
Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money. 
44 votes, 138 comments. true. Super Bowl 38 was a pretty insane game. Starts off as a defensive stalemate and then both offenses go off towards the end of the first half. </p>
