        <h2><strong>is the super bowl parade over kendrick lamar replaced for super bowl</strong></h2>
        <p>Every year since, the Super Bowl parade has been at Disneyland. We went to yet another of these in 2022 after the hometown Los Angeles Rams celebrated their Super Bowl LVI victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. I couldn’t pass up seeing former Detroit Lion Matthew Stafford, plus Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald of the Los Angeles Rams. 
The Super Bowl parade has not taken place at Magic Kingdom since 2020, as the last parade that was planned for Magic Kingdom was canceled in 2021 due to the pandemic, so it has been a few years since it has happened at this park. The last few years of the Super Bowl parade have been at Disneyland in California. 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles go head-to-head in New Orleans this Sunday, February 9th. The winning team from the NFL’s annual Super Bowl game is usually celebrated at Walt Disney World with the Most Valuable Player (MVP) being part of the iconic “I’m going to Disney World!” commercial, before starring in a parade down Main Street U.S.A. 
The last time the Eagles won the Super Bowl, the parade was held the Thursday following the big game. Ideally, it would be the same again, and not just because it gives fans nearly a week to  
Mahomes appeared in the victory parade with Disney characters in Disneyland Park. The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a parade at Walt Disney World was in 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade on Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. 
Emphasizing that this is all extremely hypothetical, if the Birds were to win, the parade would take place in the days after the Super Bowl, which is on Feb. 9. 
It's finally here. Super Bowl events have taken over New Orleans, with just days before the big event, many roads are starting to close. New Orleans is preparing for a massive influx of visitors  
The tradition continues. Disney has confirmed that the Super Bowl LIX champions will make their way to Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom on Monday, February 10, 2025, for the iconic post-game celebration. Super Bowl LIX will feature a rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. 
Kansas City begins to plan for another possible Super Bowl Parade in the wake of tragedy. A big question looms as the Chiefs look to this weekend’s playoff game against the Texans and beyond. 
Temporary closures will also be in place during major events leading up to Feb. 9, including the NFL Honors event night on Feb. 6 and the city’s Super Bowl parade on Feb. 8. 
As a fan warm-up to the Super Bowl itself, a parade will roll through the streets of New Orleans on Saturday morning. The Carnival-style parade will be a unique event for the big game, with nearly

The four-time Super Bowl winner ‘just put the kiss of death on the Chiefs,’ said a fan.  He then predicted that Kansas City would win in a close game over the Eagles, with a final score of  
Just like 2023, the Eagles are headed to a Super Bowl game against the Kansas City Chiefs. And just like that matchup, Google trends data shows locals are fervently trying to figure out when the  
A shooting during last year's Super Bowl parade left one woman dead and 22 people injured.  Over the course of 58 Super Bowls, 64% of teams wearing white have gone on to win. 
Football fans will deny it, but there are actually some people in the U.S. who find the Super Bowl is not something they want to spend their Sunday watching. Between the pre-game, halftime, and  
16 WAPT and its parent company, Hearst Television, are proud to announce the official live broadcast of the inaugural New Orleans Super Bowl Host Committee Parade.The groundbreaking Mardi Gras-style celebration will take place Saturday, Feb. 8, at 10 a.m. CST. and will air live on 16 WAPT. This  
The Super Bowl is supposed to be about football. But let’s admit it, so many of us also watch it to see the special commercials that advertisers create specifically for the most-watched TV event  
The events that transpired last year at the Super Bowl parade were stressful, especially if your children witnessed them firsthand or on television. Reminders of this event can spark similar reactions to their experiences in 2024. When a child’s reactions to trauma persist after a few weeks, they may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). </p>
