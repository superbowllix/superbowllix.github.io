        <p>Tom Brady won an astounding seven Super Bowls. With each one came the iconic ring, which got more spectacular as the years passed. Let’s take a look at the seven rings won by the GOAT.

Tom Brady, the 45-year-old former New England Patriots, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback boasts an unparalleled seven Super Bowl championships, more than any player in NFL history. His victories came in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2021, solidifying his legacy as the most decorated player in the history of the NFL. 
However, the following year proved disappointing for the team, as they the title to the Philadelphia Eagles. Tom Brady won his sixth ring in Super Bowl LIII, defeating the Los Angeles Rams 13-3  
Patrick Mahomes likely has the best chance to match or beat Brady’s Super Bowl ring count. The 28-year-old Chiefs’ quarterback has won three Super Bowls already and has been to four.

Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl ring in the 2001 NFL season, his second year in the league. He would then go on to win five more Super Bowls with the Patriots in the 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2018 NFL seasons. 
Brady won his second Super Bowl two years later, defeating the Carolina Panthers 32-29 in Super Bowl 38. It was also his second Super Bowl MVP after completing 32-of-48 passes for 354 yards and

He won six rings with the Patriots during their run of success in the 2000s and 2010s with wins in Super Bowls 36, 38, 39, 49, 51 and 53. He added a record seventh title in Super Bowl 55 with the

Tom Brady has managed seven Super Bowl wins and therefore has seven rings. These wins came in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021. This is the most an NFL player has in American Football  
Even with winning another ring this Sunday, Mahomes will still trail Brady by three Super Bowl rings. Before Brady retired, he defeated Mahomes and the Chiefs twice in the players. Once in the  
In his first year as QB1, Brady led the Patriots to a Super Bowl 36 showdown against the Rams. Brady and Co. bested the "Greatest Show on Turf" to claim not only his first ring but the first
