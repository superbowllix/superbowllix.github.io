        <p>The last two Super Bowl's have set audience records, averaging 123.7 million viewers last year. This season NFL regular season and postseaon ratings have dropped 
[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
In 2024, Super Bowl LVII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers achieved a TV rating of 42.1, up from the all-time low of 36.9 two years prior. 
Sunday’s Rams-Bengals Super Bowl 56 averaged a 36.9 rating and 99.18 million viewers on NBC alone, 101.1 million viewers including Spanish-language coverage on Telemundo, and 112.3 million across all platforms — marking the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969 (Jets-Colts: 36.0) but the most-watched across all platforms since 2017 (Patriots

The audience for Super Bowl LVIII was so large that it approached the all-time most watched television broadcast in the United States set in 1969, when an estimated 125 to 150 million viewers  
Super Bowl television ratings and shares, including network (both NBC and CBS televised the first Super Bowl). The rating represents the percentage of televisions tuned in to a program. The share is the percentage of televisions on at the time that watched: 
The first and most obvious of those signs is the household rating, which last year dropped to 36.9 — the lowest for any Super Bowl since 1969. After topping a 40 rating for three-straight decades, the Super Bowl has fallen below that mark in each of the past two years. The decline is largely obscured when looking at the viewership, which in  
Sunday’s Super Bowl was watched by just 91.6 million people on CBS, the lowest number of viewers for the game on traditional broadcast television since 2006. A total of 96.4 million people  
The overnight rating for Super Bowl 53 was a 44.9 nationally on CBS, the lowest since a 42.1 in the 2009 Super Bowl pitting the Pittsburgh Steelers against the Arizona Cardinals, according to a  
Super Bowl ratings hit an eight-year low in the metered markets, but the numbers were not far off the go-go days of recent years. Sunday’s Eagles-Patriots Super Bowl 52 earned a 47.4 overnight rating on NBC, down 2.9% from last year on FOX (Patriots-Falcons: 48.8), down 3.3% from 2016 on CBS (Broncos-Panthers: 49.0), and the lowest for the game since 2010 (Saints-Colts: 46.4). 
An uninteresting Super Bowl hit a ten-year low in the overnight ratings. Sunday’s Patriots-Rams Super Bowl 53 earned a 44.9 overnight rating on CBS, down 5% from Eagles-Patriots on NBC last year (47.4) and down 8% from Patriots-Falcons on FOX in 2017 (48.8). The 44.9 is the lowest Super Bowl overnight in a decade (2009 Steelers-Cardinals: 42.1). 
That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
Might be THE best Super Bowl ad I've ever seen, or at least the most gutsy. You have a silly ass advertisement mascot that everyone loves to hate for the phrase "dilly dilly" get brutally, and I mean BRUTALLY, murdered in front of 100 million television viewers with squishy sounds and everything as The Mountain crushed his head, and that's followed by incinerating the Dilly Dilly Royal Family.
