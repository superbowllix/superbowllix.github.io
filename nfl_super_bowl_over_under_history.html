        <h2><strong>nfl super bowl over under history new orleans super bowl logo 2025 release date</strong></h2>
        <p>The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). There are 12 NFL teams who have never won a Super Bowl: Arizona Cardinals; Atlanta Falcons; Buffalo Bills; Carolina Panthers  
For OVER/UNDER bets, a total point threshold is set, such as the 49.5 total point mark for Super Bowl LIX. Bettors predict whether the combined score of both teams will be OVER or UNDER this number. The UNDER has hit in five of the last six Super Bowls. 
Taking out two pushes and one pick ’em game, favorites are 28-27 (51%) in the game against the spread. The over/under is split exactly down the middle with 29 games going over the total and 29 staying under (Super Bowl I had no over/under odds posted, but one would have to assume it would have gone over with 45 points scored). 
In the 2019 Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. The three points by the Rams matched an all-time low in the big game, matching the Miami Dolphins from way back in Super Bowl VI. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
Favorites are 28-28-2 in the 58 Super Bowls that have been contested. The UNDER is 29-28 in Super Bowl betting history. There was no total posted for Super Bowl 1. This year's Big Game will be a  
The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers opened as a pick 'em for Super Bowl 54 — only the fourth time that has happened in NFL history. Last year, the Patriots and Rams opened as a pick 'em. The Patriots ended up closing as 2-point favorites then winning, 13-3, to give Tom Brady his sixth ring. 
Here's a look at the past Super Bowl Over/Under history: Super Bowl LVI: Under (49.5 – Rams 23, Bengals 20) Super Bowl LV: Under (56 – Buccaneers 31, Chiefs 9) 
Full Super Bowl Betting History. And now, a comprehensive rundown of the betting history for each Super Bowl through Super Bowl LVII. At each step, we’ll log how the favorite has done straight up (SU) and against the spread (ATS), as well as over/under results. Super Bowl I – Super Bowl X. SB I | Packers (-14) 35-10 Chiefs Favorite SU: 1-0  
The longest Over streak was 4, from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXIII The team that has scored first has won 38 of 58 Super Bowls (65.5%) As per Steve Makinen on VSiN.com , "The team with the better record going into the Super Bowl game is 30-20 SU all-time but has lost 12 of the last 14 and is on a 1-16 ATS skid since 2004!" 
Of that sample, the over has hit 9 times (60.0%). Thus, if you do like the over, I wouldn't let the past trends scare you out of it. What's the Highest Total in Super Bowl History? It's okay if you close the tab, Atlanta Falcons fans. I don't want to open old wounds. The highest total in Super Bowl history was the famed 28-3 game against the

The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will compete in the Super Bowl on Sunday, and there has been some subtle line movement. The spread and total were released after the AFC and NFC Championship Games, with Kansas City opening as a slight favorite. 
66.5 percent said no, with most readers suggesting that this trio needs at least two more Super Bowl wins, ideally under 1980's NFL rules and with fewer commercials. 
SportsLine's computer simulation model has locked in a $10 four-leg Super Bowl 59 SGP that pays over $15,000  in NFL history. The Eagles blew out the Washington Commanders, 55-23, to advance to  
The over/under (point total) is set at 48.5 points.  "Kansas City is looking to become the first team in NFL history to win three straight Super Bowl championships. And while the Chiefs have  
Prior to the Chiefs' back-to-back titles over the 49ers and Eagles from 2022-2023, Kansas City also appeared in Super Bowl LIV (2019 season) and Super Bowl LV (2020), vying for consecutive trophies. 
Recent Super Bowl Over/Under History The Under has been the play lately, hitting in four of the last five Super Bowls. Last year’s game between the Chiefs and Eagles was the only one to hit the  
NFL Picks for Super Bowl LIX: Chiefs vs. Eagles for all the marbles Philadelphia Eagles (17-3) vs. Kansas City Chiefs (17-2) Sunday, February 2, 6:30 PM ET (New Orleans, LA) Let's just get this out of the way because people want to know: The Chiefs are favored to win this game by 1.5 points. The over-under for this game has been set at 48.5 points. 
Let's get right into answering that question, analyzing over/under totals throughout Super Bowl history, diving into stat trends from the 2022 season and 2023 playoffs, and evaluating key matchup  </p>
