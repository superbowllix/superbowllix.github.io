        <p>The 1920 Akron Pros were named the first APFA (NFL) champions. The National Football League champions, prior to the merger between the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL) in 1970, were determined by two different systems. The National Football League was established on September 17, 1920, as the American Professional Football Association (APFA). The APFA changed  
The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships  
In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. The first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, so Detroit's championships do not count as Super Bowl  
The Detroit Lions last played a home playoff game on Jan 18, 2025, when they hosted the Commanders in the Divisional Round of the 2024 NFL playoffs, in which the Lions suffered a 31-45 loss. When was the last time the Lions lost a playoff game? 
Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
Detroit Lions NFL championships, pre-Super Bowl era. Despite having never played in the Super Bowl, the Detroit Lions have won an NFL Championship, doing so four times. This was prior to the AFL  
Imagine if we separated Major League Baseball World Series titles the same way that we separate NFL Championships, pre-1966, from Super Bowl titles. The Dodgers have won five MLB crowns in the city of Los Angeles, but only two since the start of the Super Bowl era. (They lost three Series alone in the 1970s — what a disappointment! 
Detroit Lions Playoff History And A Hopeful Future. If you’re a Lions fan, you know the playoff pain all too well. They didn’t even win a postseason game in the Super Bowl era until 1991, when  
4-1 in pre-Super Bowl championships: Detroit does have championship history in football, but it has been 67 years. The Lions won their first championship in 1935 over the New York Giants. 
The Detroit Lions franchise was founded in Portsmouth, Ohio as the Portsmouth Spartans and joined the NFL on July 12, 1930. Amid financial struggles, the team was relocated to Detroit in 1934. The team was also renamed the Lions in reference to the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise, the Tigers. The Lions won four NFL Championship Games between 1935 and 1957, all prior to the Super  
In just a few days, the 59th Super Bowl will take place, and for the 59th consecutive time, it will not feature the Detroit Lions. This year, it felt like the Lions may finally break the streak  
A Detroit Lions fan says StubHub broke the contract after he spent $16,000 on two Super Bowl tickets. 
The first appearance came in 1991 against the Washington Redskins, who smashed Detroit 41-10 on the way to winning the Super Bowl. 4-1 in pre-Super Bowl championships: Detroit does have championship history in football, but it has been 67 years. The Lions won their first championship in 1935 over the New York Giants. 
In that era the wings and tigers were also winning so they called Detroit the city of champions. In the 50s Detroit was the center of the universe because of the auto industry. Believe there was a day they celebrated champions day or something was a Detroit holiday 
Score Detroit Lions gear from Fanatics! Have the Detroit Lions Ever Won the Super Bowl? (The Lions fell short of an SB appearance in the 2023 season. Photo: Junfu Han-USA TODAY Sports) The Detroit Lions have never won the Super Bowl. They also have never played in the Super Bowl. Since 1970, Detroit has only appeared in the NFC Championship  
3. 1953: Detroit Lions 17, Cleveland Browns 16. Perhaps no other two franchises are more associated with ineptitude in the modern NFL than the Lions and Browns. Neither has appeared in a Super Bowl. Along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, they’re the only teams in the Super Bowl era to finish a season without a single win. But during the 1950s  
The Lions have never won the Super Bowl and last won an NFL Championship in 1957 (pre-Super Bowl era). They are the only NFC team to have never played in the Super Bowl. 
However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships, with the last coming in 1957. They are one of 14 teams in NFL history to have won four or more NFL Championships. NFL Championship Wins  
Biletnikoff didn’t sign with the Lions, though, reportedly picking the AFL’s Oakland Raiders because of money. He went on to be Super Bowl 11 MVP. 36: Ten fold. DeMarcus Ware wasn't a Super Bowl MVP, but he could have been with two sacks against the Panthers in Super Bowl 50. Like Biletnikoff, Ware was almost a Lion. 
Of those 12 franchises, only two have appeared in four Super Bowls: the Bills and Vikings. The Falcons, Panthers, and Bengals each have two Super Bowl appearances as well. The Cardinals, Chargers, and Titans have all appeared in one Super Bowl. However, four teams have never even played in the Super Bowl: the Browns, Lions, Texans, and Jaguars. </p>
