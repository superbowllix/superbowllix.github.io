        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl.

In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
What Do Super Bowl Quarterbacks and Presidents Have in Common? After its academic reputation, the success of sports teams and alumni have the biggest impact on the brand appeal of major universities. Applications often surge at once-obscure schools if their football team wins a spot in a bowl or its basketball team makes a deep run in the NCAA

US colleges that have produced both a President and a Super Bowl-winning quarterback. Story by Zeleb.es • 11mo. 1 / 14 
But here’s what the exercise taught me. How many schools have had multiple Super Bowl-winning QBs. It’s amazing how some schools have excelled at producing the triggerman in the 45 Super Bowls. For instance, six of the first eight Super Bowls and seven of the first 11 were won by quarterbacks from Alabama or Purdue. 
Other schools that have yielded presidents and Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks: University of Michigan (Gerald Ford and Tom Brady): Brady led the New England Patriots to a record six Super Bowl  
Bradshaw threw for 300-plus yards in half his Super Bowls which, in the 1970s, was the quarterback equivalent of going to the moon (Super Bowl XII, in 1978, featured 217 total net passing yards). 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season.

Trivia timeout: Can you name the four schools that have produced a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and a U.S. president?  Didn't think so, but that's about to change  The answers: The U.S  
It was the first time Super Bowl Sunday occurred in February as the NFL had rescheduled a week of games after the September 11 attacks. Former President Bush was accompanied by Dallas Cowboys quarterback alum, Roger Staubach. THREE: Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration marked the first time Super Bowl Sunday coincided with Inauguration Day  
As someone who (probably) will suspend my myriad objections and watch Sunday’s Super Bowl, I now have a rooting interest. In fact, something like a 45-42 final score, with both quarterbacks accounting for six touchdowns, would do just fine. 
President Donald Trump’s appearance at Sunday’s Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans will go down in history as the first sitting commander-in-chief to attend the National Football League’s title
