These Super Bowl rings’ designs have become progressively exquisite, featuring a one-carat diamond at the outset but comprising over 250 10.5-carat diamonds and 36 rubies at the last Super Bowl.

A Super Bowl ring's value varies based on factors like design, materials, and the player's or coach's status. Typically, the cost of making one range from $30,000 to $50,000. However, rings on the open market can fetch significantly higher prices, with some sold for over $500,000. 
The other side of the ring has the Super Bowl LVI final score 23-20, the NFL Shield and Super Bowl LVI logo, and “WORLD CHAMPIONS” on a plate that mimics the shape of the Infinity Screen. The two diamonds on each side of the ring, totaling four stones, represent the four teams the Rams beat in the 2021 Postseason to win Super Bowl LVI. 
A Super Bowl LI ring made for a family member of Tom Brady fetched a record-breaking $344,927 at auction despite having fewer diamonds and being smaller than Brady’s ring. Even before considering the sentimental significance, these rings are costly !
