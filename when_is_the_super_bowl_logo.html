        <h2><strong>when is the super bowl logo super bowl game on now</strong></h2>
        <p>The first Super Bowl did not have a logo, but each championship game since then has featured one. Super Bowl 2 through Super Bowl 44 (1968-2010) featured a logo that often included a nod to the  
The 2025 Super Bowl logo reflects the character of New Orleans, chosen as the match’s host city. The design conveys the city’s festive atmosphere, known for its lively festivals and unique Mardi Gras Indian traditions. 
For the first time ever, the NFL collaborated with a local artist on the creation of a Super Bowl logo. The artist who created our new logo, Tahj Williams, is the queen of her Black Masking Indian tribe in New Orleans, the home of Super Bowl LIX. 
Before Super XLIV took place in Miami in February 2010, the NFL and the North Texas Super Bowl Committee unveiled the logo for the ensuing Super Bowl that would take place in Arlington, Texas. 
During a press conference in Las Vegas, the NFL showed off the new logo, which is full of bright colors -- exactly what you'd expect for a Super Bowl in New Orleans. 
The NFL has unveiled the official logo for Super Bowl LIX, which will take place on February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. This year’s logo is a stunning tribute to the vibrant culture and traditions of its host city, offering a fresh take on how the NFL honors its Super Bowl locations. 
From 1967's Super Bowl II until 2009's Super Bowl XLIV, the game's logo included various colors, fonts and designs. In its earliest days, red, white and blue dominated -- until the early 1990s. 
New Orleans will host the next Super Bowl inside the Caesars Superdome on Feb. 9, 2025. On Monday, the NFL revealed the event's logo. Per a video shared by the league, local artist Tahj 
When did unique Super Bowl logos begin? The first major change to the Super Bowl logo began in 1987 for Super Bowl XXI between the New York Giants and Denver Broncos. That game was held at 
The NFL has officially unveiled the logo for Super Bowl LVIII, which will be held at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on Feb. 11, 2024. 
Super Bowl Logo 2021. The Super Bowl 2021 logo resembles the 2020 emblem because it uses two accent colors. However, while the Roman numerals previously emitted a warm yellow glow, they now evoke a sense of coldness due to the blue gradient. The gradient shift appears dynamic thanks to the contrast between the light top and the dark bottom. 
A massive golden “50” appeared on the 2016 Super Bowl logo (the league wasn’t into “Super Bowl L”), then the NFL switched to the layout it has used ever since, with numerals flanking both sides of the Lombardi Trophy, with a mostly or partially silver design. 
The logo for Super Bowl LIX, which combines the Lombardi Trophy and Roman numerals with shades of red and green and a design inspired by the wrought-iron balconies in the French Quarter, has been  
Bold and streamlined, the logo features ‘SUPER BOWL XXIII’ in a strong red font, accompanied by graphic elements resembling goal posts. XXIV (1990) Elegance is key in this diamond-shaped design with a blue border and ‘SUPER BOWL XXIV’ in red and white, offering a nod to tradition. 
The 2025 Super Bowl logo features red and green. Both colors correspond with the teams playing in the NFL championship game — the Chiefs and Eagles.. Considering this is the third time in four  
“I come from a great and beautiful culture, and I want the world to see it the same way as I do,” said Williams, 26, who is the first person to handcraft both the Super Bowl logo and theme art. 
The Super Bowl logo theory posits that the teams that would play in the big game on Feb. 9 were predicted by the colors in the logo. While it's likely just a conspiracy, this year's logo colors do  
Super Bowl XXXIX’s logo prominently featured the Dames Point Bridge, an iconic structure in Jacksonville, Fla. These logos continued until 2010, when the NFL shifted its design philosophy again. 
The 1969 Super Bowl was the third iteration of the championship tournament, and the first to bear the trademarked “Super Bowl” name. Going for an all-American red, white, and blue motif, the design featured the wordmark in two lines, with the word “SUPER” in the top line colored red, and the bottom “BOWL III” colored blue. 
From 1967's Super Bowl II until 2009's Super Bowl XLIV, the game's logo included various colors, fonts and designs. In its earliest days, red, white and blue dominated -- until the early 1990s. </p>
