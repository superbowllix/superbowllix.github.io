What Has More Viewers: Super Bowl or Champions League Final? Champions League final vs. Super Bowl viewership reaches into the hundreds of millions, easily, for both games! Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, which ended as a 25-22 overtime win for the Chiefs, was the most-watched telecast in US history. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl ‚Äî and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
The Champions League final has generally averaged around 400 million viewers for the last five years with the 2021 Champions League Final between Chelsea and Manchester City being the most viewed event in the competition‚Äôs history with around 700 million viewers. Super Bowl, on the other hand, had failed to break the 100-million mark for the  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
The 2023 Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles set a domestic viewership record with 115.1 million viewers across Fox, Fox Deportes and other digital streams. 
I used average viewership data from Wild Card Round, Divisional Round, Conference Championship, and Super Bowl games played between 2021 and 2025 (representing the 2020-2024 regular seasons) to  
Moreover, the Champions League final is widely reported to generate 700 million viewers while, according to FC Business, a recent El Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid attracted 650 million  
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl ‚Äî and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
Champions League has a bigger viewership when its two popular teams like Real Madrid, Man U, Barcelonaetc, but when its Inter vs. Bayern or some of these smaller teams then the Super Bowl wins. Reply reply 
The Champions League has also now incorporated a Super Bowl-esque showbiz element with on-field musical performances before kick-off. So, while the Super Bowl is, and likely will always be, the king of US sports, the wider sporting world pays much more attention to the Champions League final. Super Bowl vs Champions League final: Who wins? 
The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
In the world of sports entertainment, two events stand out for their ability to draw massive global audiences: the Super Bowl, the championship game of American professional football, and the UEFA Champions League final, the culmination of European club football. 
Combined Twitter Following: 25.5M (Champions League) vs. 2.22M (Super Bowl) Champions League has over 10x the number of Twitter followers but only third of the total tweets.

The Super Bowl versus the FIFA World Cup: two colossal events that captivate the globe, each with its own fervent following. In this video, we dive deep into 
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
The 2021 Champions League final brought in 700 million viewers compared to the 2022 Super Bowl‚Äôs 112 million. Al-Khelaifi highlighted that the U.S. and Super Bowl have a mindset of ‚Äú creativity and entertainment ‚Äù when it comes to the event and suggested the Champions League do the same. 
[Meirov] Numbers are in: Super Bowl LVI featuring the Rams and Bengals was watched by 112.3 million viewers across all platforms. That‚Äôs up 14% over last year‚Äôs Super Bowl. The NFL finishes a strong season with another massive number. What a year.üèà üëë </p>
