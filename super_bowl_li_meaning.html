        <p>Super Bowl LI was an American football game played at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on February 5, 2017, [9] [10] to determine the champion of the National Football  
The 2015 Carolina Panthers were spared the indignity of having been known as Super Bowl L's losing team, and the traditional nomenclature was restored the next year with Super Bowl LI. 
Super Bowl LI (meaning Super Bowl 51 in Roman numerals) was an American football game in which the New England Patriots, winners of the American Football Conference (AFC) for the 2016 season, beat the Atlanta Falcons, winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) for the 2016 season, 34-28 to become winners of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2016 season. 
The name “Super Bowl” was officially adopted for the third annual game and the league retroactively added Roman numerals to the Super Bowls before 1971. What Super Bowl did not use Roman numerals? There is one exception to the Roman numeral rule in the Super Bowl era. Super Bowl 50 — which featured the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers  
The league returned to Roman numerals for Super Bowl 51 (LI). Seriously, why does the NFL still do this? I don't know. It's pretty dumb! Jordan Greer. 
Once you understand their meaning, Super Bowls — and other basic math problems — are much easier to understand:  The league returned to Roman numerals for Super Bowl 51 (LI) and has kept  
The Super Bowl is set for Feb. 9 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans, LA.. This year's Super Bowl will be Super Bowl LIX, otherwise known as Super Bowl 59. The  
In the Super Bowl era, there’s one exception to the Roman numeral rule: Super Bowl 50 decided the champion of the 2015 season, with the Denver Broncos defeating the Carolina Panthers 24-10. “50" in Roman numerals is denoted simply as “L”, not exactly a positive symbol in modern culture (think of the lyrics to Smash Mouth’s 1999  
The Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX on February 9. The NFL uses Roman numerals to mark Super Bowls, a tradition started in 1971 by Lamar Hunt to avoid confusion from the season spanning two calendar years. Apart from one Super Bowl, Roman numerals have been consistently used since. 
The longest Super Bowl by elapsed time from kickoff to end of the game, was 4 hours and 14 minutes — 254 minutes — in Super Bowl XLVII between the 49ers and Baltimore Ravens. That's due to a  
Super Bowl LI will go down as one of the best title games in NFL history. The New England Patriots overcame a 25-point third-quarter deficit to knock off the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in the first  
Super Bowl LII (meaning Super Bowl 52 in Roman numerals) was an American football game in which the Philadelphia Eagles, who were winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the 2017 season, beat the New England Patriots, who were winners of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the 2017 season, 41-33 to become winners of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2017 season. 
The next championship game was called "Super Bowl LI," and presumably, the NFL will continue to use that naming system (until it finds another reason not to). 
The Patriots' victory was their fifth, moving them into a three-way tie with the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl wins. After finishing the regular season with a league-best 14–2 record, New England advanced to their record-setting ninth Super Bowl appearance and their seventh under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. 
Kendrick Lamar’s 2025 Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show is set to be a high-energy, thought-provoking spectacle, featuring a combination of his classic hits and new material. 
Super Bowl LI will be his 36th playoff game, matching Tom Landry and Don Shula for the most all-time by a head coach. This is a big game for Matty Ice's legacy, as well. A win would make him the first quarterback to lead the league in Approximate Value and win the Super Bowl in the same season since Steve Young in 1994. While Manning, Rodgers  
In Super Bowl LI, the first Super Bowl to end in overtime, [112] the Atlanta Falcons led 28–3 late in the third quarter, but the Patriots came back to tie the game 28–28 with back-to-back touchdowns and two-point conversions, and the Patriots went on to win 34–28 in overtime. [113]

The National Football League’s (NFL) forthcoming championship game, Super Bowl LIX, is set for February 9, 2025. This will be the 59th Super Bowl in NFL history. The event will occur at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.
