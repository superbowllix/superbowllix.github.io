        <p>Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
Jim Kelly started four Super Bowls without winning any, a record. He's one of eight quarterbacks who have started at least four Super Bowls. Super Bowl wins are often used to determine the greatness of a quarterback. [1] Of the eligible players, only Jim Plunkett has won multiple Super Bowls and not been inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
The most Super Bowl wins as a starting quarterback belong to Tom Terrific and his seven victories in the NFL title game (Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, LIII, and LV). He was the MVP of the biggest game five times. Conclusion. That is quite an impressive list of stars, but like they say, ” The Cream rises to the top.” 
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
In his Super Bowl career, the six-time champion has the most starts (10) and wins (6) as a quarterback. He also holds the most career passing yards (2,838) and career passing touchdowns (18) in  
33 players are tied for the most wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 1 win. The first three are Patrick Mahomes on February 11, 2024, on February 12, 2023 and on February 2, 2020, Matthew Stafford on February 13, 2022 and Tom Brady 7 times. 
Led by QB Terry Bradshaw, FB Franco Harris, DT "Mean" Joe Greene, WR Lynn Swann and CB Mel Blount, Pittsburgh won Super Bowl 9, Super Bowl 10, Super Bowl 13 and Super Bowl 14, bringing a quartet  
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
Peyton Manning is the only starting quarterback to win Super Bowls with two different teams. He took the Indianapolis Colts to two Super Bowls and won his first in 2007 before taking his talents  
Quarterbacks With the Most Super Bowl Wins. Tom Brady – 7 Wins; Yes, the greatest QB of all time obviously holds the record for the most Super Bowl wins by a quarterback. Tom Brady, who won a majority of his Lombardi Trophies with the New England Patriots, holds a substantial lead over all others at his position. 
A fourth Super Bowl win would tie Mahomes with Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the second-most Super Bowl wins by a quarterback. Mahomes' 17 postseason wins are already the  
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles  
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
At present, he is one of eight NFL starting quarterbacks to win back-to-back Super Bowls. Below is the full list to accomplish that feat: Bart Starr, Green Bay Packers (Super Bowls 1 and 2) 
Manning has two Super Bowl wins. The Giants won Super Bowl 42 over the Patriots during the 2007-08 season, and they also won Super Bowl 46 over the Patriots during the 2011-12 season with Manning  
Tom Brady’s seven Super Bowl wins are the most among any quarterbacks — and all players — in NFL history. Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana are both tied for second all-time among starting quarterbacks with four Super Bowl victories. With Brady’s retirement, Patrick Mahomes is the active leader for most Super Bowls among quarterbacks. 
In 2023, the Chiefs reached the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, securing Mahomes his second Lombardi Trophy. Currently positioned as the primary contender to Tom Brady’s seven titles, Mahomes has an opportunity to win his third Super Bowl on February 11, 2024, when the Chiefs take on San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII.
