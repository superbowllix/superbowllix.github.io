        <p>Although the league does not pay appearance fees for Super Bowl halftime performers, the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to make a donation of $100,000 to Jackson's Heal the World Foundation, and provide commercial time during the game for the foundation's Heal L.A. campaign, which aimed to provide health care, drug education, and mentorship for Los  
Super Bowl organizers have more often selected country stars to sing the National Anthem (or, occasionally, "America the Beautiful") before the game's kickoff. 
TIL in 1994, country music singer Alan Jackson was asked to use a pre-recorded version of his song 'Gone Country' when performing live at the award show. He protested by having his drummer perform with no drum sticks in his hand the whole performance 
Alan Eugene Jackson (born October 17, 1958) is an American country music singer-songwriter. He is known for performing a style widely regarded as "neotraditional country", as well as writing many of his own songs. Jackson has recorded 21 studio albums, including two Christmas albums, and two gospel albums, as well as three greatest-hits albums.

Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers played with his bass unplugged at the super bowl. 
Jackson, who was up for Male Vocalist of the Year, was scheduled to perform his then-current single “Pop a Top.” And he did perform his own songbefore abruptly stopping after the first chorus and breaking into “Choices.” It was a clear middle finger to the CMA Awards for disrespecting George Jones, and it was one that meant a lot to Jones himself. 
A comprehensive listing of Alan Jackson's musical accomplishments over the course of his career 
Those images have provided the origins for some of Jackson's biggest hits--songs such as "Livin' on Love," "Home" and "Chattahoochee." They're memories so vivid that they remain a source of inspiration on his latest album, Thirty Miles West. 
The Jackson Family Tragedy. In September, Alan Jackson and his family had their worlds turned upside down when Alan’s son-in-law, Ben Selecman, slipped and fell on a boat dock in Florida. He was unable to recover from his injuries, and passed away on September 12.
