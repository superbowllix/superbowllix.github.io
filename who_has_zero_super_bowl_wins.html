        <p>Cleveland Browns (Zero Super Bowl appearances) (AP Photo/Mark Duncan) The Browns lost a few heart-breaking AFC title games to John Elway and the Broncos in the 1980s but hey, they did get their  
The Vikings are easily the most successful team on this list: Their 54.5% win percentage in the regular season ranks eighth all-time, and their four Super Bowl appearances are tied for the 13th  
Cleveland Browns. The Browns won four NFL championships pre-merger (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964), but have never won a Super Bowl. Cleveland’s 1964 championship was the city’s most recent title  
In two appearances, Atlanta fell short in Super Bowl 33 and lost more famously in Super Bowl 51. The New England Patriots would win that game after the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead. 
The Chiefs and Eagles have not only been on this stage before, but have won a Super Bowl in the last six years. Super Bowl 57 will be Kansas City's fifth appearance, with two wins under their belt  
Twelve years later, Peyton Manning led the Broncos to a 24-10 win over the 15-1 Panthers in Super Bowl 50-- his second Super Bowl victory and the final game of his storied career. Despite those  
Oldest NFL team without a Super Bowl win. No franchise has been held without a Super Bowl win longer than the Cardinals, who have existed in some capacity as an NFL franchise since 1920, picked up  
Oldest NFL Team Without A Super Bowl Win. The Cardinals are the oldest NFL team without a Super Bowl win. The franchise has been in the NFL in some form since 1920, yet they have never held the Lombardi Trophy. Twenty years before the Super Bowl era got underway, Arizona won an NFL title in 1947. 
Minnesota Vikings (4 SB appearances): The Vikings have finished with double-digit wins 21 times since 1967 and appeared in four Super Bowls, but the team has also lost six conference championship  
The Lions are one of the NFL's oldest franchises (founded in 1930), yet they have zero Super Bowl appearances and arguably the worst postseason résumé in league history. That's why their 2023  
8 teams are tied for the fewest wins in Super Bowls, with 0 wins. The first three are the Arizona Cardinals, the Carolina Panthers and the Tennessee Titans. 
Teams that have played in three Super Bowls. The Cincinnati Bengals are the only team to have played in three Super Bowls but have come back empty-handed on each occasion. Each of their three  
Super Bowl wins: Four (Super Bowls 4, 54, 57 and 58) Most recent Super Bowl appearance: Super Bowl 58 (defeated 49ers, 25-22, in overtime) Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl history. 
Super Bowl champions by year. 1967 Super Bowl (1): Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 1968 Super Bowl (2): Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14 1969 Super Bowl (3): New York Jets 16  
2. Pro Bowl highlights: NFC off to hot start thanks to Jared Goff. The Pro Bowl is a two-day event this year and after the first night of action, the NFC is absolutely dominating. 
The Lions are one of the NFL's oldest franchises (founded in 1930), yet they have zero Super Bowl appearances and arguably the worst postseason résumé in league history. That's why their 2023  
The Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years. Eight franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls, one of which (Pittsburgh) has accomplished it twice: Green Bay Packers (Super Bowls I and II) Miami Dolphins (VII and VIII) Pittsburgh Steelers (twice: IX and X; XIII and XIV) 
The Green Bay Packers have 4 wins in Super Bowls all-time. 
Super Bowl LIX will take place at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, the type of venue in which Mahomes historically thrives.  15 wins and zero losses in domed or closed roof stadiums. 
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. </p>
