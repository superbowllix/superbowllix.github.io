Keys, of course, was the first guest

Featuring 70,000 hematite crystals, the guitar successfully reflected the dazzling and vibrant celebration of Latin music and showmanship. 
Predicting Kendrick Lamar’s First Song at the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show At 37, Kendrick Lamar steps onto the Super Bowl halftime stage as an artist and a cultural force.

Prince (2007) For Super Bowl XLI, the Indianapolis Colts and the Chicago Bears braved the pouring rain and driving winds (Colts won 29-17). But Prince fought those same elements while playing a live electric guitar, a pretty metal move considering water and electricity are a dangerous combination.
