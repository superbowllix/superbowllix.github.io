        <h2><strong>super bowl vegan ad super bowl odds list</strong></h2>
        <p>Here are four vegan-friendly brands airing this Sunday (plus, one ad you definitely won’t see). Every year, millions of viewers tune in to watch the Super Bowl, making it one of the most-watched television events in the world. 
As football fans are prepping for their game day halftime parties, PETA’s joining the “chicken wars” with “Fight the Bite,” a new Super Bowl commercial depicting chickens fighting back to remind those who would eat them that they’re sentient individuals—not a halftime snack. 
Edie Falco wants you to consider topping your nachos with vegan cheese this Super Bowl Sunday. The Sopranos star and longtime animal activist is starring in an intense new Super Bowl ad for 
Carl's Jr.'s upcoming Super Bowl ad features the plant-based Beyond Meat patty, marking the first time vegan meat will appear in a Big Game commercial. 
Some of the most iconic Super Bowl commercials are from Coca-Cola, Budweiser, and Doritos. In anticipation of the Super Bowl, VeganMed has compiled a list of our Top 16 favorite vegan advertisements. 
PETA’s ad features a bevy of beauties who are unable to resist the powers of veggie love. Watch the video that was deemed too hot for Super Bowl XLIII! Learn More. 
Carl’s Jr.’s commercial for the Beyond Famous Star will air during the Super Bowl on Sunday in the Los Angeles area—marking the first time that a plant-based burger advertisement has been featured during the big game. 
If you were watching the game only for the commercials (guilty) and are in the Los Angeles area, you probably caught this one. Carl’s Jr. launched a commercial promoting its new Beyond Famous Star burger, the first time that a plant-based burger was featured in a Super Bowl ad. 
Kevin Bacon's six degrees of separation theory just got a little tighter now that the actor and musician is appearing in a new Super Bowl LIX ad alongside a star-studded cast of characters. 
Swedish vegan brand Oatly aired its first television commercial in the United States during Super Bowl 55 this Sunday. The 30-second commercial featured Oatly CEO Toni Petersson playing a keyboard and singing a short jingle with lyrics “it’s like milk but made for humans” and “wow, no cow.” 
It's one thing to make vegan dinner recipes or vegan breakfast recipes; it's another level of difficulty entirely when hosting holiday meals or parties like the Super Bowl. If you're trying to make a spread that everyone can enjoy, make sure to include a few items for folks with dietary restrictions. 
Vegan Super Bowl Snack Ideas. The high energy that accompanies Superbowl Sunday needs to be fueled with vegan super bowl foods. Some classics that I feel always need to be a part of the Superbowl food spread are vegan Superbowl dips, chili, wings and other Superbowl snacks. Here’s a list of 30+ vegan Superbowl snack ideas to make! 
ADWEEK's Super Bowl 59 Ad Tracker monitors all the advertisers in this year's Big Game. ADWEEK; NFL

“It cost a fraction of what the catering budget is for almost every other spot in the Super Bowl.” Air time during the Super Bowl typically costs around $5.5 million per 30 seconds. But the seven-year-old ad was produced by the company with minimal expenses over just a few days. 
A commercial aiming to disparage plant-based meat ran locally in the Washington, DC area during this year’s Super Bowl, sparking backlash from several groups. The 60-second commercial—created by a group that calls itself “The Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF)”—features young spelling bee contestants attempting to spell ingredients in “synthetic” meats. 
While we're all about the game (go Taylor’s boyfriend), commercials, and halftime show, we get most hyped about the Super Bowl party menu—that's right, we're shamelessly here for the food!
