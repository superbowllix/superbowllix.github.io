Which city has hosted the Super Bowl the most times? Miami has hosted the NFL's championship game the joint most times, along with 2025 host New Orleans. 
The city of New Orleans will be the host for the 2024 Super Bowl, after stating their case to the NFL as being worthy of having the league’s title game in the Big Easy. 
New Orleans will be hosting its 11th Super Bowl, tied with Miami for the most Super Bowl hosting appearances. The city hosted the Super Bowl four times in the 1970s, twice in the 1980s and twice  
This is the 11th time New Orleans has hosted a Super Bowl. The last time was in 2013. The Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation said that event brought in roughly $480 million. 
With Super Bowl XLVII, New Orleans ties Miami for the most prolific Super Bowl Host City, at 10 each.
