        <p>The home-field curse is said to affect a team if the Super Bowl is played at its home stadium. As of 2024, only two teams have played the Super Bowl in their stadiums, the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs for Super Bowl LV and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams against the Cincinnati Bengals for Super Bowl LVI at their new home, SoFi Stadium; both host

If the Chiefs beat the Eagles in Super Bowl LVII on Sunday night, Mahomes will end a 56-year QB curse, and the curse is pretty simple: No quarterback has ever led the league in passing yards AND  
I created a similar thread regarding this topic earlier, but I unfortunately left out the phrasing "Last 16 Quarterbacks", so people got furious about it since John Elway, Len Dawson, Jim Kelly, Bob Griese, Craig Morton, and Fran Tarkenton have made it back to the Super Bowl after losing their debut Super Bowl appearance, but I wasn't referring to those guys as that was over 2 decades ago, and
