        <h2><strong>daytona 500 vs super bowl viewers super bowl time free live stream</strong></h2>
        <p>NASCAR's average viewership was up 1% from a year ago, which they call good news since several races were swamped by rain delays. Daytona 500 led. 
How many people watch the Daytona 500? In 2024, the race was watched by nearly six million viewers. 
The Super Bowl debuted in 1967, with an impressive 51 million viewers. As decades passed, both events grew in stature and viewing numbers. By 2006, the Daytona 500 saw 19.4 million viewers, showing NASCAR’s rising prominence. However, the Super Bowl remained the pinnacle of American sports viewership, although NASCAR effectively collaborated  
For only the fourth time in the event's 51 years, the Daytona 500 failed to reach 200 laps. The other times were: 1965 when Fred Lorenzen won in 129 laps (322.5 miles), 1966 when Richard Petty won  
The rain-delayed 2021 Daytona 500 had a 2.8 rating and 4.83 million viewers, marking the lowest rated and least-watched edition of the race. As recently as 2013, when Danica Patrick competed in the race for the first time, the 500 had a 9.9 and 16.7 million. Daytona 500 ratings, viewership. 1979-2004 numbers from Sports Business Daily 2.16.2005 
For example, in 2006, the Daytona 500 attracted 19.4 million viewers, which wasn’t far off from Super Bowl XLI’s 93 million viewers in terms of addressable market. 
Daytona 500 viewership. Last year's Daytona 500 was delayed nearly six hours due to rain, while the 2020 race ended on a Monday, averaging just over seven million viewers.  With Super Bowl LIX  
Viewership Grows for Second Straight Year. No race on the NASCAR calendar commands as much attention as the Daytona 500. Three months removed from the previous season’s finale and hosted at an iconic venue in the city where the sport began, The Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing annually delivers the sport’s highest viewership figures. 
Within motorsports, the Daytona 500 audience is still nearly double what the Indianapolis 500 gets, and nearly 4x what the best F1 races have ever done on U.S. airwaves. On Saturday, FS1 drew 1.7 million viewers for the NASCAR Xfinity Series race from Daytona, up 14% from 2022. 
Analytically, the Super Bowl and the Daytona 500 are not merely sporting events but cultural phenomena that draw millions of viewers and generate substantial economic impact. The Super Bowl, perhaps the bigger draw in terms of global viewership, may overshadow NASCAR’s premier event, which has always enjoyed the spotlight of an exclusive  
So you think the Super Bowl is bigger than the Daytona 500? Think again. There were 74,059 fans in the Miami stands. More than 200,000 will jam Daytona International Speedway 
The Daytona 500 is among the most prestigious events in motorsports, along with the Indianapolis 500, Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. According to Nielsen Sports’ SponsorLink, the race ranks among America’s top 10 “can’t miss” sports events, along with the Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals and the Olympics. 
Daytona 500 vs Super Bowl Popularity. The Daytona 500 has long served as NASCAR’s premier event. And it’s no surprise that it has brought in tens of millions of viewers throughout its history. While the Super Bowl is commonly among the most watched television shows in history, it’s logical to speculate whether the Daytona 500 compares  
• The race averaged 11.922 million viewers on FOX, up +5% over 2016’s average audience of 11.357 million, peaking at 14.031 million viewers from 6:15-6:30 PM ET • The DAYTONA 500 scored a 6.6/15 HH rating, which is flat overall compared to the 2016 edition but delivers positive gains across key male and adult demographics 
Ummm Daytona 500 is on perfect weekend between Super Bowl and ncaa basketball tournament and is seen as opening event of season. It’s perfect sports weekend in winter to attract eyeballs. The 500 competes with baseball, nba, nascar, f1, family bbqs, Memorial Day events, etc. hard to compare the two for viewership 
Is NASCAR worried about a future Super Bowl stepping on the Daytona 500? Yes and no. How’s that for an answer? Sometime soon, the NFL is likely to expand to a 17-game season, and depending on  
There's no bigger race for a NASCAR driver to win than the Daytona 500. But it's one of the most random and chaotic events on the calendar. 
It is the most high profile event in Nascar. It’s also why Nascar seems so out of touch the rest of the year IMO. They try and make every race as big as this and while it’s not the only reason, I would say it’s fed into the manufacturing of drama that the playoffs/Chase systems have brought about. 
The best data we could find shows that in 2008, a 30-second spot during the Daytona 500 cost $550,000, and even if that doubled over the last ten years it still wouldn’t even come close to Super Bowl numbers. The NFL’s Super Bowl is the clear winner over every other championship game that’s being played. 
World Series is slightly down over time. Super Bowl still gets over 100M viewers. NCAA Tournament still gets insane ratings. The Daytona 500 gets beat by midlevel college football games now. Shit it gets beat by the Indy 500 almost and that hasn't been a thing for 20 years. </p>
