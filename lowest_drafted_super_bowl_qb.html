At present, Brad Johnson is the lowest-drafted starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl. Johnson started Super Bowl 37 for the Buccaneers, a 48-21 win over the Raiders during which he completed 18

Selected with the last pick in the seventh and final round, No. 262 overall, Purdy will make history as the lowest-drafted quarterback to start in the Super Bowl. 
36 players are tied for the fewest career wins by a quarterback in wins Super Bowls, with 1 win. The first three are Matthew Stafford, Nick Foles and Tarvaris Jackson. 
Regardless of the outcome of the game, Purdy will make history as the lowest-drafted quarterback to start in a Super Bowl. Purdy was selected as the final pick in the 2022 NFL Draft (No. 262). 
Lowest-drafted QB to start Super Bowl. You may have heard this before, but Purdy was the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft. He'd be the lowest-drafted QB to ever start a Super Bowl (262nd overall). 
They did, and now the 49ers will go for a sixth Super Bowl victory, which would tie them with the Steelers and Patriots for the most in history. Meanwhile, Purdy will become the lowest-drafted quarterback to ever start a Super Bowl, and the third-youngest QB to start in a Super Bowl, according to CBS Sports . 
Dolphins quarterback Skylar Thompson was the 247th overall pick in the 2022 NFL draft, and 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy was Mr. Irrelevant at No. 262. They both went late in the seventh round, and they were the last two quarterbacks off the board. They’re also now going to be the two lowest-drafted rookie quarterbacks to start in the playoffs. 
Purdy was the 262nd overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, so if his 49ers can beat the Chiefs in Super Bowl 58, he would officially pass Johnson as the lowest-drafted starting quarterback to win an  
The quarterback gets plenty of blame when a team loses the Super Bowl. On the other side, the signal-callers get plenty of love when their team wins the NFL championship. Who have been the winning QBs in Super Bowls through the years? And what round of the draft were they chosen? 
When both Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo went down with season-ending injuries in the middle of the season, San Francisco 49ers fans likely gave up on their Super Bowl dreams. The only QB option remaining on the roster was Brock Purdy, the rookie from Iowa State who was the very last pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. 
This is a small club and it includes two brothers. With Alex Smith’s retirement now official, he joins a group of quarterbacks selected No. 1 overall without a Super Bowl ring—a list that includes big names like Cam Newton, Matthew Stafford and Michael Vick. 
In his second season in the league, Purdy will take home $934,000 and will be the fifth-lowest-paid player in the Super Bowl on Sunday. Purdy's salary will remain amongst the lowest in the NFL until after the 2024 season, after he was selected with the final selection of the 2022 NFL Draft.

Brock Purdy will be the first Mr. Irrelevant — the last player selected in the NFL draft — to start at quarterback in a Super Bowl.. But the San Francisco 49ers second-year QB is far from the  
On game day, Purdy will become the lowest-drafted QB to ever start a Super Bowl. The 49ers were knocking on the Super Bowl door last year but lost the NFC Championship game in a blowout to the Philadelphia Eagles — a game in which Purdy suffered a serious, first-quarter injury. </p>
