        <h2><strong>super bowl ticket prices year by year super bowl commercials compilation</strong></h2>
        <p>Here is a list of every Super Bowl game along with its ticket prices throughout the years. Super Bowl I — Jan. 5, 1967. Ticket cost: $10 Adjusted for inflation: $90.21 Result – Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs -10 Stadium – Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles MVP – Bart Starr. Super Bowl II — Jan. 14, 1968 
GOBankingRates found the Cost of Attending Every Super Bowl Every Year Since 1967 by using TicketCity’s Super Bowl Statistics, including its Archive of Super Bowl Ticket stubs dating back to the first ever Super Bowl in 1967. Note, this is not the average ticket price per year, but simply the cost of one ticket to enter the stadium. 
Tickets to Super Bowl LVI are officially the most expensive in NFL history. Here's a historical look at the prices from the past big games. 
With an average price of over $12,000, Super Bowl LVIII is poised to break the record for the most expensive Super Bowl ticket prices ever. In its nascent years, the Super Bowl was a relatively modest affair, with tickets for the inaugural game priced at a mere $12 — a fraction of what they are today. 
Super Bowl ticket prices have come a long way since the first game when it was $12 when the Green Bay Packeers played the Kansas City Chiefs. They have risen through the years and when they hit

Here's how Super Bowl 59 ticket prices compare to past years, with costs rising dramatically from $12 in 1967 to over $4,800 in 2025. 
Super Bowl 55’s limited seating created a supply-demand battle for the other 14,500 tickets, with an estimated average face value of each paid ticket to be around $5,950. But that failed in comparison to Super Bowl 56 in Los Angeles, where the average price skyrocketed, stretching to nearly $8,900. 
While the first Super Bowl tickets sold for a mere $12, high demand for attendance to the big game has blown up ticket prices over the years. Super Bowl ticket prices over the past 45 years Early years. 1967-1974: $12-$15 per ticket; In today’s currency: $78-$99; 1975-1983. $20-$40 per ticket; In today’s currency: $84-$118; 1984-1989. $60  
MORE: How Much Are Super Bowl Tickets in 2023? By 1995, the average price had doubled in just seven years to $200 ($374 inflation adj.), which then doubled again in another seven years to $400 ($635 inflation adj.) in 2002. In 2009, the average Super Bowl ticket price finally shattered the $1,000 mark, and it wasn’t slowing down.
