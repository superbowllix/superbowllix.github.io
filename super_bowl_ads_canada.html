        <p>The real estate sales site is teasing a Super Bowl ad where there’s a thing they just can’t say. Canadian comic actor Dan Levy features with SNL’s Heidi Gardner in the teasers and commercial. 
You could watch the 2024 Super Bowl in Canada with or without cable but couldn't see American Super Bowl commercials during the game. Whether you watched the Super Bowl live or are catching up on  
Has Canada Ever Shown U.S. Super Bowl Commercials? Canadians were able to watch American commercials between 2016 and 2018. A Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) policy had banned broadcasters (such as CTV and TSN) from replacing U.S. ads with Canadian ones (also called simultaneous substitution or “simsub”). 
Molson Coors is investing in a Canada-specific Super Bowl ad for the first time that features the “chill train.” The full spot dropped on Monday. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. 
Now that the Super Bowl is finished, the Kelce brothers and Taylor Swift have (maybe) finished celebrating and the Usher halftime show has been fully processed, there’s one last thing for Canadians to catch up on: the ads. Super Bowl ads have become more than sales pitches. 
Jokes aside, we’re excited for this year’s Super Bowl not just because of the major face-off but because of the commercials we get to watch in between.

This pressure led to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) deciding in 2015 to end the practice of simultaneous substitution for the Super Bowl, effectively letting Canadians see the same stream as  
Super Bowl LVII had many commercials that played during the event. Here is some from north of the border. Canada during the event shows many of the US commer 
Crypto ads dominated the Super Bowl scene last year, but much like the dot-com boom and bust at the dawn of the millennium, increasingly cautious cryptocurrency companies are backing away from big  
Toyota is bridging the gap between the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics with an ad that tells a broader story about mobility. As reported in strategy , the new spot is the latest in the company’s global “Start Your Impossible” campaign, which first launched in 2018, and it features a pair of Canadian Paralympians: Brian and Robin McKeever. 
FedEx came oh-so-close to nailing the perfect Super Bowl commercial with their "10 Things" ad, but lost points because the "cute kid" is actually not that cute at all. 15. Noxzema — Joe and Farrah 
After teasing the ad online, including on a certain Marvel star's Instagram page, the first of two Super Bowl ads surfaced on YouTube this week. Zuckerberg's tech firm has enlisted the help of  
Super Bowl Commercial Lineup. With all Super Bowl ad slots reportedly spoken for, including some 60-second commercials along with the more popular 30 and 15 second slots, here’s the latest  
Budweiser Super Bowl commercial goes national in AB InBev switch - Ad Age January 28, 2025 Super Bowl LIX: Chiefs vs. Eagles by the Numbers - Sportico.com January 28, 2025 Hellmann's Super Bowl ad creating quite the buzz ahead of big game January 28, 2025 
Wealthsimple has long considered Canadian Super Bowl ads “undervalued” and “one of the best deals around.” While the cost of an ad for the U.S. telecast is exponentially more expensive  
SuperBowl-Ads.com, a website dedicated to archiving and providing timely coverage of Super Bowl commercials, has earned the respect of many fans for its comprehensive and insightful reviews. Since its launch in 1998, SuperBowl-Ads.com has become the go-to source for information about Super Bowl advertisements. 
Doritos released a Super Bowl ad-before-the-ad featuring Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes, Chris Jones, Creed Humphrey and Xavier Worthy purportedly choosing the brand's Super Bowl 59 commercial. 
Google's upcoming Super Bowl ad is an emotional piece that comes 15 years after the company's first-ever ad spot. Ahead of the Super Bowl this Sunday, Feb. 9,

This means that every Super Bowl since has only had Canadian ads, despite the fact that many Canadians said the ads are a major reason for watching. Alas, that rule hasn’t changed in 2023.
