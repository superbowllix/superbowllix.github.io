A. Kyle Shanahan has never won the Super Bowl as the head coach. Although he led the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV, where they lost against the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 20-31. 
Super Bowl LIV saw Shanahan's 49ers enter the fourth quarter with a 20-10 lead only to give up 21 unanswered points to cough up the chance to add a sixth Lombardi Trophy to San Francisco's ledger. 
Kyle Shanahan is an American football coach who is considered one of the most creative minds in the NFL. Since 2017 Shanahan has been the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, and he has led the team to two Super Bowl appearances (2020 and 2024). 
Shanahan’s well-documented Super Bowl struggles include his team blowing double-digit leads in all three of the Super Bowls he has coached in. With an impressive 49ers roster heading into this season, Shanahan’s team may return to the Super Bowl again in seven months, but his history may cast a dark cloud over any future Super Bowl appearance. 
As the San Francisco 49ers prepare for their Super Bowl LVIII matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs this Sunday, head coach Kyle Shanahan has a proverbial monkey to get off his back. Shanahan is 0-1  
Kyle Shanahan's Super Bowl History. In full-circle fashion, Shanahan's initial victorious big-game trip came when he was in high school. At the age of 15, his father Mike Shanahan was the OC of San Francisco's 1994-95 championship team. Ironically, current 49ers tailback Christian McCaffrey's dad -- Ed McCaffrey-- was also on that Super Bowl  
The only thing separating Shanahan from becoming a truly great coach is a Super Bowl. Four years ago he led the 49ers there, only to be beaten by the Kansas City Chiefs 31-20 at Hard Rock Stadium  
Kyle Shanahan Coaching History.  Since then, the 49ers have become a perennial Super Bowl contender under Kyle Shanahan. In his 7 seasons with the team (by the end of the 2023 season), a

The theme of Shanahan's Super Bowl history has been late collapses. While he wasn't the head coach of the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, Shanahan was the offensive coordinator for the team that  
In 2016, he made it to Super Bowl 51 as the Falcons' offensive coordinator. That year, Atlanta famously blew a 28-3 lead to Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and the Patriots, overshadowing the Shanahan  
He was the offensive coordinator in Atlanta when the Falcons squandered a 28-3 lead in Super Bowl 51 against New England, leading to a 34-28 overtime loss.. He then had a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl against Kansas City four years ago only to have quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and the offense sputter and the defense wilt in a 31-20 loss to the Chiefs. 
Kyle Shanahan has coached 8 seasons in the NFL for the San Francisco 49ers. Between the years of 2017 and 2024, he compiled a record of 78-66 in regular season and postseason games. He won 2 conference championships and 3 division championships.
