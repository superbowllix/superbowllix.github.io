        <h2><strong>tecmo super bowl nes best team best super bowl performances of all time</strong></h2>
        <p>Among the Tecmo Super Bowl community, it is common for distinguished groups/tournament organizers (such as the Tomczak Bowl) to create tier lists, rankings of a teams's potential in tournaments. Tomczak Bowl uses a tier system of play. Teams are grouped into tiers of five based on their overall strength of play. Tier 1 is reserved for the best teams while Tier 5 is for the not so great. All 28  
3. Houston Oilers: That the Oilers are the actual best team in the AFC is somewhere between ‘open secret’ and ‘not any sort of secret, whatsoever’ among TSB veterans. This is entirely because of their nuclear-hot passing game. Warren Moon is arguably the best QB in the whole game, possessing an arm that’s both powerful and accurate. 
Top Kick Returners &gt; Craig Heyward RB1 #34; Merril Hoge RB1 #33; Warren Williams RB2 #42; Tim Worley RB3 #38; Richard Bell RB4 #21 
PHI - QB eagles is perhaps the best player in the game, but his supporting cast on both O and D is quite flawed. Brown and Joyner are decent, but it's just not enough to stop good offenses. The PHI offense relies on almost entirely on pass plays and scrambling, which allows opponents to call pass plays all game and play bend-but-don’t-break  
Then there's a clump of teams probably best described as mediocre (Cardinals, Rams, Jets, Browns, Cowboys)and Tampa may avoid that clump, but not the next one (Steelers, Broncos, Falcons, Saints, Vikings, Buccaneers). 
The game Tecmo Super Bowl was released for NES in December of 1991, and is the greatest sports game ever released on that system (not only imho, but I think by popular consensus). For my money, it has a case as the greatest sports game period , as well as for the greatest all-around game ever released for NES [to me, at least].

Denver because it’s vintage John Elway and they are my favorite team. The best team is probably the Giants because Otis Anderson is the closest to Bo Jackson in the original Tecmo Bowl. Tacklers fly off him. I hate that Jim Kelly is QB Bills but Buffalo is a monster team as well. 
In celebration of us all being fools, we humble users of r/nfl have been gifted with a Tecmo Super Bowl theme! The NES game remains one of the most enjoyable Football video games ever made. The NES game remains one of the most enjoyable Football video games ever made. 
27. Indianapolis Colts: I had no kind words for the Seahawks whatsoever, but believe it or don’t, there’s still one final, soul-crushing drop-off in overall team quality. This is it. We’ve reached the absolute nadir of Tecmo Super Bowl teams. The Colts and Patriots are widely acknowledged as the two worst teams in the game. 
I've found a lot of discussion on the best teams in the NES version but since the rosters are different on the SNES and Sega versions of Tecmo Super Bowl which teams are the best and which are the worsts? 
I have an 8 person tourney schedule in August. I am looking for some input from anyone who would like to add their 2 cents. I have the following teams to be drawn at random from a hat before the tourney starts. I hoped to pick out 8 of the most well matched teams from the best teams in the game.  
For Tecmo Super Bowl on the NES, a GameFAQs message board topic titled "Worst team.". 
Have to start off by saying it is great to find a forum that focuses on this game. My friends and I would play this game constantly during the early 90's. Anyways as I recall almost every season I played it usually ended up being the 49ers, or Giants, (on rare occasions the Bears) coming out of t 
umm.. what brudd said. lol. i used to use DL a lot before i found this board, so I would like to add that Jacob Green is a good DL on the Seahawks, the Raiders have the best DL in the game with Long and Townsend and another 69hp guy at NT, William Perry, Gerald Williams and Jerry Ball are the next best NTs after Bob Nelson, and Reggie White is about the same as Long. 
There is NO WAY that Philly is the best team in Tecmo. Just not possible. Against a team with a potent passing attack (Oilers, 49ers, Bills, Dolphins, Rams, etc.), you won't be able to get the stops you need to win. 
For Tecmo Super Bowl on the Super Nintendo, Roster FAQ by Toad22484.  wanted a quick reference guide to all the tecmo teams players and Ratings, so I decided to  
Tecmo Super Bowl Decades-1990s (TSBD90) is a culmination of the 1990-1999 Legacy Series (LS90). TSBD90 is a dual game pack featuring all the best teams from LS90. Both game files provide the following gameplay elements: - All mini/large helmets to include team logos have been touched up to remove muddy textures and unnecessary shading. 
Now if you want a team with a decent offense and arguably a top 5 defense in the game, then the Giants are the perfect choice. Sure you could mention the 49ers who are also in the same boat. The Giants have a better defense than the 49ers, while the 49ers have a better offense. 
I'm sure this has been asked before and I am sure there are many opinions out there but I was just wondering what everyones top playbooks are for some of the teams in Tecmo Super Bowl might be. I am a beginning noob but grew up with older brothers who played the game and I was just wanting to hear peoples strategies on setting playbooks for  </p>
