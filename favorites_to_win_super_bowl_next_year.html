        <p>Why: Another close win for the Chiefs to complete the three-peat as Chris Jones takes advantage of the Eagles' OL injuries to win Super Bowl MVP. Mike Band: Chiefs 24, Eagles 20 
Super Bowl favorites. The Chiefs (-124) and Eagles (+107) are only two teams remaining on the Super Bowl odds board. This year is a rematch from Super Bowl 57, which KC won 38-35. Kansas City Chiefs (Kansas City Chiefs -120 on DraftKings) 
The Kansas City Chiefs captured Super Bowl 58 and the team is listed as a +650 betting choice (Bet $100 to win $650) to three-peat in 2025. Here were the opening odds for which NFL team will win Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans later in 2025. 
Let's reset the betting odds to win the 2025 Super Bowl, with Wild-Card Weekend up next. The Lions and Chiefs are favored to meet in New Orleans. 
If the Chiefs win Super Bowl 59, they would become the first NFL franchise to win three straight Super Bowls. Rounding out the Top 5 favorites are the Baltimore Ravens at +1000, Buffalo Bills  
The Kansas City Chiefs will meet the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59 on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans. Let's break down the 2025 Super Bowl odds with the big game just under a fortnight away. The Chiefs have the highest ticket % (12.6%) and handle % (16.8%) to win the Super Bowl per BetMGM. 
Chiefs and Lions still the favorites. It shouldn't come as a surprise, but the No. 1 seeds are still the favorites after getting last week off. One No. 1 seed made the Super Bowl last year, and  
The Chiefs opened with +500 odds to win the 2025 Super Bowl. That means a $100 bet at those odds would return $500 in profit if they win this weekend, or a $10 bet would return $50 in profit. 
Even in a crowded AFC North, the Ravens are still among favorites to win the Super Bowl next year after a season with the best record in the NFL and an AFC championship game appearance. 4. Buffalo  
Opening as favorites to win it all in New Orleans next year are the 49ers (+500), who led most of the game on Sunday but ultimately let Patrick Mahomes mount a second-half charge to win Kansas  
A lot will change over the next five months. But from where we stand now, at the start of the 2024-25 NFL season, FOX Sports' staff of football and gambling experts delivered their predictions on

Get latest team odds to win Super Bowl 59, predictions for favorites, plus best bets for sleeper teams to win Super Bowl LIX. Current Favorite: Kansas City Chiefs. 
Philadelphia’s biggest dip in Super Bowl odds during the postseason came after the divisional round. Prior to those games, the Eagles sat at +400 to win the Super Bowl, a 20% implied probability. A win over the Rams and the Commanders’ upset win over the Lions saw Nick Sirianni’s side drop from +400 to +180, a 35.7% implied probability  
Who's the favorite to be Super Bowl MVP? Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes is the favorite at +105 (if you bet $100 you would win $105). Here are the top 10 favorites: 
Welp, it's a rematch of Super Bowl LVII, which happened just two short years ago. Kansas City won that one 38-35, before going on to win last year's Super Bowl LVIII over the 49ers in overtime, 25-22. 
BetMGM released Super Bowl LIX odds for every team after the conclusion of Sunday’s game and the 49ers – not the Chiefs – are the favorites to win it all next year. They’re listed as +500  
However, that doesn’t necessarily mean they have the best odds to win next year’s big game. That honor goes to the team they just beat, the San Francisco 49ers – who just blew another double-digit lead against Patrick Mahomes and company on pro sports’ biggest stage. Here are the odds for all 32 teams to win next season’s championship. 
The 49ers' odds to win Super Bowl LVIIII is +600, meaning a bettor would have to wager $100 to get a total payout of $700. Meanwhile the back-to-back champion Chiefs are right behind them at +850. 
The Los Angeles Kings (27-17-6) are big home favorites (-245 moneyline odds to win) against the Montreal Canadiens (25-23-5, +200 moneyline odds). Wednesday's contest starts at 10:30 PM ET from Crypto.com Arena on ESPN+.Tune in to see the Kings and </p>
