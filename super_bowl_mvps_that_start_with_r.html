The award is currently decided by a fan vote during the game (20%) and by a panel of 16 American football writers and broadcasters who vote after the game (80%). Quarterbacks have won the award more than 50% of the time. See more Super Bowl MVP Trivia.

Patrick Mahomes doubled up his second regular-season MVP with his second Super Bowl MVP trophy in leading the Kansas City Chiefs to a thrilling, come-from-behind 38-35 victory in Super Bowl LVII

There have been a total of 57 Super Bowl MVPs handed out in the history of the NFL, yet only 48 players have actually received a Most Valuable Player trophy given out after the league championship game takes place. Here is the Complete list of NFL players to ever win Super Bowl MVP honor from SB I to LVII ( 1967-2024). 
Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL. At Super Bowl XXV, the league introduced the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, for the Super Bowl MVP. Ottis Anderson was the first to win this trophy. NFL Super Bowl MVP List 
A total of seven QBs have won both NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP. Patrick Mahomes was the last to accomplish the feat, having done so in 2023. Here is the full list of players who won both an NFL MVP  
Ben Roethlisberger won two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 and 2009, becoming one of the youngest quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl in his first victory. “Big Ben” was known  
He led the team to the Super Bowl five times, four as the starting quarterback. He led the Cowboys to victories in Super Bowl VI and Super Bowl XII. Staubach was named Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VI, becoming the first of four players to win both the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP, along with Jim Plunkett, Marcus Allen and Desmond Howard. 
The Super Bowl MVP is an award that is given out to the player who has had the most positive impact in that year's Super Bowl game. Barring an incredible exception, this award is generally always  
The first overall pick of the 1989 NFL Draft, Aikman played 12 consecutive seasons as the starting quarterback with the Cowboys, the most number of seasons by any Cowboy quarterback. During his career he was a six-time Pro Bowl selection, led the team to three Super Bowl victories, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXVII. 
The Super Bowl is just days away, so we took a look back at the best MVP performances in Super Bowl history: 10. Nick Foles, QB, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl LII vs. New England Patriots (2017) A backup quarterback outdoing Tom Brady in the Super Bowl? Well, that’s exactly what Foles did for the Eagles 
Lynn Swann became the first receiver to win the Super Bowl MVP after a Super Bowl-record 161-yard performance, nabbing a 64-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help put the trailing Steelers  
Fewer rushing yards and rushing TDs than Stephen Davis. If he doesn't win two Super Bowl rings, he doesn't make the hall of fame, that's a fact The pro football HOF has always had a hard on for Super Bowl rings. Namath doesn't get in without his ring. Terry Bradshaw gets in on the first ballot despite being average. 
One 2000 yard rushing season. 12 rushing TDs in 8 postseason games. Postseason record of 7-1, two Super Bowl wins. Last three seasons: 1194 yards, 4 TDs in 17 games. No postseason appearances. He did win an MVP and a Super Bowl MVP, but I don't think it would have kept him out of the hall if those awards had gone to Elway instead. 
I think something along the lines of 250+ yards, 65% completion, 1 INT or less and 3+ TDs should be enough since the awards is for the most VALUABLE player, not the best. A QB putting those numbers and winning means he was the most valuable since QB is the position that has more impact on the field. 
Super Bowl Most Valuable Players: NO. PLAYER: HIGHLIGHTS: I: Bart Starr, QB, Green Bay: Two touchdown passes: II: Bart Starr, QB, Green Bay: 202 yards passing, 1 TD </p>
