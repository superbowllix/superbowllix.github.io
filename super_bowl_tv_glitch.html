While there were few reports of issues on traditional cable and satellite services, many fans who watched the game on a live streaming service, or Paramount Plus, complained on social media of picture freezing and  
Streaming lag put Super Bowl viewers more than a minute behind what was happening in the game. Paramount Plus was the best and Fubo TV was the worst, one study found. The best Super Bowl stream

Paramount+ gave cord-cutters an easy way to tune into the Super Bowl on Sunday. But the livestream left some viewers longing for the good old days of cable as extended buffering and crashes

You should probably mention what you use to stream and whether you have 5.1 audio turned on or off. I have an Apple TV and have noticed lip sync issues previously and read that turning 5.1 audio off might fix my problems, but it didn't. I just turned on the coverage (and also just subscribed to YouTube TV 4K) and I think I'm seeing lip sync issues.

Two thieves rob a large fancy house when the owner is away. But when a visitor mistakes them for the owner, and they find out about a casting party mis-scheduled for that day, they decide to stick around for the fun. There's only one small problem, a little glitch in their plan. The real owners owe some bad dudes a lot of money, and they show up to collect.

A group of friends at a bar are on the edge of their seats as they watch a football game. At a crucial moment in the game, the TV glitches and the image goes dead.
