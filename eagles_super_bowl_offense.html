        <h2><strong>eagles super bowl offense super bowl performers past 10 years</strong></h2>
        <p>Below is a breakdown of how the Eagles and Chiefs offenses and defenses match up against one another ahead of their Super Bowl 59 clash. All stats are including the postseason. Eagles offense vs  
This Super Bowl is going to be fun: an Eagles defense that wants you to take your time and eat your vegetables against a Kansas City offense that’s got so much fiber in them they could stop up  
Feb 3, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA; A Nike Super Bowl LIX advertisement with images of Kansas City Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco (left) and Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley at  
278.4: They say defense wins championships, and Philadelphia's run to the Super Bowl has been aided by a strong defense. The Eagles finished the regular season as the No. 1 in terms of total  
Yet the team still enters the Super Bowl ranked eighth in adjusted pass offense, showing that this passing attack remains efficient when called upon. Between the talented wideout duo of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, as well as tight end Dallas Goedert, the Eagles shouldn't be a completely one-dimensional offense against the Chiefs. 
Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33  going up 22-12 ahead of halftime thanks to the now famous 'Philly Special,' and the offense kept its foot on the gas in the second half even as Brady  
How do these Eagles compare to the 2022 Super Bowl team?. The biggest difference between the 2022 Eagles and the 2024 Eagles comes on offense. Surprisingly, the 2022 Eagles were more efficient  
Historically, teams that rely heavily on one player to carry the offense haven’t shown a particularly strong trend in the Super Bowl, either positively or negatively. Teams entering the Super Bowl with a player accounting for at least 40% of their scrimmage yards in the playoffs have a 6-9 record in the big game. 
This isn't the Eagles line that terrified the league to the tune of 70 sacks during their last Super Bowl run. Edge-rusher Josh Sweat led the team with eight sacks, and free-agent addition Bryce  
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
Discussing how the decision to stop calling plays came about and why it remains a good decision to this day, with Kellen Moore calling the shots on offense now, with reporters at Super Bowl media  
The Eagles have punched their ticket to Super Bowl LIX in the most unlikely way—by passing the football. After they scuffled through most of the season offensively, everything finally came  
Here are some key matchups to watch in Super Bowl LIX when the Eagles' offense faces the Chiefs' defense. By Dave Zangaro • Published February 4, 2025 USA Today Images 
Ravens, Rams, Commanders, Bengals. This is a defense that can win a Super Bowl with or without the help of the offense. But if the offense plays like it did today the opposing team has no hope.

When the Eagles played Mahomes in Super Bowl LVII, they were in man coverage on 53.3% of his dropbacks and he completed 13 of 15 attempts for 93 yards and 3 touchdowns against it, per NextGen  
How do the Chiefs and Eagles matchup in Super Bowl LIX? Well, here is a break down of each key position on offense and defense: Quarterback The comparisons between these two is not close, not because of Jalen Hurts’ incompetencies but because of Mahomes’ greatness. Mahomes has been there and done it too many times 
Fake the run to the left and throw it to the right to a receiver coming across the formation who ran a 4.21 40. Football is simple. The Bills don’t play man coverage here, but they still can’t

This isn't that Eagles team, or that Chiefs team, which begs the question: can the Eagles avenge their Super Bowl LVII loss, or will their flawed offense finally catch up to them? Let's break it down. 
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) scores a touchdown on a quarterback sneak against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first quarter in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on Feb. 12, 2023. </p>
