There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
Yet while Detroit does not have a Super Bowl to its name, the franchise has won an NFL championship. In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957.

While the city of Detroit has hosted only one Super Bowl, a second game was hosted in nearby Pontiac, Mich., former home of the Pontiac Silverdome. The since-demolished stadium hosted Super Bowl XVI in January 1982, marking the first time the game was held in a cold-weather city. The San Francisco 49ers defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 26-21. 
Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships, with the last coming in 1957.

The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX.

Detroit Lions to the Super Bowl? Sports Illustrated thinks so. After a heartbreaking end to the season last year, the Detroit Lions have their eyes set on a much larger prize this 2024-25 season. 
The Detroit Lions' playoff run came to a heartbreaking end in the Divisional Round against the Washington Commanders.
