        <p>The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
While viewership for prime time series and other annual events such as the Academy Awards has declined over time, viewership of the Super Bowl has remained stable.

The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl

It doesn't grow year-over-year on its own. But there is a chance that this year's viewership will be even greater than last year as Nielsen nails down how to account for out-of-home viewing  
Super Bowl viewership has fluctuated over the years but increased by about 26% from 2021 to 2024, while the U.S. resident population increased steadily year over year. Interestingly the trends in annual percentage change in Super Bowl viewership and annual U.S. population change are similar, though there may not be a direct correlation. 
The NFL said that last year's Super Bowl drew in 62.5 million global viewers, which was a 10 percent increase from the year prior. Mexico and Canada combined for over 42 million viewers, but  
How many people watched the Super Bowl? 2024's Super Bowl had a viewership of over 123 million, making it the most watched TV telecast of all time.  and will renew after one year to the regular  
The Super Bowl proved to be a record-breaking culmination of an already historically impressive year for NFL games—matchups during the 2023 regular season drew an average of 17.9 million viewers  
In total, year-over-year viewership was up 7.4% from 2023. “We are excited to work with the NFL, CBS, Paramount+, Nickelodeon and Univision to capture the full breadth of audience engagement for this record breaking Super Bowl,” said Nielsen CEO Karthik Rao. 
The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). Men 18-24 placed second with a 20% increase (from 3.86 to 4.61 million) and girls 12-17 third with an 11% jump (from 2.63 to 2.85 million).

Over the years, I have seen Super Bowl streaming numbers misreported with numbers that have no source to them and don’t match the numbers put out each year by the broadcast networks.

Despite the trend of lower viewership, there is one instance that raises audience interest, but it remains outside of the NFL’s direct control: too  
The Kansas City Chiefs' last-second 38-35 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, one of the highest-scoring games in Super Bowl history, delivered massive viewership numbers, as well. 
There were 114.2 million people tuning in for the Super Bowl when the Chiefs beat the Eagles last year, according to Sports Media Watch, which set a viewership record. Across all platforms, it's

Super Bowl XX became the first game to surpass 90 million viewers and it would take another 20 years for the NFL to break 100 million viewers, as 106.5 million tuned in to watch Drew Brees and
