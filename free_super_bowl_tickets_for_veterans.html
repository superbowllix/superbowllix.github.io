        <p>Tickets for Troops. Veteran Tickets Foundation's Tickets for Troops Program is dedicated to giving back to those who gave us so much. We team up with major sports teams, leagues, promoters, organizations, venues and every day event ticket holders to provide free tickets to currently serving and veterans of all branches of the US military.

The vision that began with one empty seat at the Super Bowl has now turned into nearly 10 million seats filled through tickets given to military members and their families in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Vet Tix provides tickets to all active-duty military members and veterans, including immediate family of troops who were killed in action. 
This success, which is especially dependent on the veterans who use those tickets, has allowed Vet Tix to get veterans and military members to the Super Bowl. In the future, Vet Tix hopes to get its membership to the biggest games in sports, including the NFL games, MLB World Series, the NBA and NCAA Basketball Finals, and the Stanley Cup.

Since 2008, we have had the pleasure to distribute more than 20.3 million free tickets to over 1,848,971 VetTixers. Tickets for these events are donated both by venues/promoters, and people who love the organization and service members. Sometimes events are free, or sometimes they are available for ridiculously cheap, like the Super Bowl. 
To enrich our Veterans' quality of life and to honor and recognize their service, Veteran Tickets Foundation provides free event tickets to currently-serving military, Veterans and their families, as well as immediate family of those killed in action.
