        <h2><strong>super bowl winners seeds kendrick lamar super bowl video</strong></h2>
        <p>The #2 seed has also done well in the Super Bowl, with the AFC's #2 seed winning six Super Bowls since 1975, and the NFC's #2 seed winning four Super Bowls. Funnily enough, the #4 seed has managed to win the Super Bowl seven times since 1975, with AFC teams accounting for four of these wins. #3, #5 and #6 seeds have all won the Super Bowl twice  
They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, giving them four Super Bowl appearances in five years and putting them one win away from three consecutive Super Bowl titles. In the intervening year, they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver  
The Rams lost Super Bowl XIV 31-19 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1979 as the No. 3 seed. On the other side of the ball we have a No. 1 seed. Since 1990, including the Niners, 33 top-seeded teams  
1997 Denver Broncos, No. 4 seed: 31-24 over Packers in Super Bowl 32 2000 Baltimore Ravens, No. 4 seed: 34-7 over Giants in Super Bowl 35 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers, No. 6 seed: 21-10 over Seahawks  
The last time the Eagles were the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, after the 2017 season, they advanced to Super Bowl 52. There they beat the AFC No. 1-seeded Patriots 41-33. 
Pittsburgh won 21-10 and head coach Bill Cowher and running back Jerome Bettis were able to retire as Super Bowl champions. The 2005 Steelers were the first team to win a Super Bowl as a No. 6 seed. 
The Packers would reel off four straight wins to win the Super Bowl, defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 21-16, the Atlanta Falcons 48-21, the Chicago Bears 21-14 and the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25. There is no doubt that the top seeds have a massive advantage, and there is a reason why only two #6 seeds have won the Super Bowl over the past three  
Between January 19, 2015 and January 19, 2025, the Kansas City Chiefs and the New England Patriots are tied for the most wins in Super Bowls, with 3 wins. 
Montana was named Super Bowl MVP, setting five Super Bowl records in the win while also becoming the third player to win the Super MVP and AP MVP in the same season. Super Bowl 26: Redskins vs Bills The NFL expanded the playoffs to 12 teams in 1990, and Washington and the Bills were the first teams to both make the Super Bowl as the No. 1 seed  
• Since 2000, only two No. 1 seeds have won the Super Bowl -- the 2009 Saints and the 2003 Patriots. In that same span, four No. 2 seeds, one No. 3 seed, two No. 4 seeds, one No. 5 seed and two No. 6 seeds have won the Super Bowl. • In the first 12 years of the “home-field era” (post-1974), 10 No. 1 seeds won the Super Bowl.

That peculiar seed matchup marked the first Super Bowl in the modern seeding era where neither a No. 1 nor a No. 2 seed was in the game. Of course, it was a short-lived trend in that the 2023 matchup pitted No. 1 seeds against one another. 
About three-quarters (32 of 42) of teams that made the Super Bowl got a bye (first or second seed) from 1999 to 2019 made the Super Bowl. This included 52% of teams that were the one seed and 24%  
No. 3 seed: Third-best record among division winners; No. 4 seed: Fourth-best record among division winners; No. 5 seed: Best record among wild-card teams;  Super Bowl LIX: Feb. 9; 
Well, last year, neither #1 seed made it to the Super Bowl-- it was the Bengals, seeded #4, who beat the #1 and #2 AFC seeds. The Rams were also the #4 seed in the NFC who defeated the #2 seed to play the SB in their home stadium. Your chances of winning improve drastically once you get to the big game. 
The two-time defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs (15-2) and Detroit Lions (15-2)  No. 2 seed Buffalo (-8.5) and No. 3 Baltimore (-9.5) both are favored by more than a touchdown in  
Now they would become the only franchise in the modern playoff era to win a Super Bowl as the No. 6 seed and lose a Super Bowl to a 6-seed. The Packers built leads of 14-0 in the second quarter and 21-10 in the third, then held on to beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round 21-16, sealing the victory by intercepting Michael Vick in
