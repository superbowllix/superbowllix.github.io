        <p>Rings from the first 57 Super Bowls Joe Theismann's NFL rings (2006); his 1983 NFC Championship ring (left), and his 1982 Super Bowl XVII Championship ring (right). The Super Bowl ring is an award in the National Football League given to the team members of the winning team of the league's annual championship game, the Super Bowl. 
Third place is also held by two teams, the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants, both with four Super Bowl wins. No team has ever won three Super Bowls in a row, but several teams have won  
The New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most wins in Super Bowls, with 6 wins. 
While the five listed above first won in 1981, Sapolu wasn't with the team until 1983, so Super Bowl 14 was his first championship.  The first Super Bowl ring for Mahomes, Travis Kelce and  
The player with the second most Super Bowl rings is Charles Haley, a linebacker who won five Super Bowls in his career.  Practice squad players are also awarded a ring, though team owners are

However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. 
Pannunzio, who guided the Racers to their last conference championship in 2002, serves as the assistant special teams coordinator for the Eagles, who will face two-time defending champion Kansas City in Sunday in Super Bowl 59 at New Orleans. Pannunzio was also in this position when the Eagles faced the Chiefs in the 2023 Super Bowl in Glendale  
The first Super Bowl rings were awarded in 1966 to the Green Bay Packers. They featured a 0.5-carat diamond surrounded by white gold. The rings were designed by Packers head coach Vince Lombardi  
The Super Bowl ring is the most coveted ring in the world. It sets the standard of excellence. It is the greatest sports award in the world and the most coveted piece of jewelry for men. Journey with me as we list the historic winners from 1966 through present, review the trophy awarded and enjoy the pride of success with quotes from the legendary Vince Lombardi and a tribute poem

These rings feature the team name, logo, the title “World Champions,” and the Super Bowl’s designation in Roman numerals. The financial investment in these rings is significant, with the NFL contributing between $5,000 and $7,000 per ring for up to 150 rings per team. 
Tom Brady padded his record in Super Bowl 56. Here's a look at current and former NFL players with the most championship rings all time. Hint: Ex-49ers and Steelers frequent the list. </p>
