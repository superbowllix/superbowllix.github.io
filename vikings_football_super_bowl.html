        <p>The Vikings have an all-time overall record of 537–438–11, [a] the highest regular season and combined winning percentage among NFL franchises who have not won a Super Bowl, in addition the most playoff runs, division titles, and (tied with the Buffalo Bills) Super Bowl appearances.

In 1976, led by Rookie of the Year Sammy White and All-Pro Chuck Foreman, they made it to Super Bowl 11, their third Super Bowl appearance in four seasons, but lost in humiliating fashion to the Raiders 32-14. The closest Minnesota has come since was in 1998. With a 15-1 record, the Vikings were a heavy favorite to finally make a Super Bowl
