        <p>The 30-second ad spots during Super Bowl LVIII — when the Kansas City Chiefs clinched the Lombardi trophy after the game went into overtime against the San Francisco 49ers — cost brands a  
Here’s a breakdown of the costs for Temu’s Super Bowl ads: Year. Cost. Ad length. Celebrity/Content. 2020: $10 million: 60-second ad: Taylor Swift, "Lover" theme song: 2021: $12 million: 30  
Growing ecommerce app Temu spent big on Super Bowl commercials this year. The Chinese app bought air time for three commercials during the game and two after. Super Bowl advertising is some of the most expensive of the year. For Super Bowl LVIII, advertisers paid between $6.5 million and $7 million for a 30-second commercial, CNN reported  
Ad slots for the Super Bowl cost between $6.5 million to $7 million a pop, per CNN.Going by those numbers, Temu spent approximately $15 million on its in-game commercials. 
With a reliable audience of over 100 million viewers, the Super Bowl is among the most prominent advertising opportunities on television. This year, companies are paying a whopping $7 million for just 30 seconds of airtime. Despite the record ad costs, Temu ran several commercials during the Super Bowl. 
Temu aired three commercials throughout Super Bowl 2024, and consumers are wondering how much the ad spots cost.  Consumers have apparently made Temu rich enough to afford 3 Super Bowl  
Temu's Super Bowl ads sparked a surge in online searches despite recent downturn among users.  A 30-second spot in Sunday's game cost companies a whopping $7 million. 
Temu’s Super Bowl spend may have run into the tens of millions of dollars — a 30-second commercial during Sunday night’s game cost about $7 million. Web searches for the app spiked when its ads aired, according to Google Trends data, but searches have been steadily declining since early July. 
The ad prices for the Super Bowl set a historic record, hitting a price tag of $7 million for every 30 seconds. This clearly indicated the incalculable commercial value of the 2023 Super Bowl. What’s more, the audience for the Super Bowl highly overlapped with Temu’s target audience. Temu sells everyday products on its platform, and the  
A majority of Super Bowl watchers online have reacted poorly to the Super Bowl ad, raising confusion as to how the new app could afford the event’s pricey $7 million per-30-second commercial

Temu’s spending on the Super Bowl this year is just a drop in the bucket for the company, Kaziukėnas noted, citing the company’s massive $3 billion U.S. ad budget last year. 
Temu’s Super Bowl ads cost roughly $7 million each — which was the going rate for 30-second ads during this year’s big game — and come as part of a $3 billion marketing push this year as  
Next month, more than 100 million people are expected to watch the Super Bowl — and with it, a Temu ad that likely cost up to $7 million, by some estimates. Andrew Lipsman, an independent e-commerce analyst, told Modern Retail that he’s “never seen a strategy quite like this.” 
The significant cost of Super Bowl ads has seen a remarkable escalation over the years. In the inaugural Super Bowl between the Green Bay Packers and the Chiefs in 1967, brands paid a mere $42,000 for ad time, a stark contrast to the current astronomical figure of $7 million for a 30-second slot. This staggering increase highlights the  
Some critics accused Temu of spending money on Super Bowl ads, which are said to cost millions of dollars, while offering products at extremely low prices. Doing so suggests there are labor

Was advertising during the Super Bowl the right move for Temu? Companies tend to place their best ads during the Super Bowl because of the high price tag and visibility. Super Bowl advertising is also a risky investment for most companies. Therefore, it's unusual for Temu, a recent entrant in a new market, to buy ad time during the Super Bowl.

From the outset, Temu has seemed to grasp that one of its greatest challenges in its endeavor to dominate American shopping is  
Temu, the e-commerce app run by Chinese company PDD Holdings, plans to run a Super Bowl ad on Sunday, a spokesperson told CNBC, as it looks to continue growing rapidly in the United States. </p>
