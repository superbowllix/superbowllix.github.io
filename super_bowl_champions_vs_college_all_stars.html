        <p>In the 42 College All-Star Games, the defending pro champions won 31, the All-Stars won nine, and two were ties, giving the collegians a .238 winning percentage. The second game, played in 1935, involved the hometown Chicago Bears , runner-up of the 1934 season , instead of the defending champion New York Giants . 
The last game, a 24‑0 win by the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers in 1976, was played in a 'surreal' deluge.  Ward came up with a similar idea for football, pitting college all-stars  
In 1976, 22-year-old Jackie Slater out of Jackson State played in a game that was known as the College All-Star Football Classic, where he and other college all-stars faced off against Joe Greene  
While we can’t conceive college players facing the seasoned players of the league at this age, there was a time when the college All-Stars team gave head-to-head competition to the pro players. In 1963, the Green Bay Packers witnessed the phenomenon firsthand, and the then-head coach wasn’t impressed. 
Amazingly, in those days, they could. In the 1930s and 1940s, the best college players didn’t always choose to play pro football, and pro players weren’t necessarily better than college players. The first five College All-Star Games featured two wins by the college players, two ties, and only one win by the NFL team. 
The idea was simple - a panel of sports writers would select a college football all-star team, and this team would go up against the Super Bowl champion in a preseason exhibition game. The two sides agreed to the idea and the first game was set for August 31st, 1934. 
The Chicago Charities College All-Star Game was a preseason football tilt played annually (except 1974) from 1934 to 1976 between the National Football League champions and a team of star college seniors from the previous year. (There was one exception: The 1935 game involved the 1934 runner-up Chicago Bears instead of the champion New York  
In 1976 the Pittsburgh Steelers, Super Bowl X Champions, were beating the College All-Stars 24-0 with 1:22 left in the third quarter when the game was delayed after a torrential rainstorm hit  
Known as the Chicago Charities College All-Star Game, the contest was played every year but one between 1934 and 1976, with 1974 being the lone exception, cancelled due to that year’s NFL  
The Chicago Charities College All-Star Game was a preseason American football game played annually (except in 1974) from 1934 to 1976 between the National Football League champions and a team of star college seniors from the previous year. It was also known as the College All-Star Football Classic.[1] After the Super Bowl began, including the two seasons prior to the NFL/AFL merger, the Super  
One aspect of the College All-Star Game was later revived. The concept of the Super Bowl champion playing in the first game of the season was adopted in 2004 for the National Football League Kickoff game; in that game, the first game of the regular season is hosted by the league champion from the previous year. 
The first college all-star team to win was the 1937 squad. The college all-stars were led by future Hall of Famer Sammy Baugh, who threw the only touchdown pass of the game in a 6-0 victory over Curly Lambeau’s Green Bay Packers. The final game was played in 1976 against the Super Bowl X champion Pittsburgh Steelers. 
The 39 th College All-Star Game on July 28, 1972 featured the Dallas Cowboys, NFL Champions of the previous season, against an All-Star squad coached by Nebraska’s Bob Devaney. The Cowboys, under Head Coach Tom Landry, were a formidable team on both sides of the ball. 
But back in the day, the NFL Champion/Super Bowl Champion would take on a College All-Star team in an exhibition game prior to the start of the next season. The game was called the Chicago College All-Star Game and it took place from 1934-1976 (with the exception of 1974, due to the NFL strike). 
Beginning in 1934, the Chicago College All-Star game served as the preseason kickoff to each NFL season. Conceived by Arch Ward of The Chicago Tribune (who also developed major league baseball’s annual All-Star Game), it matched the previous season’s NFL champion against a squad composed of top college players, many of whom were about to enter the pro ranks (in 1935, the runner-up Chicago  
The 40 th annual College All-Star Game on July 27, 1973 featured the Miami Dolphins, undefeated NFL Champions of the 1972 season, against a group of All-Stars coached by John McKay of USC. The Dolphins, under Head Coach Don Shula, featured a ball control offense led by power-running FB Larry Csonka (pictured at right), and QB Bob Griese was

In the pre-Super Bowl era, the College All-Star Football Classic was one of the most anticipated sporting events in the country. At the peak of its popularity in 1947, the Classic attracted a record 105,000 fan to Soldier Field to watch the All-Stars shut out the hometown Bears, 16-0. During the fifties, however, aver-
