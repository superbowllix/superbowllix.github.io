        <h2><strong>super bowl overtime ending super bowl rings per player</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl LI (2017) was the first to go to overtime, while the second was Super Bowl LVIII (2024). The NFL uses different overtime rules during the regular season and the playoffs. 
Super Bowl 58 went to overtime between the Chiefs and 49ers, and after San Francisco kicked a field goal with 7:22 left in the first overtime, the Chiefs drove down to the 49ers' three-yard line  
Only two Super Bowl have ever gone to overtime. You might remember both. Somehow, the Patriots forced an extra period despite trailing the Falcons 28-3. And of course Tom Brady and New England won  
The Patriots won the first overtime Super Bowl after making a 28-3 second-half comeback against the Falcons. New England's win came amid the old overtime rules, when the game automatically ended  
Four Super Bowls have nearly gone to overtime, but were decided by field goals in the final 10 seconds of the game. They include: Super Bowl V: Jim O’Brien kicked a field goal with five seconds  
If overtime happens, it wouldn't be a first for a Super Bowl. It would be a second. Of the first 56 Super Bowls , only one went into overtime, the New England Patriots' 34-28 comeback victory over  
The first Super Bowl that went to overtime also ended in walk-off fashion, but that game was more famous for its historic comeback than it's extra session. How many Super Bowls have gone to overtime? Prior to Sunday, only one Super Bowl had gone to overtime: the New England Patriots' 34-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. 
Starting with last season, all playoff games that advance to overtime will follow these revised rules, and that will include a potential overtime in Super Bowl LVIII:. If a game is tied at the end  
From 1974 until 2010, tied scores at the end of regulation were decided with a 15-minute “sudden-death” overtime period. In 2010, the rules were changed by the NFL, with the result being a  
For the second time in NFL history, the Super Bowl went into overtime. The San Franciso 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs ended their regulation time tying 19-19 as Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker forced  
For hours at Super Bowl LVIII, the action on the field was dull and Taylor Swift kept getting booed. But a terrific ending mostly made up for hours of mediocrity, Will Leitch writes. 
On the final call to end the Super Bowl LVIII overtime classic between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, Romo and play-by-play partner Jim Nantz’s lack of teamwork showed up at the  
The 49ers coach was on the field for the first Super Bowl overtime when his Falcons lost to the Patriots 34-28 in Super Bowl LI. The Falcons famously blew a 28-3 lead in a game where Shanahan was  
Playoff games cannot end in a tie, and neither can the Super Bowl. After the opening possession, any score can still end the game, but if it goes scoreless through an entire overtime period, they  
In the Super Bowl, the NFC and AFC championships, and all other playoff games, overtime periods last 15 minutes and will continue until a team has won; the game cannot end in a tie. If there is no score after the first overtime period, there will be a two-minute break before a new overtime period begins. 
But that can't happen in the postseason — and definitely not at the Super Bowl. A tie score at the end of the first overtime period launches a second 15-minute overtime, then a third and so on  
SUPER BOWL LVIII. What time did the Super Bowl end? The NFL championship game was one of just two Super Bowls to go to overtime and the Chiefs secured a famous victory at the death. 
Watch all of the highlights from the thrilling overtime game between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs at Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada.
