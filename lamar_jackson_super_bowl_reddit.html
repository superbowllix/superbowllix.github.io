        <p>Marino went to a super bowl, has eight playoff wins, and set several records in the process, most of which survived until the rule changes (or Kurt Warner). Lamar needs at least postseason success or to hold a bunch of important milestones (probably in rushing or scrimmage yards) to overcome a lack of a Super Bowl appearance. 
Welcome to the Reddit home of the 6-time Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots of the National Football League. Members Online ADMIN MOD • Lamar Jackson in the playoffs 
Jackson, who lost to Mahomes and the Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game, is the ninth player to win multiple NFL MVP awards in the Super Bowl era but is the only one to not win a Super Bowl. The other players who've won more than one NFL MVP since 1967 are: Peyton Manning (five), Aaron Rodgers (four), Tom Brady (three), Brett Favre (three  
Lamar Jackson has once again fallen short in his quest to win a Super Bowl, but the star quarterback hasn't lost the confidence of his Baltimore Ravens teammates. Following the 27-25 loss to the  
The Ravens won Super Bowls in 2000 and 2012—exactly 12 years apart. Both times, their quarterbacks were 28 years old: Trent Dilfer in 2000 and Joe Flacco in 2012. Now it’s the 2024 season, 12 years later, and Lamar Jackson just turned 28. 
Listen to Jason Smith of Fox Sports Radio’s The Jason Smith Show explain why the Super Bowl window for Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens is already closed, as Smith says Lamar blew a once-in-a-lifetime chance at winning his first Super Bowl with the Ravens having home-field advantage in an AFC Championship Game over a vulnerable underdog  
Jackson, a four-time Pro Bowler and three-time All-Pro, is already the only multi-time MVP winner to not have a Super Bowl title. GO DEEPER Appreciate Lamar Jackson's brilliance, even if football  
A trip to the AFC championship game — and possibly the Super Bowl — slipped through the Baltimore Ravens' collective fingers. Star quarterback Lamar Jackson lamented a litany of self-inflicted  
A head-turning trend in Super Bowl winners has fans convinced that the champion for Super Bowl LIX has already been decided.  On Tuesday, Lamar Jackson turned 28 years old. Check that box as well. 
The prospect of Lamar winning another MVP award makes me feel the same way I felt about the Ravens’ unbeaten pre-season streak. Not much. Without a Super Bowl ring to go with it, it’s even a little embarrassing. I hate to throw the haters a bone, but let’s be honest: the only trophy that matters in the NFL is the Lombardi. 
Their WRs are Uber athletic and talented. Theres a cut up of Lamar missing big on like 5 wide open deep throws to Hollywood this year. Lamar has only shown the capability to consistently hit people over the middle at a pro level. Outside of that he's super inconsistent and is not required to read defenses. 
i will say it’s funny how lamar’s pick 6 basically saved josh allen’s post season. he balled out against a bad colts team and then dropped two horrendous performances in a row, yet doesn’t get half the flak. people even tried to tear down lamar after clearly being the best player on the field against the titans 
Just being hyperbolic, but I find that it's a pretty common sentiment with people I know and twitter discourse that the common man will be rooting for the Detroit Lions to make the super bowl. I have also seen that many people think that this will be Lamar Jackson's year to secure his all time status and praying on Mahomes downfall. 
QB narrative is heavily driven by post season success. If he finishes his career as a 2x 1AP, 2x MVP, 9x probowler (pro Bowl is such an easy accomplishment for QBs i dont think 5x more is unrealistic) but never makes a Super Bowl he'll get in eventually but it would be unlikely to be first ballot.

Hello r/nfl!. With Super Bowl LIV on Sunday, we're bringing back our slate of daily discussion threads leading up to the game. We'll also maintain this hub thread, creating a one-stop shop for links pre-, current, and post-game discussion, including the regular weekly features like Wagers and Trash Talk, and the discussion series itself. 
Being able to bring the biggest game of the year into OT will always give it an automatic top-10 placement for me. This is also the longest Super Bowl game, as well as one of the longest playoff games in general. 
Lamar Jackson was supposed to “defeat” the chiefs because they would be done for the season and Taylor wouldn’t be on screen anymore. This did not happen. Lamar played a bad game and cheifs won, Taylor is going to the Super Bowl. 
According to Sportrac, after being named the NFL's second ever unanimous MVP, Lamar Jackson made $1,535,980 in 2020 and $1,771,588 in 2021. Typically, those numbers, matched with Lamar's talent, would have triggered the sort of "win now" roster moves that are often seen to maximize a team's Super Bowl window. 
Burrow's part of the conversation because he plays for Lamar's team's division rival and, while I think a lot of it was luck and having some very good wideouts, he *did* play in a Super Bowl fairly-recently. In theory, Lamar and Joe will see each other twice a year for at least the next five or six years, quite possibly longer than that. </p>
