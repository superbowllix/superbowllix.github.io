Super Bowl LIX will take place next month in the Superdome. The venue has hosted many NFL championships, as New Orleans has been a great backdrop. Which games have taken place in New Orleans and what other venue hosted the Super Bowl? Let‚Äôs take a look  
New Orleans hosted its first Super Bowl on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in front of a crowd of nearly 81,000. Led by Head Coach Hank Stram, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in the last-ever championship between the NFL and AFL before the two leagues merged. 
The city hosted the Super Bowl four times in the 1970s, twice in the 1980s and twice in the 1990s. New Orleans also hosted the Super Bowl in 2002, which culminated with a 20-17 upset victory by  
The first Super Bowl held in New Orleans was Super Bowl IV on January 11, 1970, in which the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 at Tulane Stadium, which held a crowd of 81,000 people. This was the last championship match between the NFL and AFL before the leagues completely merged.
