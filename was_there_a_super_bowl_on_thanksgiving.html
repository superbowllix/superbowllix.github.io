        <p>Thanksgiving Day football games in the United States are nearly as old as the game—and the organized holiday—themselves. The first Thanksgiving Day football game took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day of 1869, less than two weeks after Rutgers defeated Princeton in New Brunswick, New Jersey in what is widely recognized as the first intercollegiate football game in the  
The NFL Thanksgiving logo used for 2016; the year is updated annually, with the new NFL shield being used for the first time in 2008. Since its inception in 1920, the National Football League (NFL) has played games on Thanksgiving Day, patterned upon the historic playing of college football games on or around the November holiday. 
A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. [5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952  
FOX Sports made a significant announcement for Super Bowl 59 during Thanksgiving on Thursday. The network will call Super Bowl 59 inside the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Feb. 9. 
The last team to play on Thanksgiving and reach the Super Bowl were the Seattle Seahawks when they lost SB XLIX to the New England Patriots. They beat the San Francisco 49ers in 2014 on Thanksgiving Day. After that, we have to go all the way back to 1995 to find a Super Bowl contender competing on Thanksgiving. 
No. The Super Bowl is traditionally played in early February. What were the pointspreads for all past Super Bowls?

For a franchise that has never been to the Super Bowl, the Lions’ Thanksgiving game is their Super Bowl. This might be the first season in which expectations are slightly higher. 
The seven-time Super Bowl champion went 21-for-27 passing for 341 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions. The New England Patriots trailed 14-3 in the second quarter before turning the tide  
There have been plenty of other show-stopping performances on a football field, whether that be Super Bowl halftime shows such as Prince at Super Bowl 41, or exceptional national anthems like

Thanksgiving, for most Americans, is probably like 2-4 super bowl binge eating events packed into one day. Gotta go to moms Thanksgiving, gotta go to dads thanksgiving, gotta go to my mother-in-laws thanksgiving, then gotta go to my father-in-laws thanksgiving. 
There are few things better than Thanksgiving Week football – the cold, the score bugs, the turkey legs – and with three mammoth games to be wolfed down alongside plenty of turkey, stuffing and whatever Americans believe pass as ‘pies’ (sweet potato? Pumpkin? What an absurd, unserious culture) fans are in for a treat as the USA settles in for a holiday weekend.
