Performed live before 75,000 people, broadcast to 140 million more viewers at home, and racking up a production cost of $12 million dollars, Prince’s Super Bowl halftime performance was one of the biggest shows of his life. 
Prince’s Super Bowl setlist.  the artist addresses the 75,000 people in the stadium and roughly 140 million viewers with the first lines of the song: Dearly beloved,  
During this meeting, Prince and three members of his backing band New Power Generation performed for the executives, which convinced the executives that he would be the proper act to perform at the upcoming Super Bowl's halftime show. [1] [6] He was announced as the performer on December 10. [3] 
At the time of this performance, it set a Super Bowl halftime show record of 114 million viewers. Madonna was also the most searched term on Google during the game. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
The NFL said that last year's Super Bowl drew in 62.5 million global viewers, which was a 10 percent increase from the year prior. Mexico and Canada combined for over 42 million viewers, but  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until

This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
In one for the ages, legendary prankster John Hargrave orchestrated an ambitious “commercial” during Prince’s Super Bowl XLI halftime show.

The history of the Super Bowl Halftime Show. The Super Bowl halftime show wasn’t always about big-name stars and huge productions.

The most-watched Super Bowl Halftime Show is Michael Jackson’s iconic 1993 set at Super Bowl XXVII, drawing a reported 133.4 million American viewers. Before Jackson, the Halftime Show was largely uneventful and featured less appealing acts. 
#1 Celya723 3 February, 2019, 01:13. You nailed it with Prince putting on the most dynamic Super Bowl performance in the pouring rain!
