        <p>The Miami Dolphins were predicted to compete with the Buffalo Bills for the AFC East crown in 2024, but they started the 2024 season with a dismal 2–6 record. 
Miami has hosted 11 Super Bowls. The last one, Super Bowl 54 in 2020, generated over $500 million for the local economy. On February 9, 2025, New Orleans will tie Miami as the city to host the  
People around the NFL are waiting for the Miami Dolphins to show it on the field before they can be seriously considered a Super Bowl  to blame for Tua Tagovailoa going 20-of-39 for 199 yards  
This Dolphins team has been shy about discussing securing home field advantage in the playoffs, which is the goal, and talking about the Super Bowl, which is the final destination. 
Miami Dolphins fans don't need to be reminded that the Kansas City Chiefs are headed to the Super Bowl for a third consecutive season since they traded Tyreek Hill to South Florida, but the  
However, the Miami Dolphins are going on a terrible sequence when competing in cold temperatures. The team has lost 12 consecutive games when the temperature at kick-off was below 40 degrees (Fahrenheit). Tua Tagovailoa, the franchise quarterback, is praised when things go well but is often at fault when the Dolphins do poorly. 
Miami Dolphins offensive tackle Terron Armstead, speaking at the Super Bowl, says the team needs more of an edge to rebound from its 8-9 season.  We feel like we have the talent to go win. So  
In addition to being a credentialed member of the Miami Dolphins press corps, Alain has covered three Super Bowls (for NFL.com, Football News and the Montreal Gazette), the annual NFL draft, the  
This is the uphill battle the Miami Dolphins face. There are no Super Swift tailor-made roads to the Super Bowl. It usually takes years of coming close, getting yourself back up again, and then trying again until, hopefully, a team has a breakout season where they get enough breaks along the way to make it to the Super Game. 
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The Miami Dolphins had no choice. They had to pay Tua Tagovailoa. His four-year contract extension — worth $212.4 million, with $167 million guaranteed — is a franchise

In addition to being a credentialed member of the Miami Dolphins press corps, Alain has covered three Super Bowls (for NFL.com, Football News and the Montreal Gazette), the annual NFL draft, the  
Miami and New England are also the only two franchises to have posted undefeated regular-season records since the NFL-AFL merger, with Miami going 14–0 in 1972 and New England going 16–0 in 2007, but only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl. As of the 2024 season, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 64–55. 
Miami Dolphins fans have been waiting a long time to see their franchise play in a Super Bowl, and lots may never have. The Dolphins were founded in August 1965, and over their first four seasons in the NFL held the worst record of any franchise at the time. 
The only Super Bowl that's going to be better is the next one the Miami Dolphins are playing in." The Super Bowl is back in South Florida for the first time since 2010 thanks to the $700 million renovation of Hard Rock Stadium that was entirely funded by Ross. 
In this Dolphins Deep Dive video, the South Florida Sun Sentinel’s Chris Perkins and SI.com's Omar Kelly discuss what it would take for Miami to finally win the Super Bowl. 
The Miami Dolphins have 5 games played in Super Bowls all-time. 
But in 1971, Shula and the Dolphins began their legendary run of three straight Super Bowl appearances. The Dolphins went 10-3-1, winning the AFC East. The team then advanced to Super Bowl VI, where they fell to the Dallas Cowboys. Miami went 26-2 over the next two seasons, winning both Super Bowl VII and VIII. 
Worse, Dallas has a loss to Arizona (3-10) to go along with losses to San Francisco (9-3) and Philly (10-2).  So, my answer is yes, you can legitimately consider the Miami Dolphins a Super Bowl  </p>
