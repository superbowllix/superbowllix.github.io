        <p>The Jets have won one Super Bowl in their only Super Bowl appearance. They won Super Bowl III in 1969 against the Baltimore Colts, who were the strong favorites to win the game. 
The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL. The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) – winning the last two. 
Super Bowl champions by year. 1967 Super Bowl (1): Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 1968 Super Bowl (2): Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14 1969 Super Bowl (3): New York Jets 16  
The Jets have not played in the Super Bowl since the merger, losing the AFC Championship Game in the 1982, 1998, 2009 and 2010 seasons. [72] On the other hand, the Colts won Super Bowl V (1970), then after relocating to Indianapolis, won Super Bowl XLI (2006) and lost Super Bowl XLIV (2009). [73] [74] 
The New York Jets last won the Super Bowl in the 1968 season. The Jets beat the Baltimore Colts 16-7 in the Super Bowl. 
As heavy underdogs at Super Bowl III, the Jets represented the AFL with distinction as they defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts. The Jets became the first AFL team to defeat an NFL team in their combined championship game. When was the last New York Jets Super Bowl win? As noted, the Jets have been in just one Super Bowl, which they won in 1969. 
Broadway Joe Namath led the Jets to the first upset in Super Bowl history, the Dolphins won two of three Super Bowls in the early 1970s and then the Steel Curtain defense propelled the Steelers to  
More than a third of the teams in the NFL have never won a Super Bowl, and four franchises have never even appeared the title game.  Jets: 1. Overall Super Bowl record: 1-0. Buccaneers: 1

Conclusion. Super Bowl III marked the first time that the AFL would win the championship in the season’s biggest football game. With a big-league merger on the horizon after the upcoming season, Super Bowl IV would be the last chance for both the NFL and AFL to prove themselves the dominant league. 
The New York Jets last played a home playoff game on Jan 4, 2003, nearly 23 years ago, when they hosted the Colts in the Wild Card Round of the 2002 NFL playoffs, in which the Jets scored a 41-0 win. When was the last time the Jets lost a playoff game? 
The Patriots have appeared in the Super Bowl 11 times, the most of any NFL team. The San Francisco 49ers , Denver Broncos , Dallas Cowboys and Steelers are tied for the second-most with eight  
The Kansas City Chiefs are looking to become the first NFL team to win three consecutive Super Bowls. The vengeance-seeking Philadelphia Eagles are the only thing standing in the way of that goal. 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
Today is January 12th, 1969: The New York Jets Win Super Bowl III. Act One. It’s December 28th, 1958 at Yankee Stadium in New York, eight years before the Green Bay Packers will win Super Bowl I. Tension is rising as the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts battle it out to be named champions of the National Football League, or NFL. 
Brady did win back-to-back Super Bowl titles in 2003 and 2004 with the Patriots. However, the two-time NFL MVP needs another four Super Bowl titles to match Brady's final total of seven. 
Super Bowl III 50th Anniversary Celebration. The New York Jets, led by quarterback Joe Namath, rocked the sports world and the country on Jan. 12, 1969, by becoming the first American Football League team to defeat an NFL team with their 16-7 Super Bowl III victory over the heavily favored Baltimore Colts at Miami's Orange Bowl.
