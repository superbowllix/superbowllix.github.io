        <h2><strong>janet jackson super bowl show reddit super bowl champions quarterbacks</strong></h2>
        <p>On the Monday after the incident at Super Bowl Sunday, CBS had Jackson release a written statement apologizing, taking full blame for what they were now calling an unfortunate ‚Äúaccident‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. 
The Super Bowl was always weirdly conventional, but the commercials were all weirdly edgy. Two years earlier, there was that Coor‚Äôs Light Superbowl commercial that was a parody of Tom T Hall‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Love (Little Baby Ducks)‚Äù but the punchline is having threesome with twins (because lesbianism and incest are comparable, and both acceptable  
TIL after Janet Jackson's incident at the Super Bowl halftime show, Viacom retaliated by keeping her music off their properties including MTV, VH1, and radio stations. They also rescinded her invitation to the Grammys. Justin Timberlake was still allowed to go and actually picked up some awards. 
These pictures were obviously fabricated from screen shots of the 2003 Super Bowl halftime show ‚Äî given the crush of media attention resulting from one partially-exposed breast at the 2004 Super  
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple‚Äîadorned with a nipple  
But that‚Äôs exactly how FCC chairman Michael Powell described the 2004 halftime show. Specifically the portion of the show that featured Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and the wardrobe malfunction seen around the world. The show‚Äôs other acts (yes, there were other performers) Kid Rock, P. Diddy and Nelly, all escaped Powell‚Äôs ire. 
Despite feeling as though he had been thrown under the bus by the press a decade earlier, Michael Jackson did publicly address the Super Bowl halftime show scandal in the aftermath of the incident. Speaking to Fox News' Geraldo Rivera in 2005, Michael said he gave Janet Jackson some words of advice after the incident. 
The nation responded by making the Super Bowl the most-watched show once again, as if nothing unsavory had happened. Corporations paid more than $1 million for a 30-second commercial back then. 
Janet Jackson Doc ‚ÄòMalfunction‚Äô Explores Blacklisting Claims, Les Moonves Involvement in Super Bowl Controversy. Just over an hour long, the latest episode of 'The New York Times Presents  
Janet Jackson at the 2004 Super Bowl Photo: Frank Micelotta In a collection of interviews published in 2005, British novelist and cultural commentator J.G. Ballard put forth a pithy new theory  
But if you watched the Hulu documentary the producer revealed Justin did the pull off several counts early. So he messed up, the producers didn‚Äôt cut to black soon enough when they realized it went wrong and obviously scum bag Moonves orchestrated an misogynistic and racist fueled black out and attempt at erasing her from pop culture history. 
I‚Äôve always wondered where Janets career would have been had the Super Bowl incident not have happened. We all know how bias the media is against women and especially women of color, being most evident in JT taking 0% of the blame and having Janets legacy nearly erased over 1 mistake. 
‚ÄúOn February 1, 2004, the now-infamous ‚ÄúNipplegate‚Äù incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
I mean, up to that point, the super bowl halftime show was a PG affair. Parents can't be on defcon alert 24/7 and watching TV at home just might be one of those instances when you lower your guard. Reply reply 
Then my other co worker thought Janet was on the Masked Singer show, when it was Latoya üòÇüòÇ. I was just shocked! üò≤üò≤ Gen Z will never know how gigantic Janet was in her peak. She was the it girl for the MTV video era, and still had to compete with her brother, Madonna, Mariah, Prince and Whitney, and still was #1. 
Janet Jackson was and still is one of the best performers that ever existed on pop history and she got hurt really bad by what happend. What I feel is that a mistake happend with two persons on a national television event and only one got their career affect by that. 
An older lady had invited us over to have a super bowl party and watch the game on her big screen. When that happened the youth pastor just covered his face with his hands and ran out of the room lol

FX and Hulu set to launch ‚ÄòMalfunction: The Dressing Down of Janet Jackson‚Äô on Nov. 19. It tells the story of 2004 halftime show, ‚Äúwhich saw Timberlake briefly expose Jackson‚Äôs breast to millions. Jackson‚Äôs career never recovered but Timberlake went from strength-to-strength.‚Äù 
That incident is one of my favorite examples of the difference between the US and Canada. The FCC received hundreds of thousands of complaints from Americans about the nipple, while the CRTC (FCC equivalent in Canada) received 2 complaints during that Superbowl - and both were for sexism in the commercials. </p>
