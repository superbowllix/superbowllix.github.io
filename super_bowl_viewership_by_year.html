        <p>The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until

This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
The average viewership number for this Super Bowl was 114,810,000. The air date for Super Bowl XLIX was on February 1, 2015. 2. Super Bowl LVII: Kansas City Chiefs vs Philadelphia Eagles.

The longest Super Bowl game will also go down as the most-watched program in U.S. television history. According to Nielsen and Adobe Analytics, Kansas City’s 25-22 overtime victory over San Francisco averaged 123.7 million viewers across television and streaming platforms. 
The Super Bowl proved to be a record-breaking culmination of an already historically impressive year for NFL games—matchups during the 2023 regular season drew an average of 17.9 million 
The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. An additional 2.3 million viewers watched the Spanish-language broadcast on Univision, and 1.2 million tuned in to watch the kid-friendly broadcast on Nickelodeon and Nick-at-Nite. 
Super Bowl LVII was also the most-streamed Super Bowl in history, per FOX, with 7 million streams, up 18% over last year's game, and the most-watched Super Bowl game in Spanish-language cable TV  
The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). Men 18-24 placed second with a 20% increase (from 3.86 to 4.61 million) and girls 12-17 third with an 11% jump (from 2.63 to 2.85 million). 
Last year’s Super Bowl set a record with an average audience of 123.7 million viewers on CBS, Nickelodeon, Univision and streamed on Paramount+. 
NFL recorded an international viewership of 62.5 million in 2023 for the Super Bowl. This figure excluded the domestic viewership of 123.4 million viewers in the United States. Of the recorded international viewers in 2023, 24.1 million viewers were from Mexico, the highest viewership recorded since the game began and a 5% increase compared to

"Nielsen has measured Super Bowl viewership for over 50 years giving us a front row seat to the vast changes in how and where fans watch the Big Game," said Jon Stainer, Nielsen Global Sports  
Sunday’s overtime thriller, which featured the Kansas City Chiefs facing off against the San Francisco 49ers, averaged 123.4 million viewers, CBS said Monday, breaking Super Bowl viewership records. 
Sunday’s performance also capped off a big year for N.F.L. ratings. Viewership was up 7 percent, according to Nielsen, falling just shy of the record set in 2015. 
"More than 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all or part of Super Bowl LVIII across networks, the highest unduplicated total audience in history and up +10% vs. last year’s Super Bowl," the  
Over the years, I have seen Super Bowl streaming numbers misreported with numbers that have no source to them and don’t match the numbers put out each year by the broadcast networks.
