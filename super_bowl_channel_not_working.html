At 14:23 in quarter 1 of super bowl I get the spinning wheel "hang tight" and then video is lost. Done. — Jeremy Wojtecki (@jwojPAC) February 11, 2024 Edward Sutelan 
By Phillip Swann The TV Answer Man –Follow on X. Former editor of 4 TV magazines. Author of TV Dot Com. It turned out to be a great night for the Kansas City Chiefs. But not so much for streaming. Last night’s Super Bowl, won by the Chiefs in overtime, 25-22, was marred by numerous streaming glitches on multiple providers. 
No, Super Bowl 59 will not stream on Peacock. The game is being broadcast on Fox, which will prevent Peacock – which is NBC's proprietary streaming service – from broadcasting the game. 
ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - If your Paramount+ stream isn’t working during Super Bowl LVIII, you’re not alone. Users on X, formerly Twitter, are reporting widespread outages as the service seemingly cracks under the strain of one of the world’s most popular sporting events. 
Paramount+ users have been reporting problems accessing CBS’s streaming service since about 5 p.m. ET, a time when many were hoping to catch pregame coverage of the Super Bowl. 
1. Change the channel. Then, go back to your original channel or show. This will sometimes allow your original channel or show to ‘catch up’ with the data (programming) that’s being delivered to your home. In the case of the Super Bowl, just exit the live feed and then go back in. 2. Reset your home WiFi network. 
Some viewers of Super Bowl 58 are having trouble, well, watching the Super Bowl. The Feb. 11 game is broadcast exclusively on CBS and Nickelodeon, and streaming only on Paramount+, a streaming  
The 2nd tv is def worse. Normally we could have 3 tvs and an iPad w the same football game running w no issue. I did NOT upgrade to 4k bc I didn’t want to chance streaming issues. I wish our damned antenna worked. 2nd Edit: Gave up on 2nd tv stream. I’ll just grill our wings out here without it. 
Paramount+ users have been reporting problems accessing CBS’s streaming service since about 5 p.m. ET, a time when many were hoping to catch pregame coverage of the Super Bowl. 
It was the dedicated streaming selection for the Super bowl. I opened up Paramount Plus (phone app, PC / web browser and TV VR Roku) and top center is the Super Bowl banner taking up almost whatever view you have. In the lower left of the Savannah is the WATCH NOW . Clicked on it and Face The Nation showed up instead of the Super bowl. 
Tubi offers a vast library of movies and TV shows – and in 2025, it will be the streaming home of Super Bowl LIX. If you’re encountering issues with the Tubi app not working properly, most of the time you can fix the issues and get back up and running with minimal frustration. 
TV Schedule for Super Bowl LIX. While the game doesn’t kick off until 6:30 p.m., pregame coverage will start in the early afternoon. The last time FOX aired the Super Bowl, coverage began at 1 p  
The Superdome last hosted the Super Bowl in 2013, when John Harbaugh's Baltimore Ravens defeated Jim Harbaugh's San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in Super Bowl 47. Famously, that game featured a 34-minute  
We have the national affiliate as our local affiliate so OTA conversion was not the case. YouTubeTV has always looked as good or (possibly) better than OTA on these channels. Before the game it was affecting numerous channels, my initial thought was that YouTubeTV was throttling at the CDN. It's possible it was per-channel. 
The Super Bowl will be shown for free on Fox Sports on Sunday. Until Sunday, Fox Sports is not free. Sometimes you will get a free preview but this is normally a subscription channel and you need tv provider credentials to access (an account). Fox Sports is waiving this account requirement for the Super Bowl event only. 
Some 2,000 law enforcement officers will be working in the area to ensure safety during the Super Bowl events. No vehicle traffic will be allowed on Bourbon Street, and the city will block  
What Channel Is the Super Bowl On? The 2025 Super Bowl LIX will be broadcast on FOX in the United States. The game rotates through the four major US TV networks—ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC—and this year is FOX's turn. The 2026 Super Bowl will be broadcast on NBC. 
Yes, because not everyone can get CBS and I live in a metropolitan, large city. I get NBC, PBS, and a bunch of random Mexican channels. Fox is intermittent and I have to be precise with the antenna to even get it. Doesn't matter what antenna I use. I would expect my internet to be pretty damn near close. Not to be confrontational. </p>
