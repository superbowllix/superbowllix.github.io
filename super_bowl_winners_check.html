        <h2><strong>super bowl winners check michael jackson sister super bowl</strong></h2>
        <p>As Chiefs know quite well, in addition to being able to call themselves Super Bowl champions and wear increasingly gaudy jewelry, NFL players receive a bonus check for playing in the big game  
The bonus associated with playing in the Super Bowl grows each year, according to the agreement. Last year the winners’ bonus was $157,000. Next year, it’s set to rise to $171,000. By the 2030-31 football season (the last seasons covered in the most recent bargaining agreement), the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000. 
Back in the first Super Bowl, the winner was paid $15,000, and the loser $7,500. However, when adjusted for inflation, that equates to roughly $117,000 and $59,000 in 2022. Therefore, the change in pay for playing in or winning the Super Bowl has not increased so substantially over the years relative to the current market. 
Do Winners of the Super Bowl Get Paid Extra? It’s true: Winners of every Super Bowl also make an extra paycheck and receive a unique ring for that game. In terms of the paycheck, it’s substantial. The winner of Super Bowl LIX will receive a bonus worth $171,000. The loser will receive $96,000. 
According to the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement, each eligible player on the Chiefs’ roster will receive a check for $164,000 for being on the winning team in the Super Bowl. 
According to the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement, each eligible player on the Chiefs’ roster will receive a check for $164,000 for being on the winning team in the Super Bowl. Feb 12, 2024 
Super Bowl winner: $164,000 Super Bowl loser: $89,000 If the Chiefs win the 2024 Super Bowl, players collecting the full amount of every bonus check will have earned an extra $338,000. 
For the 2023 Super Bowl (2022-23 season), winners of the NFL’s finale will receive a $157,000 bonus. Players also get bonuses for winning earlier playoff rounds, so the maximum bonus for playoff success in 2023 would be $320,000 for a player who plays in every postseason game and wins the Super Bowl. 
The 2023 Super Bowl winners earned $164,000, while members of the winning team in 2022 received $157,000—so you can see it goes up a bit each year. This year's cash bonus is up more than $40,000 from 2020, when the winners of the Super Bowl each took home $130,000. 
For the 2022-23 NFL playoffs, Wild Card teams are paid $41,500 and division winners are paid $46,500 for Wild Card games. Despite not playing a game, players on first-round bye teams still receive  
How much would the Eagles make for winning Super Bowl?. Under the NFL's current collective bargaining agreement (Article 37, Section 5), each player on the winning team in Super Bowl 59 will

New Orleans is buzzing with Super Bowl LIX excitement, offering fan events, interactive experiences, live music, and food leading up to the championship game. 
In addition to a ring and a permanent place in history, players on the winning and losing Super Bowl teams also receive a sizable bonus check. This money comes from an NFL postseason pool, not individual teams, according to "Money" magazine. 
Just that one check – for winners or losers – also easily tops the median U.S. household income, which is around $74,580.  the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000.
