        <p>Orleans has a watch party in Mardi gra ballroom for between $250-$350 all you can eat and drink I believe, Westgate has Big Game party in a banquet room for about $275 all you can eat and halftime raffles . I‚Äôve seen a lot of pictures and YouTube videos of the one at Westgate but no reviews or videos of the Orleans and watch party. 
The atmosphere of Westgates watch party was awesome, drink service was great but the food was terrible. Virgil‚Äôs was a good spot for us so we went two years in a row before trying out Westgate. The food is good, they‚Äôve changed their liquor to just above well so that‚Äôs why we stopped going.

Unlike the Stanley cup or World Series or nba ship, the Super Bowl is a fairly lackluster event in person. It‚Äôs not a particularly electric crowd environment, it‚Äôs sickeningly expensive, and the fanfare is underwhelming for the trouble. I would rather do Vegas and Super Bowl separately than try to combine them. 
First time in Vegas for the Super Bowl. Usually at Tahoe and they have a buffet with drinks at one of the ballrooms or halls. They have anything like that in Vegas? I know there's viewing parties at the restaurants and bars, but can't find anything on a larger scale in Vegas. I've seen videos of Aria and MGM having them but not the Caesers  
Super last minute but I have decided to go to Vegas for the Super Bowl. Anyone know of watch parties that are 18 and older and not sold out? I‚Äôm willing to do a first come first serve. 
Wife and I driving up for the weekend, will watch the game from a watch party. Looking at Biggest Big Game Bash 2024 - Downtown Las Vegas Events Center (dlvec.com) but all the 4 seaters are sold out.

I‚Äôll be visiting Vegas during the Super Bowl weekend with a group of friends (we‚Äôre all in our early 30‚Äôs) and we‚Äôre trying to find a good place to watch the game and party for a little after maybe? We would like something a bit different than just a sports bar but anything could work really. Do you have any suggestions? 
Will be in Vegas this Sunday for super bowl tickets are super expensive so obviously not going to the game where would you recommend for free super bowl watch parties I have been before and I know there are some that are for purchase and we also had went to a few that were actually free not too sure now since covid and inflation have hit ? </p>
