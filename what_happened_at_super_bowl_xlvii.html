Mercedes-Benz Superdome following Super Bowl XLVII. This was the 49ers' second Super Bowl played at the Superdome—the first being Super Bowl XXIV when they beat the Denver Broncos 55–10. The 49ers, Broncos and New England Patriots are the only teams so far to play two or more Super Bowls at the Superdome. The 49ers also joined the Broncos  
The Superdome in New Orleans was rocking after the Baltimore Ravens had just scored the longest touchdown in Super Bowl history. But just moments after Jacoby Jones had lit up Super Bowl 47, the

The last time the Superdome hosted a Super Bowl, the lights went out in the middle of the third quarter, causing a 34-minute delay. This is the story of how it happened. 
New Orleans is hosting the Super Bowl for the first time since 2013, when a 34-minute power outage delayed the second half of the Ravens' win over the 49ers in Super Bowl 47. 
Super Bowl XLVII was a game that will be remembered forever. The San Francisco 49ers faced off against the Baltimore Ravens.This game marked the first time that two brothers met in the Super Bowl  
The next Super Bowl, the Seahawks got turnovers early, but they weren't turned into points. Once Seattle got up early, the odds of a comeback were extremely small. What little hope they had was dashed at the opening kickoff. To date, it's the only Super Bowl I haven't watched in its entirety since I started watching football. 
The Super Bowl will be held in New Orleans for the first time since 2013, when a power outage delayed the game and gave birth to a conspiracy theory. 
On Sunday, Feb. 3, 2013, with an estimated 108.4 million people watching the Super Bowl on live TV, half of the lights in the Superdome promptly and unexpectedly went out. In the ensuing minutes
