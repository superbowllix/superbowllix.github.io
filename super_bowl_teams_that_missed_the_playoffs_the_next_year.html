        <p>That team finished 8-8, but Pittsburgh rebounded the next year with a 10-6 record and a trip back to the playoffs, where they were one-and-done. Three seasons removed from their Super Bowl win

More than half the time, both teams make the playoffs next season (51.9 percent of the time) and only 9.6 percent of the time have both Super Bowl teams missed the playoffs the next season. 
The home-field curse is said to affect a team if the Super Bowl is played at its home stadium. As of 2024, only two teams have played the Super Bowl in their stadiums, the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs for Super Bowl LV and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams against the Cincinnati Bengals for Super Bowl LVI at their new home, SoFi Stadium; both host  
Only eight teams in NFL history -- the 1971 Cowboys, '72 Dolphins, the '73 Vikings, the '87 Broncos, the 1991-93 Bills and the 2018 Patriots-- have returned to the Super Bowl the year after losing  
After a two-year hiatus from the Super Bowl, Pittsburgh once again won consecutive titles to cap off the 1978 and 1979 campaigns. The 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos and New England Patriots are the other four franchises to win two Super Bowls in a row. How many NFL teams missed the playoffs after winning the Super Bowl? 
Won Super Bowl XXIII and Super Bowl XXIV. 1990 season: San Francisco won its first 10 games and rolled to the NFC West title with a 14-2 record. After beating Washington 28-10 in the NFC  
The root of the 49ers' Super Bowl hangover is easy to pinpoint. Injuries pulverized this team. Nick Bosa, Deebo Samuel, George Kittle, and Jimmy Garoppolo missed much of the season, a 6-10 campaign.

Out of the first 57 Super Bowl losers, 40 came back to make the playoffs the next season. The 70.2% playoff rate would refute the notion of a Super Bowl jinx.

Below is the timeline of each Super Bowl winning teams playoff status the next year. Winning Super Bowl teams have missed the playoffs 32% of the time the next season. I mentioned earlier, that since 1998, the losing team has missed the next playoffs the next season at an elevated rate in recent years (nine years missed in the last 18 years).
