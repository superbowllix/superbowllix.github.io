Mahomes’ three Super Bowl MVP honors equal the three earned by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, who was honored after the team’s titles in 1982, 1983 and 1990. 
Walt Disney World has announced that they will host the Super Bowl Super Bowl LIX this year with the event being held in New Orleans. The parade will be on Monday, February 10th and it traditionally features the MVP of the Super Bowl.
