        <h2><strong>super bowl vs champions league final reddit super bowl viewership numbers</strong></h2>
        <p>The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
Considering one is only really watched in one country and the other is consumed globally I'm going to go with the UCL. The 2021 Champions League final brought in 700 million viewers compared to the 2022 Super Bowl's 112 million. 
Yeah, major soccer finals such as the UEFA Champions League Final have and probably always will be viewed by more people than the Superbowl, simply because the NFL is a uniquely American sport, and soccer appeals to a much wider fan base all around the world. 
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
The Champions League final vs. Super Bowl argument rages on between football and soccer (also known as “football”) fans. It’s the biggest game of the season in either sport, as the Super Bowl is the marquee matchup in the United States, while the Champions League final rules the parts of the world, where soccer reigns supreme. 
The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to date.A  
The 2024 UEFA Champions League final brings the curtain down on European club football before attention turns to Euro 2024 in Germany and the 2024 Copa America in the United States. 
Super Bowl 2023: Kansas City Chiefs vs. Philadelphia Eagles The Chiefs beat the Eagles in Super Bowl 2023 by a score of 38-35. The game saw a reported 115.1 million viewers tune into the game 
Champions League is nothing like this, there is no commercials or halftime show hoopla, very few women watch and Champions League Final parties with children and wifes making themed snacks aren't common. Its very much an event for soccer fans, and soccer is the only focus. So it really depends on how many fans the two competing teams have. 
Real Madrid won a record 15th Champions League title by beating Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in the final in June – Maciej Rogowski / SOPA Images/Sipa USA – Photo by Icon Sport The case for the Champions League final. When it comes to a global audience, the Champions League final’s reach dwarfs that of the Super Bowl. 
The Super Bowl may take the top spot next week, but it'll be knocked off in May when the CL final is played on a Saturday for the first time. I had to take a day off of work to watch it and I know a lot of soccer fans here in California that weren't able to watch it because of work. 
Combined Twitter Following: 25.5M (Champions League) vs. 2.22M (Super Bowl) Champions League has over 10x the number of Twitter followers but only third of the total tweets. According to my quick math, Super Bowl viewers are tweeting 38 times more per Twitter follower compared to Champions League viewers. 
TIL The most popular annual sporting event in the world is not the Super Bowl. Instead, it is the final match of a soccer event called the "UEFA Champions League" pledgesports.org Open 
But to your comment, yea, Champions League final may be Europe's "Super Bowl," but the game still isn't on the production level of say the NBA finals or Super Bowl, but a lot of soccer fans like it that wayit's more simple and to the point. Not near as much fluff and off-field segments as American sports. 
The article does not say how many viewers watched the champios league final or super bowl. A quick google search gives: Champions league final - 380 million IPL final - 174 million Super Bowl - 114 million. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event of the year by a wide margin. People who haven’t watched a single NFL game all year will plan Super Bowl parties. That’s not to say that people consciously think ‘winning the Super Bowl is more impressive than winning the NBA Finals’. But way more people care about the former than the latter.

"The Super Bowl is watched by an average of just under 100 million viewers in the US, with another 30-50 million tuning in from other countries." "The Champions League final usually attracts between 380 and 400 million viewers who tune in outside the stadium where the game is played."

I understand that, but the NFL has successfully turned the Super Bowl into a non-sporting event and defacto national holiday. I would be willing to bet that 4 out of 5 people "watching the game" either don't know what's going on or don't care enough to learn. The Champions League (pretty much the Super Bowl of soccer) is in a similar position. </p>
