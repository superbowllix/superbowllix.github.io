Trivia timeout: Can you name the four schools that have produced a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and a U.S. president?  Didn't think so, but that's about to change  The answers: The U.S  
But here’s what the exercise taught me. How many schools have had multiple Super Bowl-winning QBs. It’s amazing how some schools have excelled at producing the triggerman in the 45 Super Bowls.

Flacco won Super Bowl XLVII and the game’s MVP over the 49ers in 2012 while a member of the Ravens. That was Joe Douglas’s second Super Bowl as a member of the Ravens, where he was a scout  
His counting numbers in Super Bowl competition are the stuff of lore; he's the all-time leader in Super Bowl passing touchdowns (21), completions (277), attempts (421) and passing yards (3,039).

Herbert Clark Hoover (August 10, 1874 – October 20, 1964) was an American politician who served as the 31st president of the United States from 1929 to 1933. He was a member of the Republican Party, holding office during the onset of the Great Depression in the United States.
