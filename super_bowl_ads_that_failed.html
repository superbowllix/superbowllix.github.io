        <p>The brand topped Super Bowl ad rankings in 2014 with “Puppy Love,” and again with “Lost Dog” in 2015, two ads that at least introduce some stakes as well as context to the relationship  
Thanks to Ad Meter data, there are a bunch of commercials that have gotten some awful grades. Worth noting: with Ad Meter moving to a 1-to-5 rating system in 2025, these are from the 1-to-10 scale. 
SalesGenie's 2008 Super Bowl ad is well animated, features adorable panda characters, and is also racist in ways that offended many. The ad is set in Ling Ling's Bamboo Furniture Shack, where Ling  
The Super Bowl is known for delivering some of the most iconic commercials in history—but not every ad is a touchdown. Some fumble so hard they leave audienc 
While many commercials during Super Bowl 58 resonated positively with audiences, a few failed to hit the mark, receiving lower ratings from the Kellogg panel. 1. Temu: During Super Bowl 58, Temu, a Chinese shopping app, aired a repetitive animated commercial multiple times, featuring people receiving low-priced items, but it drew criticism for  
3. Just-for-Feet. Some brands, like Just-for-Feet, have it worse–by actually receiving negative feedback. In 1999, the sportswear brand ran a Super Bowl ad that showed a runner from Kenya being  
The Super Bowl of advertising is, after all, the Super Bowl. There are, however, significant downsides to awfulness. On a corporate level, a failed advertising campaign can meaningfully hurt a  
The Worst Super Bowl Ads of All Time. The Super Bowl has been a powerful platform for advertisers since its launch in 1968. Even in the very first year of the event, companies paid $150,000 for one minute of ad coverage. With 58 years of commercials, there are some memorable Super Bowl ad flops. Let’s look at some of the worst Super Bowl ads  
To mix sports metaphors, Super Bowl ads are often about taking big swings that are as likely to end in a strikeout as a home run. As is often the case, many of the game's most discussed efforts were described by industry experts as both the best and worst of what advertisers had to offer — another test for brands on whether all engagement is  
Reprising the stunt from last year, where the four-time Super Bowl champion tight end tried — and failed — to make a 25-yard field goal, this year’s commercial featured Gronk failing again. In a teaser for the series of ads released early, Rocky co-star Carl Weathers was shown riding up on a motorcycle to encourage Gronkowski. After  
The median effectiveness score for 48 Super Bowl ads from 2014 measured by Communicus was 64.5. That compares to 100 as the average in the database for the company, which does similar ratings of TV ads for clients year round. Communicus didn’t evaluate all the Super Bowl ads, but did get all that were known to be coming before the game.

The Super Bowl ad could be considered a crowning achievement for both a brand and an agency. After all, it is the world’s most expensive advertising venue with this year 30-second buy in being  
A look at the top Super Bowl ads, and those that missed the mark 05:10. As the Kansas City Chiefs took on the San Francisco 49ers in Sunday's Super Bowl thriller, some of the world's top brands  
While the ad may have been entertaining, it failed to deliver on brand promotion or recall—a key aspect of any successful ad. A lot of money was spent on the ad time and Christopher Walken, but it is hard to see how any of this benefits BMW. Watch BMW’s Super Bowl ad featuring Christopher Walken. 
Forget what all those ad executives tweeting on #brandbowl and #whartonfoa told you last night: There were 87 commercials during last night’s Super Bowl, but very few of them failed to meaningfully connect their message to their social media platforms. 
In 1999, a few months after the company went public, it aired a self-proclaimed “Worst Ad on the Super Bowl” during Super Bowl XXXIV, featuring typewriter text against a yellow background  
20 years ago, 11 different startups spent millions of dollars to run 30-second ads during the Super Bowl, reports the Hustle. Within one year 8 of the 11 companies "had either gone bankrupt or been sold in fire sales." The how-to platform Computer.com spent $3m of its $5.8m in seed funding on an

The Super Bowl is one of the biggest party days of the year. Fans gather to laugh with friends and families. That’s why getting super-serious (or worse) in Super Bowl commercials can backfire. Just ask Nationwide. The insurance giant was trying to focus attention on the tragedy of childhood deaths from preventable household accidents. </p>
