        <p>The controversy comes from multiple angles. The most charitable angle: Having a unified national identity is crucial to a functioning democracy, especially when it’s a multiethnic one. Many people who believe in a unified national identity believe that attempts to “celebrate” diversity can actually heighten divisions, erode shared experience and identity, and deepen “us v them” thin 
Lip syncing does not take away from her still singing that song nor that rendition. It is frequently the top ranked Super Bowl anthem performance for a reason. All that being said, Stapleton's is probably the best rendition I have seen in my own lifetime. 
A bit of nuance here, but this so called 'black national anthem' isn't inherently exclusive to black people. I still think it's a dumb thing to be played alongside the Star-Spangled Banner, but the actual song is called "Lift Every Voice and Sing" and has zero mention of race in it. It's also been played at the Super Bowl for the past few years. 
Here's a glimpse at the history of national anthem at the Super Bowl, including the best and worst performances all time, plus a complete list of every singer from 1967 to 2025. 
7. Christina Aguilera -- Super Bowl XLV (Feb. 6, 2011) AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Christina Aguilera became a global pop star with the 1999 release of her self-titled debut album. 
The Super Bowl pregame will have some Louisiana flavor: Jon Batiste will hit the stage to sing the national anthem, while Trombone Shorty and Lauren Daigle are slated to perform “America the  
The Super Bowl national anthem has been performed on trumpet on five occasions (Lloyd Geisler in 1969, Doc Severinsen in 1970, Tommy Loy in 1971, Wynton Marsalis in 1986, Herb Alpert in 1988).  
NFL fans are calling for a Super Bowl boycott after it was revealed the 'Black National Anthem' will be performed ahead of this weekend's big game in New Orleans. 
Year. Super Bowl. Anthem Performer. 2025. Super Bowl LIX. Jon Batiste. 2024. Super Bowl LVIII. Reba McEntire. 2023. Super Bowl LVII. Chris Stapleton. 2022. Super Bowl LVI 
The average length of the Super Bowl national anthem since 191 is 115.6 seconds (1 minute and 55.6 seconds). How long was the national anthem at the last Super Bowl? 
The shortest anthem that I found documented for the Super Bowl was 1:25 by Aaron Neville in 1990. In the past 20 years the Dixie Chicks in 2003 gave us a 1:33 anthem and Kelly Clarkson was 1:34 9 years ago. 
There are two answers: One is Whitney Houston at the 1991 Super Bowl, as others will certainly mention. The other isn't even the Star Spangled Banner. It's Ray Charles performing "America the Beautiful". 
The Star Spangled Banner really separates performers. Obviously the Super Bowl anthem is a giant promotional opportunity and so the most talented performers aren't always chosen to sing. But still, I've seen some really great singers get up there and give it absolutely everything and come across "decent." 
Opening this as I was unable to find a relevant one for this year's SuperBowl national anthem prop. This is a crowd favorite and I assume there will be more people interested in this. So National Anthem bettors, please share your bets, your opinions, your whatever info the community might find interesting. 
The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of achievement for their careers and a lot of them have dreamt about what it would be like to play/coach in a Super Bowl since they were kids. Combine their dreams, plus the pressure of the moment, and a good rendition of a song that does carry emotional weight - it’s not hard to see why they might have some  
Like it was such a big deal. They also had America the Beautiful and the National Anthem and a video about Hawaii for no apparent reason and the flyover of a closed stadium and an awkward speech for Man of the Year finalists and sign language interpreters and too many commercials and all kinds of stuff. 
One other big thing about this is that this year is the 50th anniversary of the moment she essentially got “discovered”singing the national anthem at the National Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City. Country artist Red Steagall heard her and was impressed, and that led her to Nashville and the recording of her first demo tape. 
TIL Whitney Houston’s iconic National Anthem performance at the 1991 Super Bowl was lip synced. However the vocal track she used was recorded in a single take. 
The UK need to change their national anthem to Rule Britannia (problematic because of colonialism but a very good song that spit epitomizes the country) or Land of hope and Glory. That way the United States can use My Country Tis of Thee which would lyrically be the best national anthem. 
Because it was the peak of our fossil fuel powered civilization. It was our peak affluence before oil and other resources started becoming harder to find, the internet ripped apart our social fabric and our debt based money system really started to fall to pieces (well you could argue that it started with the '87 crash but we thought it was just an anomaly not a feature). </p>
