Tom Brady's decision was a central reason why companies no longer give out cars to the MVP Credit: Getty. Mahomes, this year's Super Bowl MVP, wasn't given a new car because of a flurry of contract decisions made by the NFL and its sponsors. Chevrolet had secured deals with the NFL as the motor sponsor of the sport. 
From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car as a part of their MVP award. However, since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50. [13] 
The Korean automaker wasn’t so keen on handing out free cars, putting an end to the Super Bowl giveaway and only once handing out a pair of Genesis coupes to the MVPs of the Pro Bowl. Advertisement 
The prize for his MVP performance was a blue Dodge Charger R/T, complete with a snarling 440-cid V8. “That’s why I call the MVP car a win-win-win,” Namath explained. “Even Uncle Sam gets his cut.” While the first years of the Super Bowl coincided with the heyday of American muscle, not every MVP was so fired up about receiving a  
One Super Bowl tradition came to an end a couple years ago when the NFL stopped giving the game’s MVP a brand new car. But over the years MVPs drove off in some of the nicest cars and trucks available at that time. Here are a few of those lucky guys and their rides. Bart Starr – 1967 &amp; 68 
As I’ve blogged since 2019 on this blog and every year since, I’ve confirmed the Super Bowl MVP doesn’t get a car.. In fact, the last time a Super Bowl MVP won a car was in 2015 when Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady won a 2015 Chevrolet Colorado from GM and then turned around and re-gifted it to Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler, the arguable hero of the that particular game. 
The Super Bowl MVP receives a trophy, as no cash prize is attached to the award. However, winners used to receive a car, but the tradition was discontinued in 2015. That year, Tom Brady gifted

From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX, MVP winners received a new car as part of their prize. However, this tradition ended when Hyundai became the official NFL sponsor in 2015 . 
He led the team to a Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl LIV, earning the Super Bowl MVP award for his performance. Mahomes is known for his work ethic, leadership, and community involvement off the field, contributing to his status as one of the league’s most respected and popular players. Also, Patrick Mahomes won the Super Bowl MVP in 2024  
That’s because Ford is the “Official Truck of Super Bowl LVI.” If Super Bowl LVI MVP did get a free car this year, it’d probably be a 2022 Ford Lightning Platinum electric truck, since this year marks the first year Ford is delivering pre-ordered Lightnings to customers. 
Super Bowl MVPs have been getting cars for decades, but here’s why Patrick Mahomes probably won’t get a car this year. Every year, moments after the Super Bowl MVP gets their trophy, NFL fans across the world wonder if a car manufacturer rep will step up to say a few words before rewarding the big game’s star player with a set of keys to a brand new car (or truck or SUV) parked just off

Up until 2015, Super Bowl MVP winners were also given a free car. Tom Brady, after winning the award for his Super Bowl 49 performance, was the last Super Bowl MVP to be given a free vehicle.

Some fans may be taken aback when they find out that the Super Bowl MVP isn’t getting a free vehicle after the game. However, this prize isn’t the common practice it once was. </p>
