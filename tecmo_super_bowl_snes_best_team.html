        <h2><strong>tecmo super bowl snes best team chiefs super bowl parade pictures</strong></h2>
        <p>I've found a lot of discussion on the best teams in the NES version but since the rosters are different on the SNES and Sega versions of Tecmo Super Bowl which teams are the best and which are the worsts? 
3. Houston Oilers: That the Oilers are the actual best team in the AFC is somewhere between ‘open secret’ and ‘not any sort of secret, whatsoever’ among TSB veterans. This is entirely because of their nuclear-hot passing game. Warren Moon is arguably the best QB in the whole game, possessing an arm that’s both powerful and accurate. 
Among the Tecmo Super Bowl community, it is common for distinguished groups/tournament organizers (such as the Tomczak Bowl) to create tier lists, rankings of a teams's potential in tournaments. Tomczak Bowl uses a tier system of play. Teams are grouped into tiers of five based on their overall strength of play. Tier 1 is reserved for the best teams while Tier 5 is for the not so great. All 28  
For Tecmo Super Bowl on the Super Nintendo, Roster FAQ by Toad22484.  wanted a quick reference guide to all the tecmo teams players and Ratings, so I decided to  
Yeah I did, too, at first. But really look at their defense. Fulcher is a superstar and I gave him 125 points, higher than any other player in the game except Jerry Rice, and Francis is slightly above average (a lot of guys have at least 31 RS and 44 RP), but other than that it sucks. 
umm.. what brudd said. lol. i used to use DL a lot before i found this board, so I would like to add that Jacob Green is a good DL on the Seahawks, the Raiders have the best DL in the game with Long and Townsend and another 69hp guy at NT, William Perry, Gerald Williams and Jerry Ball are the next best NTs after Bob Nelson, and Reggie White is about the same as Long. 
Top Kick Returners &gt; Craig Heyward RB1 #34; Merril Hoge RB1 #33; Warren Williams RB2 #42; Tim Worley RB3 #38; Richard Bell RB4 #21 
This list ranks the 28 teams in Tecmo Super Bowl based on my subjective assessment of their quality. While player ratings and abilities play a huge role in my assessments, it is still subjective in the purest sense. I have made no effort to compile overall ratings for any teams, or otherwise ground these rankings statistically. 
27. Indianapolis Colts: I had no kind words for the Seahawks whatsoever, but believe it or don’t, there’s still one final, soul-crushing drop-off in overall team quality. This is it. We’ve reached the absolute nadir of Tecmo Super Bowl teams. The Colts and Patriots are widely acknowledged as the two worst teams in the game. 
Denver because it’s vintage John Elway and they are my favorite team. The best team is probably the Giants because Otis Anderson is the closest to Bo Jackson in the original Tecmo Bowl. Tacklers fly off him. I hate that Jim Kelly is QB Bills but Buffalo is a monster team as well. 
I am interested in getting opinions on the best teams for man v man games for TSB and why. This is inherently subjective, and the list below is just my personal preferences for who I would prefer to pick man games. I would value hearing where/why people may disagree. I would also be very interest 
Tecmo Super Bowl Decades-1990s (TSBD90) is a culmination of the 1990-1999 Legacy Series (LS90). TSBD90 is a dual game pack featuring all the best teams from LS90. Both game files provide the following gameplay elements: - All mini/large helmets to include team logos have been touched up to remove muddy textures and unnecessary shading. 
Please post what you think are the top 5 best teams in SNES - Tecmo Super Bowl TOP 5. 1. SF. 2. BUF. 3. DAL. 4. HOU. 5. PIT. Edited March 27, 2013 by 8-bit 
If no players make the Super Bowl, the token pool stays until the next year, making the next person to win a Super Bowl even more fortunate. SECOND SEASON AND SUBSEQUENT SEASONS After the first season, reactivate all the player teams as Man, then begin the season again, letting players build up their teams from where the last season ended. 
The first Tecmo Super Bowl bowl on the SNES is the best of the SNES bunch. I remember renting Final Edition and being like "WTF this sucks". The NES Tecmo Super Bowl is the best version. 
For celebrating the 20 Years since the release of Tecmo Super Bowl III I created this ROM. Best teams of every franchise in the LAST 20 YEARS (1996 - 2015) Players and values based in Pro Football Reference records. Playbooks adjusted to maximize the players. Formations, Defense and Offense according to real life.

Tecmo Super Bowl [a] is an American football video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) that was released in December 1991. Developed by Tecmo, it is the first sports video game that was licensed by both the National Football League and the National Football League Players Association, thus allowing the game to use both the names and attributes of real NFL teams and real NFL players. </p>
