        <p>There some records in sports physically not possible anymore due to rule changes or how the game has changed. Like Cy Young's win record, 3 straight no hitters, Gretzky's point record, and stuff like that. 5 straight Super Bowl losses is breakable. NE went to 4 of 5 from 2014 to 2018.

The Niners played every game in the playoffs badly. They almost lost the the 7 seed Packers, and to the Lions, and they’re supposedly “the best team in the NFL”. I don’t like him, but Mahomes knows what he is doing. Combine that with the Niners being overrated and “viola”. Another Super Bowl. 
I listened to an hour long podcast about Super Bowl betting trends and every stat that was thrown out favored the Chiefs. The 49ers have failed to cover the spread 3 straight games. Teams on a 3 game losing streak ATS rarely cover in the Super Bowl.

My heart wants Cincy to win but I think the Rams experience in the Super Bowl will give them the slight edge. I have this game playing out like Pittsburgh/Arizona SB43 did. A couple of exciting late lead changes, but ultimately the Rams come out on top. SUPER BOWL 56 
Super Bowl Winner's defense was on average ranked 6.92 places higher than the MVP. The largest difference was both 2017 and 2018, in which the Super Bowl Winner's defense was 22nd places higher than the MVP Best defense to win the Super Bowl; tied 2013 Broncos/2015 Panthers. 
Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money. 
Spags has been a part of three Super Bowl championship teams. CMC was not on the field in that last Super Bowl, and he stands to get 20-plus touches in this game. Samuel against Sneed will be a must-watch matchup. Kittle is the key player for the Niners, going up against Bolton, who was a star in last year’s Super Bowl.

But you can hedge out of futures for guaranteed profit. If the 9ers win this week, my +2500 super bowl ticket will be some easy guaranteed cash. I will agree that after the wildcard round, there's very little value on futures. At this point just bet individual games. 
Some might say that the Eagles path to the Super Bowl has been one of the easiest in history. They played a #6 seed and then they played a team without a QB. But that's not their fault.
