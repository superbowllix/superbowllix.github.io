        <p>The Super Bowl is famous for many things ranging from football and a star-studded halftime show to food and of course, epic commercials.

Ben Affleck's Boston-accented Dunkin' routine was a highlight of last year's Super Bowl ad slate, and now Affleck has higher ambitions than working the Dunkin' drive-thru.

Tide went meta when it bought an ad in every quarter of the 2018 Super Bowl. Each spot riffed a stereotypical Big Game commercial: a car ad, a beer ad, a deodorant ad, and more. 
Super Bowl food ads contain nearly 40% of the daily sodium limit -- too much salt can harm heart health, study finds. THURSDAY, Feb. 6, 2025 (HealthDay News) -- Set, hut! Super Bowl Sunday is almost here. 
Let’s dig in. The all about the eyeballs ad. More than 123 million people watched the Super Bowl in 2024, in the U.S. alone. The four games during NFL Divisional weekend this year averaged 36.6  
The Super Bowl is right around the corner, and companies have been waiting for months to debut their highly anticipated ads around the event. When it comes to food commercials, one not-so-healthy  
His team analyzed 10 NFL games from September to November 2023 and found that 10% of commercials featured food products. And the sodium content in those foods ranged from 220 mg to 1,872 mg
