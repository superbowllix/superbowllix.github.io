        <h2><strong>super bowl ratings vs world cup ratings vegas super bowl overtime odds</strong></h2>
        <p>The massive viewership numbers of the World Cup and Super Bowl pad the coffers of FIFA and the NFL respectively. FIFA has turned a profit of nearly $5 billion or more from the last three World Cups. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
The Super Bowl isn’t going to become the most-watched sporting event on Earth, and the FIFA World Cup — nor anything else — is likely going to oust the NFL title game from its domestic throne. 
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
The disciplines also have two of the most popular competitions. Dig in for a complete Super Bowl vs World Cup Finals comparison, focusing on fan participation, viewership, and revenue generated.

FIFA World Cup Final Beat Super Bowl LVI By More Than One BILLION Viewers In TV Ratings / FIFA has claimed that around 1.5 billion people watched the 2022 World Cup final live on television. 
[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
According to Roadtrips.com five billion people watch the World Cup Final, while the Super Bowl is actually the 8th most-watched event with 115 million views. Finishing above NFL's showpiece are the Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, Women's World Cup, Olympic Games, Winter Games and the Champions League Final. 
Last season’s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals, also on NBC, had a reported viewership of 208 million in the United States alone.. The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar  
It’s official: more people in the US are streaming the World Cup than this year’s Superbowl, so it’s no surprise sports channel ESPN this week reported a 46% increase in viewership in group  
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of  
To give you a sense of just how huge, we visualized a comparison of viewership, looking at how many people watched the Super Bowl this year compared with the number of viewers of the final match of the last World Cup. If you had any doubt about the popularity of soccer in the rest of the world, let those doubts be dashed: 
The latter broadcast led out of Super Bowl LVI. Prior to Sunday’s nail-biter, the most-watched match of this year’s World Cup was the Black Friday U.S.-England group stage draw, which averaged 18.7 million viewers across the two networks. 
Yes: Super Bowl viewership might exceed World Cup viewership on a single game basis, but World Cup viewership will be in the billions by 2026. Three North American countries, a new format, lots of  
A record 18,000 media credentials were issued for the World Cup in Qatar, according to FIFA. This weekend’s Super Bowl in Las Vegas will host over 6,000 credentialed members of the press. 
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of  
It's going to be easy to beat for the US in the 2031 world cup, I mean they first got knocked out from getting a direct space against a team that only went professional a season or two ago, Chile. Then they got knocked out by a team in the final qualification tournament of which most players play in the third tier of French rugby with exception  
Super Bowl 58 had an estimated 123.4 million viewers on average for the CBS broadcast alone, and was up 10 percent over last year's Super Bowl between the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. </p>
