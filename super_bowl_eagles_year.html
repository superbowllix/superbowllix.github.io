The Eagles have won just one Super Bowl during their franchise's history. That came in Super Bowl 52, which was played in 2018 as part of the 2017 NFL playoffs.

Philadelphia Eagles Playoff History. Team Names: Philadelphia Eagles, Phi/Pit Eagles/Steelers.  Super Bowl: 4 Games, 1-3 Championship (pre-1966): 4 Games, 3-1. 
The Philadelphia Eagles soared in this year’s NFC championship game to earn a Super Bowl 59 berth.  the team made it just two years ago to Super Bowl 57 to take on the Kansas City Chiefs in 2023.
