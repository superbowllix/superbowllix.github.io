        <p>2025 Super Bowl: Chiefs and Eagles ranked by tiers with shot at Hall of Fame; three locks at the top  Mahomes can help strengthen his argument by becoming the first starting QB to win three  
The Eagles weren’t sold on Hurts and considered making a move for another QB. But they stuck with him and he finished runner-up to Mahomes for NFL MVP in 2022 and nearly beat him in the Super Bowl. 
The Philadelphia Eagles made it to Super Bowl 59 with ease after routing the Washington Commanders 55-23 in the 2025 NFC championship game. Now, Philadelphia will turn its attention to the Kansas  
The upcoming Super Bowl is a rematch of two years ago, when the Chiefs edged the Eagles 38-35 in Glendale, Arizona. Last year, Kansas City beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime in Las Vegas. 
Led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, the Eagles’ offense was dynamic, with Hurts setting a Super Bowl record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (three) and amassing over 370 total yards. Though they didn’t claim the championship, the performance cemented Hurts as one of the NFL’s rising stars and showcased the team’s bright future. 
The Eagles entered the season 11-1 to win the Super Bowl and +550 to win the NFC. They were tied for the second favorites to win the NFC entering the season with the Lions, trailing the 49ers (+260). 
The Eagles (17-3) are aiming for their second Super Bowl title in five tries. Backup quarterback Nick Foles led them to a 41-33 victory over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots seven years ago. Foles presented owner Jeffrey Lurie with the Halas trophy. “We’re there to win it,” Lurie said about going back to the Super Bowl. 
This will be the Eagles’ fifth Super Bowl appearance, and their first since winning Super Bowl LII in 2018. Philadelphia boasts a strong postseason record, with four NFC titles and a reputation

The Eagles’ most recent Super Bowl win came in 2018 when they bested the New England Patriots with a 41-33 victory. (Pictured top: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes at the AFC  
The 2025 Super Bowl kickoff in New Orleans is at 6:30 p.m. ET.  K.C. might have the better quarterback, but the Eagles require less of  Underdogs have won six of the last 10 Super Bowls  
Jalen Hurts has a chance to do something only Nick Foles has ever done before: quarterback the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl victory. Standing in the way, just like in 2017, is an AFC dynasty. 
Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes: +105 (Bet $100 to win $105) Eagles RB Saquon Barkley: +240 (Bet $100 to net $240)  Chiefs' MVP pick for 2025 Super Bowl: QB Patrick Mahomes (+105) 
This year's Super Bowl is another rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. The last time the two teams faced off at the Super Bowl was in 2023. At the time, majority of  
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
With a win, Hurts would be the third QB to win a College Championship and a Super Bowl as a starter. He would join Joe Namath and Joe Montana as the only players to accomplish the feat. If Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley combine for 27 yards in the Super Bowl, they will break the record for most rushing yards in a season by 2 players on the same  
The Philadelphia Eagles are in the Super Bowl for the second time in the last three seasons. Plenty of familiar faces remain from the Super Bowl 57 roster, but a few notable additions may give the

The Eagles last made the Super Bowl just two seasons ago against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 57. During that season, Jalen Hurts first emerged as an MVP candidate. His partnership with head coach Nick Sirianni immediately led to outstanding results for the team, which ran through the NFC with an unreal average margin of victory (27.5  
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Carson Wentz once again will mostly be a spectator on the sidelines during a Super Bowl appearance by the Philadelphia Eagles.. Seven years after he watched his backup Nick Foles win the MVP after delivering the Eagles their first Super Bowl title, Wentz is back on the big stage as a backup to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes as the Chiefs prepare to take on his former team  </p>
