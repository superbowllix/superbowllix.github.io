        <p>A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines. 
But in this scenario, "He" is the center of a marketing campaign that has spread far across the U.S., spanning between billboards, banner ads online, and a forthcoming Super Bowl commercial. 
The “He Gets Us” ad campaign for Jesus, created by a Dallas advertising firm, will air a Super Bowl ad for the third consecutive year this weekend.Dallas-based  
In between star-studded advertisements and a whole lot of football, this year’s Super Bowl watchers are being taken to church. “He Gets Us,” a campaign to promote Jesus and Christianity, is  
A group called He Gets Us ran two ads during the Super Bowl game on Sunday to spread the word about Jesus. One of the donors behind the ads is a craft chain billionaire worth nearly $15 billion. 
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Who Is My Neighbor,” the 15-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” 
More than just Super Bowl commercials, the He Gets Us campaign first surfaced in March 2022 and has been causing waves through TV spots, billboards, and digital ads. 
The two Super Bowl ads that have become a talking point directed viewers to visit the website to learn more about Jesus, find Bible reading plans and connect with people online or in person who

He Gets Us also aired an ad at last year's Super Bowl, where it was funded by the Kansas-based charity the Servant Foundation, which itself is a financial backer of Alliance Defending Freedom. ADF  
A Christian commercial about Jesus that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday angered some conservatives who felt like the advertisement justified certain sins. 
Most Super Bowl adverts plug things like fizzy drink and cars, but one of the most talked-about commercials the day after the big game was selling Jesus - and it upset several very different  
The 2024 Super Bowl featured a "He Gets Us" commercial. Viewers who caught it may be wondering about the song played during and who the voice behind it was. 
He Gets Us Super Bowl Ad 2024 – A moment of humility in a time of glory: The ‘Foot Washing’ ad by He Gets Us. The “Foot Washing” advert’s placement in the Super Bowl lineup could amplify its message to a vast audience, offering a moment of introspection amid the event’s festivities. 
The Super Bowl will once again feature ads promoting Jesus, thanks in large part to the billionaire family that leads Hobby Lobby.. He Gets Us, the billion-dollar campaign to further raise Jesus  
The fact a Jesus ad was shown during such an event makes me question if that ad is backing true Christianity or a more popularized and progressive form of it. I also would question how a true Christian organization would be able to afford to have an ad showing during the super bowl, but that is more of a secondary point.

On Super Bowl Sunday, an ad campaign is promoting Jesus’ unconditional love to counter the notion that religion is used to divide people By Holly Meyer • Published February 9, 2023 • Updated  
The ad will cost The Signatry $20 million to air in the Super Bowl, and they hope to reach more than 100 million people with their commercial. View this post on Instagram A post shared by He Gets  </p>
