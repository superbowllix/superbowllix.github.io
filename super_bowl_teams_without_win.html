        <h2><strong>super bowl teams without win san diego super bowl halftime show</strong></h2>
        <p>That is even more crazy when you think about how 12 NFL teams have never won even one Super Bowl. Let’s take a look at those 12 teams and see how close they’ve come to getting off this list  
Most Super Bowl appearances without a win. The Vikings and Bills have each appeared four times in the Super Bowl without a victory to their name. The Vikings' most recent appearance came in 1977  
Having been in existence since 1920, the Cardinals are the oldest franchise without a Super Bowl victory, though they did win two league championships (1925, 1947) prior to the Super Bowl era when  
In two appearances, Atlanta fell short in Super Bowl 33 and lost more famously in Super Bowl 51. The New England Patriots would win that game after the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead. 
Cleveland Browns. The Browns won four NFL championships pre-merger (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964), but have never won a Super Bowl. Cleveland’s 1964 championship was the city’s most recent title  
A. 8 teams have Super Bowl appearances without victories. These teams are the Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Carolina Panthers, Atlanta Falcons, Los Angeles Chargers  
What Team Has Lost the Most Super Bowls? The Denver Broncos and New England Patriots have each lost five Super Bowls, the most among all teams. The Buffalo Bills and Minnesota Vikings are tied for the most Super Bowl losses (four) without a win. The Broncos are 3-5 in eight Super Bowl appearances, while the Patriots are 6-5 in 11 appearances. 
Outside of 2023, the last time the Lions won in the playoffs was 1991—when Barry Sanders led the team to a 12–4 record and first-round win before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champs  
Oldest NFL team without a Super Bowl win. No franchise has been held without a Super Bowl win longer than the Cardinals, who have existed in some capacity as an NFL franchise since 1920, picked up  
In the first year that the squad was called the “Tennessee Titans,” the team made it to the Super Bowl in the 1998-1999 season but fell to the Rams 23-16. A last-second Kevin Dyson dive to the end zone to tie the game came up short, and the Titans were left without a Super Bowl victory. 
It’s worth noting that the Browns won four NFL championships (1950, 1954, 1955, and 1964) and so did the Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957) back in the day, but those titles predate the Super Bowl era, which began in 1967. Oldest NFL Team Without A Super Bowl Win. The Cardinals are the oldest NFL team without a Super Bowl win. 
Most Super Bowl Losses Without a Win. For some teams, they haven’t been able to find success when reaching the Super Bowl. The most notable is the Buffalo Bills who lost 4 Super Bowls in a row from 1990-93. Take a look at the teams with the most losses in the Super Bowl without ever winning it all. 
The 12 NFL Teams Without a Super Bowl Win Glory isn’t for anybody. Presented in alphabetical order, here are the teams that have yet to win it all and be crowned NFL champions in the Super Bowl era: 
The Arizona Cardinals are the oldest NFL team without a Super Bowl win. The franchise dates back to 1920 and won a pair of league championships (1925 and 1947) before the Super Bowl era, but they  
The longest currently active Super Bowl drought belongs to the Arizona Cardinals, who have gone 77 seasons without winning the Super Bowl. This drought pre-dates the modern Super Bowl era, so before 1966 the drought also counts seasons since they last won the NFL Championship. 
This list also counts all seasons since a team last won the league championship or Super Bowl. Of active NFL teams, 20 have won the Super Bowl, 7 have not won a Super Bowl, but have won an AFL or NFL championship pre-merger, and 5 have not won any championship or Super Bowl. 
To determine the teams that have gone the longest without winning the Super Bowl, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the results of all 55 Super Bowls using Pro Football Reference. In the Super Bowl era, a dozen  
Having been in existence since 1920, the Cardinals are the oldest franchise without a Super Bowl victory, though they did win two league championships (1925, 1947) prior to the Super Bowl era when  
In 2002, Johnson led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the only Super Bowl championship in franchise history. It was a great year for the former Florida State star, who threw for 22 touchdowns and only
