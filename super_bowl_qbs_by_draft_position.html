Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The quarterback gets plenty of blame when a team loses the Super Bowl. On the other side, the signal-callers get plenty of love when their team wins the NFL championship. Who have been the winning QBs in Super Bowls through the years? And what round of the draft were they chosen? 
Doug Williams played college ball at Grambling State. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 17th overall. Williams played five years with TB, then detouring to the USFL before going to Washington. With his second NFL team, Williams had one of the great Super Bowls in history. Williams threw for 340 yards and four touchdowns in Super Bowl XXII. 
We compiled the Super Bowl era quarterback draft based on draft position and picked the best one at each spot from 1 to 32. A total of 28 of those 32 spots were filled, and there were more than a

The rest of the draft. Unsurprisingly, the majority of starting quarterbacks in the Super Bowl have been found in the first round. In addition to the 13 No. 1 picks, 21 other quarterbacks — 34

Leading up to Super Bowl LIX, Moon discussed the current state of the Titans, his thoughts on the team’s potential options at the quarterback position this offseason, from the NFL Draft to free agency to the team’s returning QBs.

Under Center: Quarterback After a half-dozen QBs were taken among the top 12 of the 2024 NFL Draft, most draft analysts believe the QB class in the 2025 draft is top heavy -- but with some talent likely to be available in later rounds. Cam Ward (Miami) and Shedeur Sanders (Colorado) could come off the board among the top 10 picks.

Number of Games Started: 6 (fewest) I know we said no context, but seriously Giants? You’ve been a franchise since 1925 and in the Super Bowl era you have six games started by a Black quarterback. 
I did this research last week, but only for QBs drafted in the first 15 picks since 2001. There were 40 QBs taken within the first 15 picks. 2014 or 2015 (can't remember) didn't have a QB selected until 22. Out of the 40 QBs, I counted 16 QBs who were or are currently viable (just personal judgment based on quick success). 
The following season, the Steelers would beat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl, and Roethlisberger would claim the title of youngest QB (23) to win a Super Bowl from Brady. Peyton Manning Drafted by
