Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.

T here have been 820 quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era — 34 have won a Super Bowl; and 13 have won more than one Super Bowl. If Patrick Mahomes wins next Sunday, he will join Troy Aikman (3), Terry Bradshaw (4), Joe Montana (4), and Tom Brady (7) as the only quarterbacks to win three or more Super Bowls. 
Bradshaw threw for 300-plus yards in half his Super Bowls which, in the 1970s, was the quarterback equivalent of going to the moon (Super Bowl XII, in 1978, featured 217 total net passing yards).

Retiring as a five-time MVP, Manning held NFL records for most touchdowns (539) and passing yards (71,940), although these records have since been surpassed.
