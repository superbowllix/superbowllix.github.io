        <h2><strong>super bowl jesus ads reddit super bowl what channel is the super bowl game on sunday</strong></h2>
        <p>I think they were the best part of the Super Bowl. It was refreshing like a cup of water to see the name of Jesus exalted at the Super Bowl. For the one who is not against us is for us. For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward. (Mark 9:40‭-‬41 ESV) 
The fact a Jesus ad was shown during such an event makes me question if that ad is backing true Christianity or a more popularized and progressive form of it. I also would question how a true Christian organization would be able to afford to have an ad showing during the super bowl, but that is more of a secondary point. 
These Super Bowl ads are often scrutinized by news media and watchdog type groups. It's one of the reasons we often know how much they paid. I don't think this is just happening to the christian ad. 
The group behind the campaign has also purchased an advertisement slot for this Sunday's Super Bowl, one of the most expensive brand platforms out there. The estimated costs for those ads will run  
It’s becoming a Super Bowl tradition: He Gets Us, the billion-dollar effort to overhaul the public image of Jesus, the Son of God, will be back on the airwaves during Super Bowl LIX. Greg Miller  
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Foot Washing,” the 60-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” 
The creators of the &amp;#8220;Jesus ad&amp;#8221; shown during the Super Bowl last Sunday hope the public debate it has generated will spark an interest in Christianity. 
During Super Bowl LVIII, a new nonprofit group called Come Near released two ads with the tagline “He Gets Us” to promote the Christian faith in a way that it believes is relatable, non  
A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines. 
The ad will explore “how Jesus redefined true greatness.” Lerma, the lead creative agency behind He Gets Us’ previous Super Bowl spots, created the 2025 ad as well. 
The blood of Jesus wasn’t meant to whitewash right wing politics. This faux Christian right wing recruiting and bad faith Christians that are still privileged as people of faith is what is emptying churches of people of conscience. 
John 18:36 “Jesus answered, “My kingdom is no part of this world”” John 17:16 “They are no part of the world just as I (Jesus) am no part of the world.” I like to think of this as Jesus saying to be neutral in politics and to not take sides 
I'm pretty sure at least 1 on those millions is directly targeting ME because I see these stupid fucking ads every three lines in my Reddit feed! The twist: I'm an Atheist (TST, technically) and the chances of me going Jesus are less than zero. 
The NFL gives teams $4,000 for each Super Bowl ring, and team owners spend their own money to improve them. The rings Chicago Bears players received from the McCaskey family for Super Bowl XX cost $4,000.

Super bowl ads cost upwards of $7million US for 30 seconds. This is the first time I see them say it was only 2 ads, because I thought it was 4. 7million x 2 = 14million USD for 1 minute of promoting a tax-exempt 2000 years old cult.

Two "He Gets Us" Jesus ads will air during the Super Bowl. The group behind the ads has given $19 million to the hate group Alliance Defending Freedom and $8 million to Answers in Genesis (Creation Museum, Ark Park). They are anti-science Christian Nationalists who oppose LGBT and women's rights 
I thought the commercials were by and large exceptionally good this year. Beer, chips, soda, Ram, avocados, Amazon even the Jesus commercials were attention getting (then they were spoiled by being commercials for "Jesus") Movie trailers weren't bad. The only one I remember thinking was totally awful was whatever the hell meta was trying do. 
Today is the superbowl and I figure we start a new tradition. Since a lot of people make ads a part of it. Iets roast the worst of the worst. A waste of millions of dollars. Comment your vote. Whatever if it's unfunny, annoying, depressing, preachy whatever! Cast your vote and let's see what is the worst of the Super Bowl! </p>
