        <h2><strong>super bowl wins for dallas cowboys miami dolphins super bowl team roster</strong></h2>
        <p>How many times have the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl? The Dallas Cowboys have won a total of 5 Super Bowls, in 1971, 1977, 1992-1993 and 1995. 
The Dallas Cowboys won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXVII and XXVIII); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl XXIX champion San Francisco 49ers. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three titles in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super  
The Cowboys last won the Super Bowl in the 1995 season. Super Bowl XXX was the last Super Bowl appearance by the Dallas Cowboys too. They won the match by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17  
Dallas Cowboys All-Time Super Bowl Record The Cowboys are one of the winningest teams in NFL history, owning a 5-3 all-time record in the Super Bowl. They've won the title in each of their past three SB appearances, rattling off wins in 1992, 1993 and 1995. 
Another Super Bowl followed six years later before the Cowboys' dominance faded in 1982, and so started a nine-year stretch in which Dallas only reached the post-season twice. But as the 1980s came to an end, life under new owner Jerry Jones was about to begin, and under head coaches Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer, the Cowboys were crowned  
The most prevalent matchup to have occurred in the Super Bowl is Steelers vs. Cowboys, which has been contested on three separate occasions. Pittsburgh currently owns the Super Bowl series, 2-1. Teams 
The last time the Dallas Cowboys won a Super Bowl was in 1996, during Super Bowl XXX, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 27-17. Since then, they have not managed to secure another championship.

While the Cowboys won't be participating, they're tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the most Super Bowls in NFL history with five and captured their second in 1977 in Super Bowl XII in a 27-10 win over the Denver Broncos. 
4. XXVIII 1994: Cowboys 30, Bills 13 – About as ho-hum as a Super Bowl can get, it was another expected blowout over another overmatched Buffalo Bills’ team in the wake of Dallas’ bigger  
The Dallas Cowboys’ Last Super Bowl Victory. Dallas became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years. During the 1995 season, they made history by beating the Steelers 27-17. The Super Bowl came after several key veterans left the team, including wide receiver Alvin Harper and safety James Washington. 
Super Bowl VI (1971 season) - Dallas Cowboys 24, Miami Dolphins 3. The Cowboys' first Super Bowl win was Super Bowl VI which was played on January 16, 1972 at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans. Quarterback Roger Staubach was named Super Bowl MVP in his first season as starter for the Cowboys. 
Sunday's LVIII will be the 28th consecutive Super Bowl without the Cowboys. Only nine teams have longer droughts, and three of those - Jaguars (29), Browns (55) and Lions (58) - have never been to

The Cowboys have not made the Super Bowl since the 1995 season when they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers to bring home the Lombardi Trophy. At the time of their fifth Super Bowl win in 1995, the Cowboys were tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the most Super Bowl titles in the NFL. However, Dallas has since been surpassed by teams below them

In the twenty-seventh Super Bowl, which was held at Rose Bowl Stadium California, the Dallas Cowboys made their most historically satisfying win against the AFC champions Buffalo Bills. Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, James Washington, etc all played their part most wonderfully to earn our American team their most amazing win of 52 to 17. 
But the Dallas faithful’s disappointment isn’t without warrant considering the last time the Cowboys won the big game was 1995. Let’s reflect back on each of Dallas’ five wins: 1971 – Super Bowl VI: Cowboys 24 – Dolphins 3. The first Super Bowl in Cowboys franchise history was dominant. </p>
