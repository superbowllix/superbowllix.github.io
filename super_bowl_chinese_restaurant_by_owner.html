        <h2><strong>super bowl chinese restaurant by owner super bowl xli ball</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl Chinese restaurant is one of many Chinese restaurants on restaurant row. Plenty of seating as they have two sides of the restaurant. Good noodles, rice, rice porridge (jok) and appetizers. For Sydney standards, the Chinese food is good. You can't compare it to Los Angeles, Bangkok or Hong Kong Chinese restaurants though.

The absolute worst restaurant I ever been to possibly in my entire life. I’d rate this place zero stars if I could. The cutlery and dishes were dirty; the Food was bland; part of our order was missing; the coconut was frozen and old; the place had flies everywhere ; the waiters didn’t bother with us for not being Chinese; they gave us the stink eye and the walked away after being called.

Amazing and delicious food with excellent service. We had 7 people and ordered a set B and set E and it was good value $20pp. The fried glutinous rice dish was very flavourful and the seafood in the Sweet Corn fried fish and boiled squid was impeccable. 
Food was nice, however this would definitely be near the bottom of my list for Chinese restaurants for food. Atmosphere was alright. Dark, away from traffic, and medium sized. They do have buttons for service/order/cheque though which is cool.
