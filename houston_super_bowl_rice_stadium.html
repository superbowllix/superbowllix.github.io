        <h2><strong>houston super bowl rice stadium michael jackson super bowl full performance</strong></h2>
        <p>Rice Stadium is an American football stadium located on the Rice University campus in Houston, Texas.It has been the home of the Rice Owls football team since its completion in 1950, [6] and hosted John F. Kennedy's "We choose to go to the Moon" speech in 1962 and Super Bowl VIII in early 1974. 
The celebration didn't last long, though, because Houston had less than two years to prepare for Super Bowl VIII, which would be played on Jan. 13, 1974, at Rice Stadium. 
This was also the first Super Bowl played in a stadium that was not the current home to an NFL or AFL team, as no team had called Rice Stadium home since the Houston Oilers moved into the Astrodome in 1968. At that time, the Astrodome seated just over 50,000 for football, and was considered too small to host the Super Bowl. 
Ushers wade through a sea of trash after Rice Stadium hosted Super Bowl VIII in 1974. It cost an estimated $25,000 to clean up the stadium and parking lot after the game. 
On a foggy, damp day in Houston on Jan. 13, 1974, just under 72,000 people packed into Rice Stadium to watch the Miami Dolphins take on the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII. Rice was no stranger to hosting professional football games, having hosted the Houston Oilers for three seasons that included their largest crowds until the “Luv Ya  
Opened in 1950, the stadium has hosted numerous memorable events and games, including Rice Owls – Rice Stadium games, the 1962 John F. Kennedy Speech, and Super Bowl VIII in 1974. The stadium provides excellent viewing experiences for all attendees, ensuring an enjoyable time for fans supporting the Rice University Owls. 
A lot has changed since Houston hosted its first Super Bowl -- Super Bowl VIII -- in 1974. More than 71,000 fans gathered at Rice University Stadium to watch the Miami Dolphins play the Minnesota  
In the 1990’s Rice Stadium saw several improvements, in 1995 new lights, in 1996, new scoreboards and in 1997 new Astroturf. Other than being the home of the Rice Owls, the stadium was home of the Houston Oilers before they moved in the Houston Astrodome. It was also the site of Super Bowl VIII. 
At various times, the stadium has served as the home stadium for the Bluebonnet Bowl, the University of Houston, Texas Southern University and the NFL's Houston Oilers. On Jan. 13, 1974, Rice Stadium was the site of Super Bowl VIII, in which the Miami Dolphins defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24-7. Rice Stadium is one of only three campus

In honor of the Super Bowl being played in Houston this year I’m going to take a look at what happened there over 40 years ago. On January 12, 1974, to be specific–in Super Bowl VIII. The game was played at Rice Stadium where the Rice University Owls play. Up until that time the Super Bowl had always been played in LA, Miami, or New Orleans. 
In the 1990’s Rice Stadium saw several improvements, in 1995 new lights, in 1996, new scoreboards and in 1997 new Astroturf. Other than being the home of the Rice Owls, the stadium was home of the Houston Oilers before they moved in the Houston Astrodome. It was also the site of Super Bowl VIII. 
No one on Atlanta's roster is old enough to remember Houston's first Super Bowl in 1974. But while 43 years have passed since Super Bowl VIII at Rice Stadium, its far-reaching effects can still be  
Since 1950, historic Rice Stadium has been the home field for the Owls. Built right on campus, the venerable venue has been the home of Rice football and the Houston Cougars, the NFL’s Houston Oilers, and was the site of the Bluebonnet Bowl from 1959-1967 and again from 1985-1986. 
Rice Stadium is an American football stadium located on the Rice University campus in Houston, Texas. It has been the home of the Rice Owls football team since its completion in 1950, and hosted Super Bowl VIII in early 1974. Architecturally, Rice Stadium is an example of modern architecture, with simple lines and an unadorned, functional design. The lower seating bowl is located below the surr 
Rice Stadium replaced Rice Field (now Wendel D. Ley Track and Holloway Field), which had a total capacity of less than 37,000, in 1950. [9] The new stadium was subsidized by the City of Houston, and it was designed by Hermon Lloyd &amp; W. B. Morgan and Milton McGinty and built by Brown and Root.
