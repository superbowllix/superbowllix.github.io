The 49ers, Broncos and New England Patriots are the only teams so far to play two or more Super Bowls at the Superdome. The 49ers also joined the Broncos  
The NFL has hosted seven Super Bowls at the Superdome, most recently Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. The Superdome is scheduled to host Super Bowl LIX in 2025. The 1976 Pro Bowl was held at the Superdome on Monday, January 26, 1976. It was the NFL's 26th annual all-star game. [55]

Super Bowl XLVII (meaning Super Bowl 47 in Roman numerals) was a Super Bowl game in which the Baltimore Ravens, winners of the American Football Conference (AFC) for the 2012 season, beat the San Francisco 49ers, winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) for the 2012 season, 34–31 to become winners of National Football League (NFL) for the 2012 season. 
Video boards also have been updated and enlarged since the last Super Bowl. “The original design to me is quite remarkable for many reasons,” Thornton said. “One, the sheer volume of building has allowed us to do all this work. This stadium is the same size today as modern stadiums. But it was designed more than 50 years ago.”

Super Bowl XLVII was a thriller between the 49ers and Ravens, but it will forever be remembered for the power outage inside the Superdome.  The stadium operations people began shutting down the  
The stadium opened in August 1975, too late to host Super Bowl IX, which the N.F.L. moved to Tulane. The cost quadrupled to $163 million and included Mardi Grass, an artificial turf. 
When Super Bowl XLVII kicks off in New Orleans on Sunday, it will be the culmination of the remarkable recovery of a resilient city.  An enormous stadium in the heart of the city, it is the

The 49ers failed to get that sixth Super Bowl win that would have tied them with the Steelers for the most Super Bowls ever; they’d get another chance seven years later. Next time, we will have one of the weirdest routs in Super Bowl history, a game that brought the NFL back to the eighties, with the NFC dominating the AFC in brutal fashion.

Super Bowl XLVIII was the first Super Bowl held at an open-air stadium in a "cold-weather" city; previous Super Bowls in cold-weather cities were held at indoor stadiums. However, the temperature at kickoff was a mild 49°F / 9°C, making this only the third-coldest Super Bowl. A major snow storm hit the area the very next day. 
Things took an unexpected turn after halftime when stadium lights went out during Super Bowl XLVII.There was a slight delay in game action, but some memorable images were created while the bright  
Super Bowl XXX was held on Jan. 28, 1996, at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe. The Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17.
