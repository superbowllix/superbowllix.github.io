        <p>Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles.

Hurts turned in an elite Super Bowl debut to close 2022, scoring four total touchdowns in a 38-35 defeat to Mahomes' Chiefs, but he also lost a fumble in that one. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
The Philadelphia Eagles entered Super Bowl LII as a 5.5-point underdog to the defending champions; the New England Patriots. This was also their first appearance in 13 years, with their last Super Bowl berth happening in 2005 (Super Bowl XXXIX), also against the New England Patriots. 
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles (9) holds his daughter, Lily James, after winning the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game against the New England Patriots, Sunday, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis. 
Thanks to a masterful performance from quarterback Jalen Hurts, the Philadelphia Eagles are heading back to the Super Bowl. The Eagles, who finished the regular season with a 14-3 record, will be  
Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles stood blow-for-blow with the greatest quarterback ever to stalk the gridiron, as the two teams combined for 1,151 yards -- shattering the record for most in any NFL game. 
Super Bowl LII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2017 season.As a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX from 13 years earlier, the game was between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles and the American Football Conference (AFC) and defending Super Bowl LI champion New England Patriots. 
How Many Super Bowls Have the Eagles Played In? Super Bowl 15 — January 1981; Super Bowl 39 — February 2005; Super Bowl 52 — February 2018; Super Bowl 57 — February 2023; Although the Eagles have appeared in four Super Bowls, they also made several championship appearances in the pre-Super Bowl era. 
The Philadelphia Eagles are a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night in New Orleans away from winning the franchise’s second Super Bowl following a 55-23 thrashing of the Washington  
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The Eagles have a five-point lead on New England, 2 minutes and 21 seconds remaining in Super Bowl LII. On the field comes Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who to this point has thrown for TK yards of the Patriots' 570 total net yards. 
Two years ago, he led the Eagles into Super Bowl LVII against the Kansas City Chiefs, and came up a field goal short. He was asked in a press conference Thursday what he hopes is different this time around as the Eagles face the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. “I’d like to win the game,” he said simply. 
Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title.

The Philadelphia Eagles have aspirations of reaching their second Super Bowl in three seasons with a win this Sunday when they host the Washington Commanders. But without a healthy Jalen Hurts  
The Eagles reached the NFC championship game three consecutive times (2001-03) and lost all three before finally breaking through and then losing to the Patriots in Super Bowl 39. 
The Philadelphia Eagles made it to Super Bowl 59 with ease after routing the Washington Commanders 55-23 in the 2025 NFC championship game. Now, Philadelphia will turn its attention to the Kansas  </p>
