        <p>The Eagles entered Super Bowl LII as 5.5-point underdogs to the Patriots, who were attempting to go back-to-back as champions. But that didn’t seem to phase Philadelphia. 
Won Super Bowl 41-33 vs. New England Patriots. Offensive Coordinator: Frank Reich. Defensive Coordinator: Jim Schwartz. Other Notable Asst.: John DeFilippo (Quarterbacks), Ken Flajole (Linebackers), Mike Groh (Wide Receivers), Press Taylor (Off. Quality Control/Asst. Quarterbacks) and Cory Undlin (Defensive Backs) Stadium: Lincoln Financial Field 
With this win, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl and their first NFL title since 1960. [9] Both teams managed to set an all-time NFL record for total combined yards in a game (1,151), and the 74 game points were one short of the Super Bowl record set in 1995 . 
The Eagles have relied on Barkley's running ability in their run to Super Bowl LIX. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images “I think Saquon Barkley is the best running back to ever play this game,” he  
Philadelphia also won three NFL championships before the first Super Bowl in 1967: back-to-back titles in 1948 and 1949 as well as a 1960 title. FLY, EAGLES, FLY: Lyrics and history behind the

The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have won one Super Bowl in franchise history. The Eagles were champions of the 2017 NFL season after beating the Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. Before the Super Bowl era, the Eagles won three NFL Championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960. 
While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
But the Eagles are the better team in almost every area — especially at running back, where Barkley will run for 175 yards and two long touchdowns to win MVP in the Eagles’ win. 
Eagles History: Victory song transformed into “Fly Eagles Fly” in the late 1990s; Eagles fans in California have found a new way to wager on Super Bowl LIX; Eagles Injury Report: Brandon Graham, A.J. Brown give encouraging updates ahead of Super Bowl LIX; Eagles QB Jalen Hurts is making and chasing Super Bowl history at 26 years old

Eagles. Miles Sanders: With 1,269 rushing yards (and 11 touchdowns) in 2022, the four-year veteran is Philadelphia’s biggest running threat; he’s the only running back with more than 250  
The Philadelphia Eagles are loaded on both sides of the ball, but for Mark Ingram II, Saquon Barkley is the main reason why they are back in the Super Bowl. 
A running back rarely can carry a team to a championship. But when one does, it is one of the more remarkable feats in football. Seven running backs have won Super Bowl MVP, but none since Terrell Davis in the 1997 season. 
Davis had become the first 2,000-yard rusher to make the Super Bowl, something that was not repeated until Barkley’s exploits this season, with the Eagles running back closing in on Davis’ combined regular season and playoff rushing record. 
The Eagles ran it well too. They were second in the NFL to the Baltimore Ravens in rushing yards and fifth in rushing yards per attempt. Barkley is likely to win NFL Offensive Player of the Year  
Saquon Barkley has enjoyed a historic season and has helped lead the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl.  given Adrian Peterson was the last running back to win the award 13 years ago.
