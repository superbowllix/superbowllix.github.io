        <p>Doug Pederson served five seasons with the Eagles as their head coach before being fired on January 11, 2021, after leading the team to a 4–11–1 record in his final year as head coach. Nick Sirianni has been head coach since January 24, 2021. 
The Eagles have appeared in four Super Bowls overall, winning only Super Bowl 52. Two of their four appearances came against the Patriots. They will make their fifth appearance to conclude 
The Eagles won Super Bowl 52 against the Patriots in 2018. Quarterback Nick Foles won the Super Bowl MVP that year after throwing three touchdown passes and catching one himself in the iconic  
The following NFL head coaches have coached in two or more Super Bowls. Of eligible coaches not in the Hall of Fame, only two have had three or more appearances: Mike Holmgren and Dan Reeves. There are only two eligible coaches with multiple wins to not be inducted into the Hall of Fame: George Seifert and Mike Shanahan. 
Andy Reid had a long history with the Eagles, but he couldn't win the big game while coaching in Philadelphia. 
In the playoffs, Sirianni led the Eagles to their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history after a 38–7 Divisional Round playoff victory over the New York Giants and a 31–7 NFC Championship victory over the San Francisco 49ers. 
With head coach Greasy Neale and running back Steve Van Buren leading the way, the Eagles won the title in the latter two seasons. After losing to the Chicago Cardinals in 1947, Philadelphia defeated the Cardinals in 1948 and the Los Angeles Rams in 1949. 
The Eagles look to win their second Super Bowl in franchise history,  Fun fact: Andy Reid is the winningest head coach in the history of both franchises. Reid went 130-93-1 (10-9 in the  
There was the overlooked quarterback, the underestimated head coach, and the demoted general manager, all of whom banded together to form the foundation of Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl-winning team. The 2017-18 Eagles embodied the spirit and the persona and the bite of their hometown. A team of  
In Nick Sirriani’s second year as the team’s head coach, the Eagles made it to the Super Bowl following the 2022 season, and were listed as 1-point favorites to defeat Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. 
Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, Nelson Agholor, Zach Ertz, Trey Burton, Brent Celek, Jay Ajayi, LeGarrette Blount, and Corey Clement all had critical roles as skill-position players in the win. No Eagles player accumulated more than 1,000 yards this year, making it the first team to win the Super Bowl with that stat since the New York Giants in  
Pederson – who would go onto win the Eagles’ first ever Super Bowl title as head coach in 2018 – remembers how organized Reid was and how it impacted his own coaching style. 
Teams that score first in the Super Bowl have won the game 64% of the time.  Reid is 4-1 ATS (80%) and 3-2 SU (60%) as a head coach in the Super Bowl (Chiefs and Eagles). Reid is 4-1 ATS and SU  
The Philadelphia Eagles have won one Super Bowl in franchise history. The Eagles were champions of the 2017 NFL season after beating the Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. Before the Super Bowl era, the Eagles won three NFL Championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960. 
He’s the third head coach to reach the Super Bowl twice in his first four seasons, joining Hall of Famer Joe Gibbs (1982-83) and Mike Tomlin (2008, 2010). Sirianni is 48-20 in the regular season. 
His most successful season with the Eagles was in 2017 when he won Super Bowl LII, the franchise's first Super Bowl title. [1] Pederson became the head coach of the Jaguars in 2022, and in his first season there he led them to their first division title and first playoff victory since 2017. 
Nick Sirianni has been the NFC's most successful coach since the Philadelphia Eagles hired him in 2021. He's now led the team to two Super Bowls and a second NFC championship after Sunday's 55-23  
This was the second time the Eagles and Patriots battled in a Super Bowl; when they met in Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots won 24–21. Backup quarterback Nick Foles was named Super Bowl MVP . 
LAWRENCE — The Kansas City Chiefs are within reach of a third-straight Super Bowl. While there have been challengers during the current NFL season, the Chiefs have remained the team to beat  
The Super Bowl's 59 greatest players:Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce make cut, but so do 2 Eagles With a win, the Chiefs would become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive Super Bowls. </p>
