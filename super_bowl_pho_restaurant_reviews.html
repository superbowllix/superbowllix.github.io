Super bowl indeed. Parking is available in the nice large strip mall lot. The place looks like it used to be a Korean restaurant at some point, with the wood panelling. Actually it used to be Japanese. Staff were friendly. No problems. I wasn't sure what to try so I had their house special which contains all the various cow parts.

The service people were nice and friendly. We ordered pho tai and rice dishes this time around, I'll give a quick general review of the pho then the individual items. Pho Tai - I personally think the pho was fine. It was a standard pho, what you would expect out of a pho place, though my wife wasn't a huge fan.

We had dinner at Pho SuperBowl &amp; Tea Station while staying in SD. The restaurant is clean, bright and spacious. The service was nice, but the only drawback was that the food took forever to come out which is not ideal with young kids. +Thai tea was $6 (a little steep for a restaurant IMO). It was just ok. 
We had the Vietnamese spring roll (goi cuon) but they were mediocre though. They put too much veggies inside and we could not taste the meat. And I wish the beef could be medium well but they were all well done. The pho (soup noodles) was tasty. Service was okay and price was very reasonable. I'm craving for a hot bowl of pho now.

Super Bowl Pho in Westfield rated 4 out of 5 on Restaurant Guru: 325 reviews by visitors, 87 photos. Explore menu, check opening hours 
The restaurant is often crowded and you may have to wait 5 min for a table. But it gives me confidence that the restaurant is delicious. I think the Pho is quite tasty here. I worry a bit when the Pho at I Heart Pho comes out lightning quick. The speed is fine at Super Bowl, and makes me think they put a tad more effort into making it. 
Looks like the Pho Boi here has died and reincarnated into Pho Super Bowl. This would be the 2nd location (the original location is by Burquitlam station). Parking is available on the side streets, as well as in a parkade beneath the restaurant. The place has been somewhat renovated. The interior is a bit too bright. </p>
