        <h2><strong>detroit lions super bowl reddit super bowl under and over</strong></h2>
        <p>A friend of mine and I joked about what would happen if the Lions won the Superbowl. Would it be a Sign of the End of Days!? We imagined the 4 Horsemen descending as the Lions ran for a game winning touchdown. My friend died last year, so he's not seeing the glory of the Lions. I made this for his memory, I hope you like it. 
One red wings parade had like 1.2 million people show up. Id bet you’d have 3-4 times that many people (essentially half the state) trying to descend on Detroit for a Super Bowl parade and rally. ETA: I live 10 mi from Ford Field. If we had a Super Bowl parade, I’d legit probably ride my bike downtown to get there. 
Vegas odds imply a 1.5% chance of DET vs. HOU Super Bowl, based on the combined odds of Lions winning the NFC and Texans winning the AFC. It's super unlikely (as is any individual matchup). 
They didn't defer the kickoff nor kick the field goal on 4th down. They were scare of the Lions! Meanwhile, I don't think the Lions took the Ravens seriously, cause their receivers were wide open. Meanwhile, Lamar had 10 seconds in the box. These type of games don't really matter and I ain't worry. Lions can still win the SB this year!!!!! 
The Lions' achievement revitalized the city, providing a beacon of hope and inspiration to its residents, while cementing their place in the annals of Detroit's storied sporting history. Conclusion: The Detroit Lions' remarkable journey to winning the Super Bowl in 2024 serves as a testament to the power of determination, teamwork, and resilience. 
If the Super Bowl's AFC QB is Lamar, Burrow, AR, or maybe Stroud, I don't think the Lions have a great shot to win it. Mahomes funnily enough is on the list of QBs the Lions can scheme to win against (Alongside Lawrence &amp; Herbert). Before kickoff I got a little excited that the Ravens were tanking.

In just a few days, the 59th Super Bowl will take place, and for the 59th consecutive time, it will not feature the Detroit Lions. This year, it felt like the Lions may finally break the streak  
The Detroit Lions fell short of their lofty Super Bowl-or-bust expectations in 2024. In case you've been living under a rock, they suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Washington  
Through the first four weeks, the Detroit Lions aren’t a perfect team. In the first part of a new series, here are 5 reasons they could fall short of the Super Bowl. 
There's nothing to watch for, I hate the niners, I hate the chiefs. I don't care about good football unless it's in detroit. I'm like that with all sports I guess. It just really sucks we were so close and we threw it all away. Also Josh reynolds did that dropping stuff in the Super Bowl with the rams too, i guess his nerves get to him. 
Unfortunately Campbell would tear his MCL in training camp and never played a game for the Saints. In an even more unfortunate part of the story for Campbell, the Saints would go on to win the Super Bowl that year and because Campbell did not play a game that year, he is not acknowledged as a Super Bowl champion and was not issued a ring.

Realistically the Lions have a better chance to make it to the super bowl than most of the league (based on likely winning the division.) I checked with my team rep about tickets to the superbowl, she said that is handled by the league and LLM’s will not be guaranteed a chance at tickets.

For our non-American Whovians - the Detroit Lions are one of only four American Football teams to never go to the Super Bowl. Even though, the team has been in existence since 1929, it's last championship was in 1957, prior to the start of the Super Bowl Era which started in 1967. 
I say all of that to say this: the Lions are, in my opinion, one of the top 3 teams in the league. The defense is elite. The offense is elite and getting better every week. Your coaching staff is second to none. Enjoy this, Lions fans. You deserve this feeling. The lions are a truly great team, and will absolutely be competing for a #1 seed

People view the Super Bowl as once in a lifetime because of the cost. If the lions made it the next five years I’d probably Attend one. Resale sites didn’t want the patriots in the Super Bowl for this reason. Everyone willing to have the once in a lifetime experience had done it already. And that lead to cheaper tickets.
