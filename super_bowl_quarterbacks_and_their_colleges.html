        <h2><strong>super bowl quarterbacks and their colleges will super bowl ads be on paramount plus</strong></h2>
        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Super Bowl titles: 2 Finishing his career with a long list of NFL records, the former Vols star picked up two Super Bowl championships, first in XLI after the 2006 season with the Colts and  
How many Super Bowl winning starting quarterbacks has your school produced? How many wins can they each brag about? That's going to mean something different in the near future with all the transfers and movements in the college game - Wisconsin gets credit for Russell Wilson, not NC State, and of course UCLA can claim Troy Aikman, not Oklahoma - but it's all fairly obvious. 
Patrick Mahomes (left) and Jalen Hurts during their college days at Texas Tech and Oklahoma, respectively.  The Cal Golden Bears have produced five Super Bowl-starting quarterbacks — the most  
18 other colleges had one alumnus who started a Super Bowl game at quarterback. Category II: Most Super Bowl games started by a quarterback who was an alumnus of a given school. Michigan – 10  
INSIDER set out to determine which colleges produce the most Super Bowl starting quarterbacks and how many Super Bowl victories they have produced. The California Golden Bears lead the pack with a whopping five quarterbacks heading to the Super Bowl after their time in Berkeley came to a close, but the Alabama Crimson Tide and Purdue  
Despite their recent collegiate prowess, the Alabama Crimson Tide hasn't had a Super Bowl-winning QB since 1977. Recent 'Bama quarterbacks drafted into the NFL have fallen short of ultimate glory  
However, worth noting that there's no guaranteed route to making it to the Super Bowl, regardless of where you go to college. It takes a combination of talent, hard work, the right opportunities, and a bit of luck. Regardless of where you go, make sure to choose a college that fits your academic, athletic, and personal needs the best. 
The Kansas City Chiefs became the first back-to-back Super Bowl champions since the 2003-04 New England Patriots. Patrick Mahomes can now boast three Super Bowl rings as his own. 
There are five schools whose quarterbacks have gone on to earn their former schools two Super Bowl victories: BYU, Navy, Miami Ohio, Ole Miss, and Tennessee all lay claim to two NFL Championships. 
The countdown to Super Bowl LIX is on, and while the focus is on the game between Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts, their academic backgrounds have also sparked curiosity. Both quarterbacks have  
It is no secret that being the ultimate team game or not, the quarterback will generally unduly endure the brunt of the blame for a Super Bowl loss but oftentimes bask in the glory of winning the Super Bowl ring. Here is a complete list of the starting QBs that took center stage after their team won in the first 58 editions of the Super Bowl. 
2. Stanford University. They make athletes smarter at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, evidently. Two victorious alumni of the Stanford Cardinal have three Super Bowl rings between them: Former Denver Broncos star John Elway has two (Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII in 1997 and 1998, respectively), while Jim Plunkett also won two as the quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams in 1981 in  
Quarterback. Teams. Number of Super Bowl Titles. Super Bowls Won. MVPs. Tom Brady. New England Patriots, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 7. XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI  
Super Bowl MVPs have come from colleges big and small, from the Division II ranks to powerhouses like Alabama. Here's a rundown of where each Super Bowl MVP played their college football. 
Conversely, had Ford taken the Packers up on their offer, he almost surely would have won multiple NFL championships, as they won several times during the years he would have played, and he'd been a star lineman at Michigan so it's hard to imagine him dragging them down. Not a Super Bowl per se, but the nearest thing. 
Former Boston College Eagles quarterback Matt Ryan didn't just appear on a Super Bowl roster; he led the Atlanta Falcons to 2017's Super Bowl LI. SLIDE 19 of 50 32 (TIE). 
Notre Dame Athletics[/credit] Two colleges stands above all in terms of producing Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks — Notre Dame and Michigan. The Fighting Irish owned the 1980s as Joe Montana and  
Sure, it's really interesting to track where Super Bowl winning athletes got their start in college football. Unfortunately, there's no definitive list, and information can change yearly as Super Bowl results differ. However, there are few colleges that have notable records of sending players to the NFL who have won Super Bowls.
