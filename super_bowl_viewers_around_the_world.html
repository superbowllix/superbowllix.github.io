        <p>NFL Game Pass on DAZN: Viewership across Super Bowl LVIII week increased 61% year-on-year.  bringing together fans in every time zone around the world for a football and cultural spectacle. The  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people.

The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Overall, the Super Bowl was carried live in 190 different countries or territories and broadcast in over 25 languages. “Global interest in the NFL continues to accelerate, and these numbers reflect the exciting growth in our sport around the world,” Peter O’Reilly, NFL Executive Vice President, Club Business, Major Events &amp; International, said in the release. 
There's a reason it costs $7 million for an advertiser to have 30 seconds of screen time during the Super Bowl. In the United States, the NFL is king.
