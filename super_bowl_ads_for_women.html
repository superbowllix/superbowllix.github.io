        <h2><strong>super bowl ads for women super bowl appearances by year since 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>The trend is a “shift from the last few years” when the Super Bowl was “flooded with ads that typically target young men and their vices, like sports betting and crypto investing.” Novartis will mark its Super Bowl debut with a 60-second, “star-studded commercial spotlighting breast cancer awareness.” 
This year Novartis has tapped comedian Wanda Sykes for its first-ever Super Bowl ad to push women to get screened for breast cancer. Coffee mate has tapped Shania Twain for its game day debut. Uber Eats has paired Charli XCX with Martha Stewart for some brat messaging. Hellmann’s is reviving When Harry Met Sally. The [] 
Why it matters: The trend is a shift from the last few years when the Super Bowl was flooded with ads that typically target young men and their vices, like sports betting and crypto investing. Zoom in: Novartis will mark its Super Bowl debut with a 60-second, star-studded commercial spotlighting breast cancer awareness. 
Keller: Super Bowl ads will target women more than ever in 2025 03:05. The opinions expressed below are Jon Keller's, not those of WBZ, CBS News or Paramount Global. 
For e.l.f., the 2024 Super Bowl spot will mark their first national Super Bowl ad, while Dove is returning to the advertising line-up for the first time in nearly two decades. This change in  
Hailee Steinfeld and Wanda Sykes are partnering with Novartis to encourage women to understand their breast cancer risk and get early screenings in a new ad that will air during the Super Bowl on  
Women watch the Super Bowl, too, right? And this year a slew of advertisers is expecting it. Health and beauty companies, some for the first time, are joining the scrum of beverage, technology and  
This year's Super Bowl ads featured women front and center. Getty Images. I have been writing about women as NFL fans for years. This year’s crop of Super Bowl ads felt like a giant leap forward  
There's no denying Super Bowl commercials are as big of a deal as the Halftime Show and the game itself. And this year the big-budget ads are featuring and targeting women more than previous years. 
The conventional wisdom for decades has been that the huge Super Bowl audience is overwhelmingly male, and so men were by default the demographic targeted in ads. Women were generally an afterthought. But this year, a large percentage of the ads are aimed at women, and there seem to be more women present as celebrity product pushers, too.

WeatherTech has released a high-energy tease for its upcoming Super Bowl 2025 commercial, spotlighting four fun-loving women cruising around in a 1963 Lincoln Continental convertible—proving that good times (and top-tier automotive protection) aren’t limited by age. Produced by long-time agency partner Pinnacle Advertising, the “Born to

Some other firsts can be seen across the emerging commercial topics. For one thing, more spots will cater to women. Viewers can also expect a bigger presence from artificial intelligence and pharmaceutical brands, but fewer movie trailers, with a preference toward the longer, 60-second commercials, as Fox Sports’ Head of Sales Mark Evans told Ad Age. 
In last year’s Super Bowl LI, more than 2.5 as many leading ad roles went to men than to women, 61 for men compared with 23 for women, according to the Ad Age Super Bowl Archive, which excludes movie trailers and TV promos.
