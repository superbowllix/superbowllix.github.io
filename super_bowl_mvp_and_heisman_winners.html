        <p>The fourth and the most recent Heisman winner to win the Super Bowl MVP is Desmond Howard who won the Heisman as a wide receiver for the Michigan Wolverines in 1991 but made his impact for the  
Pro Bowl History; AP MVP; AP AFL Player of the Year; UPI MVP; UPI AFL Player of the Year; PFWA MVP; Newspaper Ent. Assoc. MVP; Sporting News Player of the Year; Joe F. Carr Trophy (MVP) Bert Bell Award (Player of the Year) AAFC MVP; Super Bowl MVP; Walter Payton Man of the Year; NFLPA Alan Page Community Award; AP Offensive Player of the Year  
Heisman winners who also were named Super Bowl MVP is trimmed down to four with Staubach (1972), Plunkett (81), Allen (84) and Howard (97) pulling off the rare feat.  2016 was the last time a  
Allen easily has claim to the greatest Super Bowl performance from a Heisman. The former USC Trojan popped off for 191 rushing yards and two touchdowns on just 20 carries to win MVP honors. Allen remains the only player in NFL history to have won the Heisman, a national title, NFL MVP, a Super Bowl and Super Bowl MVP. Redskins RB George Rogers  
Eli Manning’s Super Bowl XLII Most Valuable Player Award combined with Peyton Manning’s SB XLI MVP trophy marked the first time that brothers were named Super Bowl MVPs. Desmond Howard is the only Heisman Trophy winner to earned a Super Bowl MVP award. Only Terry Bradshaw Joe Montana and Patrick Mahomes have won consecutive Super Bowl MVP

An MVP has been honored for every Super Bowl, but the trophy, which is named after longtime NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, was first given out at Super Bowl 25.And one player in this year’s Big  
The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's  
He became the fourth Heisman winner to win Super Bowl MVP honors. Super Bowl XXXIV, 2000 – Eddie George (Tennessee) George rushed for 95 yards and two touchdowns on 28 carries (with a long of 13), and caught 2 passes for 35 yards. Super Bowl XXXV, 2001 – Ron Dayne (New York Giants) Dayne appeared in the game, but did not carry the ball. 
A Heisman winner would not win another Super Bowl MVP award until Desmond Howard did so while playing for the Packers in the 1997 Super Bowl. Howard was the first special teams player to win MVP honors after totaling 244 return yards (including a 99-yard kickoff return touchdown) as Green Bay downed New England, 35-21. 
Most passing yards by a Heisman winner in a Super Bowl. 265 – Cam Newton, 2016. Most TD passes by a Heisman winner in a Super Bowl. 3 – Jim Plunkett (1981), Roger Staubach (1979) Most TDs scored by a Heisman winner in a Super Bowl. 2 – Marcus Allen (1984), Eddie George (2000) Most receptions by a Heisman winner in a Super Bowl. 7  
Seventeen Heisman trophy winners have played in the Super Bowl, but only four were ever named Super Bowl MVP. The Heisman recognizes the best player in college football, so it is a bit surprising  
Heisman-winning season: 1999 College: Wisconsin Game: Super Bowl XXXV Dayne was a rookie when the New York Giants advanced to Super Bowl XXXV, where the team was humiliated by the Baltimore Ravens  
In fact, winning Super Bowl teams have featured a Heisman winner on the roster only nine times. The last Heisman winner to claim a ring before Woodson was fellow Packer Desmond Howard, who earned MVP honors in Super Bowl XXXI in 1997 thanks to his 99-yard kickoff return for a score. He is the only special teams player to win the MVP honor  
The Heisman-related trivia question for the week is who was the last Heisman winner to win a Super Bowl and the answer, for the 13th straight year, is Charles Woodson. Woodson, while a member of the Green Bay Packers, earned his ring in 2011 at Super Bowl XLV. Lamar Jackson was the last Heisman winner [] 
Of those three, only Allen has also been named a Super Bowl MVP. Overall, four Heisman winners have earned Super Bowl MVP honors. Allen (1984), Staubach (1972), Plunkett (1981) and Desmond Howard (1997). Smith’s seven receptions for 100 yards in his first Super Bowl appearance are both Heisman records. 
Allen became the fourth USC running back to win the Heisman while becoming the first player to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season. He is arguably the most decorated player in the history of football as he is the only player to win a national title, a Heisman, a Super Bowl, a Super Bowl MVP award and an NFL regular-season MVP award. 
T he intersection of Heisman Trophy winners and Super Bowl champions is a rare one, with only a select few achieving success at both levels of football glory. As we delve into the list of Heisman

Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson (2016) and Tampa Bay Buccaneer signal-caller Baker Mayfield (2017) will lace ‘em up this weekend as both are trying to become the first Heisman Trophy winner to win a Super Bowl since Charles Woodson (1997) in Super Bowl XLV in 2011.
