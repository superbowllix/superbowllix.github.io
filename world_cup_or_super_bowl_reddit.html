        <h2><strong>world cup or super bowl reddit super bowl tickets uk</strong></h2>
        <p>The World Cup is the biggest international tournament for the world's most popular sport. The super bowl is a massive cultural event in one country, for a sport nobody else much plays. Though 'better' is entirely subjective. 
Super bowl and it’s not even remotely close. And World Cup is only more rare for teams outside of Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, Spain and maybe 2 other teams. 
How is the Superbowl better than World Cup? Its more fun. World cup no USHER. 45M subscribers in the AskReddit community. r/AskReddit is the place to ask and answer thought-provoking questions.

Difference between World Cup and Super Bowl. Two of the most watched sporting events in the world are the World Cup and the Super Bowl. Drawing in hordes of rabid fans with every game, each has a fan base that reaches into the millions. 
Take a look at our comparison between two of the biggest sports championships in the world – the NFL’s Super Bowl and FIFA’s World Cup. 
In this article, we’ll compare the Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup, examining their history, audience, economic impact, and cultural significance. Although both events differ in structure and global reach, each leaves an indelible mark on the sporting landscape. [ez-toc] 
Although the NFL and the Super Bowl continue to hold the top ratings spot in the U.S., overall World Cup viewership dwarfs that of American football. During the 2022 World Cup final in 
Instead of the World Cup final, a fairer comparison would be to set the Super Bowl against the UEFA Champions League final. It’s by far the biggest game of the club soccer calendar. 
As someone who enjoys both footballs, the World Cup is definitely bigger. American football is only eleven minutes in 3 hours because it’s sort of like a game of chess. You have to predict what move your opponent is gonna make and try to call the correct counter to it. 
Last year the AVERAGE price for a Super Bowl ticket was $8600. That was more than the price for the most expensive ticket at the MLS Cup. The most expensive ticket at the Super Bowl was $70,000. MLS Cup may have had 3,000 more people in the seats. I would estimate the Super Bowl gate receipts were more than 8 times higher. 2. 
It's going to be easy to beat for the US in the 2031 world cup, I mean they first got knocked out from getting a direct space against a team that only went professional a season or two ago, Chile. Then they got knocked out by a team in the final qualification tournament of which most players play in the third tier of French rugby with exception  
The World Cup has competitors from almost every nation on earth, that's why it's every 4 years due to the length of qualifying to actually be one of the 36 teams competing in the final stages. To get to the superbowl you just have to buy a franchise, move it to a new city then compete for 5 months and a bit against some of the 32 teams to win  
Super bowl typically has 100-120m viewers, so clearly it’s a big event. However the champions league final has a lot more, in 2021 700 million people watched Chelsea win. This year is the World Cup finals as well, the final typically has 1 to 1.2 billion viewers, ten times more than the super bowl. 
Super Bowl for me just for the fact it’s single elimination. One bad half (or quarter) and you’re done. A team can go 16-12 and still win the championship, the superbowl champ HAS to go undefeated in the playoffs. 
Some fun stats in there. But overall, the World Cup is vastly bigger and the two tournaments aren’t exactly comparable with a single quantifiable metric. Even if the super bowl out-rated the World Cup in terms of worldwide viewing numbers, which it never would, I’d still argue the WC is bigger purely based on its reach and global immersion. 
The question I pose is why do American athletes, and fans alike, claim to be world champions when their side wins the Super Bowl, World Series, Basketball Finals or Stanley Cup? The NFL, MLB, NHL and NBA are competed between clubs from America and in a few from Canada as well.

The fact it is every year and there are only 32 possible winners plus all the parity measures means Super Bowl shouldn't even be close. The World Cup is held once every 4 years and 206 teams competed to win it. On top of that it's the most popular sport in the vast majority of the world and so the level is just so high. </p>
