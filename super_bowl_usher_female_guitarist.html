        <h2><strong>super bowl usher female guitarist super bowl music performers</strong></h2>
        <p>However, focusing on this feels a little churlish: no-one should be questioning H.E.R.’s playing credentials. What’s more, the Super Bowl is without doubt the country’s single largest entertainment platform and the fact that its centerpiece is a killer guitar solo – from a Black female artist, no less – is cause for celebration. 
Usher brought the house down with a hit-filled Super Bowl halftime show. But for some viewers, the highlight was an electrifying guitar solo from a female rocker. 
Everyone, pay attention: That was H.E.R. who joined Usher on stage for a searing electric guitar solo during the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show.It was was not, as some brilliant minds on social

Vallejo-native H.E.R. joined headliner Usher and other musicians like Alicia Keys on Sunday during the halftime show at the Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers. 
The synchronicity of H.E.R. playing this particular Super Bowl halftime show can't be understated: When she was ten years old, the 26-year-old — performing then as Gabi Wilson — played an Alicia Keys song on piano the Today Show, and at age 12 covered Keys' 2001 mega-hit Fallin' at the 2010 BET Awards. Keys, of course, was the first guest

DURHAM, N.C. (WTVD) -- As we head into Super Bowl Sunday, a Durham native is getting ready to take center stage alongside Usher at the Super Bowl's halftime show at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.  
As the countdown to Super Bowl LVIII continues, anticipation swirls around the main event: the halftime show. This year, R&amp;B and pop music fans are in for a treat as Usher will grace the stage. 
A missed the halftime show at the Super Bowl this year and wanted to see if the H.E.R. solo was good and if H.E.R. played the super bowl solo or if it was li 
Usher recruited famous collaborators like Alicia Keys, H.E.R., Lil Jon, Ludacris, will.i.am, and producer Jermaine Dupri to help perform their iconic hits at the Super Bowl halftime show. 
And it seems this custom variation of H.E.R.’s favoured Stratocaster was made on short notice, especially for the show. Donning the usual matching headstock and trio of Fender Vintage Noiseless pickups (found previously on her Blue Marlin 2023 model), this guitar hosts a dark chrome pickguard and custom Chrome Red finish. 
Usher brought out special guests including Alicia Keys, guitarist H.E.R., Lil Jon, and more during the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show. 
H.E.R. rocks out with an epic guitar solo as one of Usher's surprise guests during his Super Bowl halftime show in Las Vegas. </p>
