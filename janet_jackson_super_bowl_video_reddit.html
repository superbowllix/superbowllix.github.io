        <h2><strong>janet jackson super bowl video reddit super bowl latino food truck miami</strong></h2>
        <p>On the Monday after the incident at Super Bowl Sunday, CBS had Jackson release a written statement apologizing, taking full blame for what they were now calling an unfortunate “accident”. “The decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. 
The Super Bowl was always weirdly conventional, but the commercials were all weirdly edgy. Two years earlier, there was that Coor’s Light Superbowl commercial that was a parody of Tom T Hall’s “I Love (Little Baby Ducks)” but the punchline is having threesome with twins (because lesbianism and incest are comparable, and both acceptable  
The impressive musical lineup included Janet Jackson, Kid Rock, P. Diddy, Nelly, and Justin Timberlake in Houston. As the halftime extravaganza reached its peak, Jackson and Timberlake turned up the heat with a rendition of Timberlake's 2003 smash hit, Rock Your Body, but Timberlake accidentally yanked off a piece of Jackson's costume  
A young software programmer at PayPal named Jawed Karim is unable to find any video of the Jackson Super Bowl performance online. Frustrated in his attempts to find footage, Karim and some friends create a venue where people can easily upload and share video. Thanks to the scandal, YouTube is born in 2005. 
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple  
But that’s exactly how FCC chairman Michael Powell described the 2004 halftime show. Specifically the portion of the show that featured Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and the wardrobe malfunction seen around the world. The show’s other acts (yes, there were other performers) Kid Rock, P. Diddy and Nelly, all escaped Powell’s ire. 
The half time shows at Super Bowls have grown more and more spectacular over the years, and Super Bowl XXXVIII topped them all. As Justin Timberlake sang "Rock Your Body" onstage with Janet  
Timberlake returned to the Super Bowl halftime show in 2018 as a headliner, upsetting many including Jackson's father, Joe Jackson. "If he’s such a gentleman, he’d make sure Janet is there  
On February 1, 2004, Janet Jackson, then 38-years-old, and Justin Timberlake, then 23-years-old, caused a wake of mass cultural hysteria when, at the end of Jackson’s Super Bowl Halftime  
The last time Justin Timberlake took to the Super Bowl halftime stage in 2004 he was involved in the infamous Janet Jackson "wardrobe malfunction" perhaps the most widely-talked about moment in  
I’ve always wondered where Janets career would have been had the Super Bowl incident not have happened. We all know how bias the media is against women and especially women of color, being most evident in JT taking 0% of the blame and having Janets legacy nearly erased over 1 mistake. 
But if you watched the Hulu documentary the producer revealed Justin did the pull off several counts early. So he messed up, the producers didn’t cut to black soon enough when they realized it went wrong and obviously scum bag Moonves orchestrated an misogynistic and racist fueled black out and attempt at erasing her from pop culture history.

“On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
Janet would’ve become even more HUGE after the Super Bowl. Of course, the black listing would haven’t happened as well, so her albums from 00’s and beyond would’ve got so much MORE attention and success. 
Another thing people forget is that Janet Jackson had been famous for at least eighteen years at at the time of the Super Bowl. She released Control in 1986 and the Super Bowl occurred in 2004. I remember her career being a little on the decline at this point. I never stopped letting Janet be a megastar. 
Janet Jackson was and still is one of the best performers that ever existed on pop history and she got hurt really bad by what happend. What I feel is that a mistake happend with two persons on a national television event and only one got their career affect by that. 
An older lady had invited us over to have a super bowl party and watch the game on her big screen. When that happened the youth pastor just covered his face with his hands and ran out of the room lol 
Janet Jackson, P. Diddy, Nelly, Kid Rock, Jessica Simpson &amp; Justin Timberlake performed at the Half Time Show in Reliant Stadium Of Houston (Texas) Pour rappel ce Super Bowl avait opposé les New England Patriots (go go gooooo :D) aux Carolina Panthers et les Patriots l'avaient emporté 32 à 29. Le MVP avait été Tom Brady.
