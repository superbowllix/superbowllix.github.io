        <p>The game was the idea of Arch Ward, the sports editor of the Chicago Tribune and the driving force behind baseball's All-Star Game. [1] The game originally was a benefit for Chicago-area charities and was played at Soldier Field except for two years during World War II, in 1943 and 1944, when it was held at Northwestern University's Dyche Stadium in Evanston. 
The last game, a 24‑0 win by the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers in 1976, was played in a 'surreal' deluge.  Charley Trippi of the College All-Stars runs a sweep. Credit: Getty Images  
In 1976, 22-year-old Jackie Slater out of Jackson State played in a game that was known as the College All-Star Football Classic, where he and other college all-stars faced off against Joe Greene  
While we can’t conceive college players facing the seasoned players of the league at this age, there was a time when the college All-Stars team gave head-to-head competition to the pro players. In 1963, the Green Bay Packers witnessed the phenomenon firsthand, and the then-head coach wasn’t impressed. 
The Chicago Charities College All-Star Game was a preseason football tilt played annually (except 1974) from 1934 to 1976 between the National Football League champions and a team of star college seniors from the previous year. (There was one exception: The 1935 game involved the 1934 runner-up Chicago Bears instead of the champion New York  
Amazingly, in those days, they could. In the 1930s and 1940s, the best college players didn’t always choose to play pro football, and pro players weren’t necessarily better than college players. The first five College All-Star Games featured two wins by the college players, two ties, and only one win by the NFL team.

As an experiment, the College All-Star Game also becamefairly settled science. Though some scores were close, the reigning NFL champion won the last 12 matchups in this series; the Packers won three straight from 1966 to 1968, with final scores of 38-0, 27-0, and 34-17. 
Known as the Chicago Charities College All-Star Game, the contest was played every year but one between 1934 and 1976, with 1974 being the lone exception, cancelled due to that year’s NFL  
The last College All-Star game occurred on July 23, 1976, with the Pittsburgh Steelers capturing a rain-shortened battle. Overall, the NFL grabbed 31 victories, lost just nine, and two games ended in ties. The last win for the All-Stars was in 1963. 
The Chicago game was one of several "pro vs. rookie" college all-star games held across the United States in its early years; Chicago's game had the benefit of being the highest profile, with the Super Bowl champions facing off against the best college graduates from across the country (as opposed to the regional games that were held elsewhere). 
The All-Stars fought back on their next series, moving from their 20 to the Dallas 30 primarily thanks to short Tagge passes. But on a third-and-two play, Oregon HB Bobby Moore lost 12 yards when fumbling out of bounds on an option play and the resulting 49-yard field goal attempt by Marcol was blocked by DE Pat Toomay.

But back in the day, the NFL Champion/Super Bowl Champion would take on a College All-Star team in an exhibition game prior to the start of the next season. The game was called the Chicago College All-Star Game and it took place from 1934-1976 (with the exception of 1974, due to the NFL strike). 
One aspect of the College All-Stars Game still lives on: the first regular season game of each season is hosted by the defending Super Bowl champion. This tradition started in 2004 when the defending champion New England Patriots hosted the Indianapolis Colts at Gillette Stadium on Thursday, Sept. 9th. 
The Chicago Charities College All-Star Game was a preseason American football game played annually (except in 1974) from 1934 to 1976 between the National Football League champions and a team of star college seniors from the previous year. It was also known as the College All-Star Football Classic.[1] After the Super Bowl began, including the two seasons prior to the NFL/AFL merger, the Super  
Beginning in 1934, the Chicago College All-Star game served as the preseason kickoff to each NFL season. Conceived by Arch Ward of The Chicago Tribune (who also developed major league baseball’s annual All-Star Game), it matched the previous season’s NFL champion against a squad composed of top college players, many of whom were about to enter the pro ranks (in 1935, the runner-up Chicago

The 40 th annual College All-Star Game on July 27, 1973 featured the Miami Dolphins, undefeated NFL Champions of the 1972 season, against a group of All-Stars coached by John McKay of USC. The Dolphins, under Head Coach Don Shula, featured a ball control offense led by power-running FB Larry Csonka (pictured at right), and QB Bob Griese was
