        <p>Below are 30 of the best Super Bowl Eagles memes that captured the energy, pride, and downright pettiness that followed the big win of the Eagles against the Commanders as they head on to play in  
Last year, Ecuador and Mexico broke off diplomatic relations after Noboa ordered a raid on the Mexican embassy to arrest a former Ecuadorean vice president. Reuters Democrats blocked from entering  
Here are a bunch of Super Bowl memes more memorable than the game itself. As exciting as the game was, its most memorable and meme-able moments came outside of the in-game action, from Rihanna's backup dancers to Eagles coach Nick Sirianni bawling his eyes out during the national anthem. 
Other honorable mentions are the Christina Augiela wrong lyrics meme (we will never let her live that moment down), Super Bowl scripted memes, and the Spongebob half-time show that the NFL blue  
But what truly makes the Super Bowl memorable are the moments that live on long after the final whistle. From game-changing plays to halftime surprises, every Super Bowl is filled with unforgettable highlights. And in today's digital age, football fans unite online to share their reactions through a flood of hilarious memes. 
For the non-sports fans out there, Super Bowl LVIII was a big day in television for every reason except the football. So if you're still shaking off the hangover from the Travis Kelce vs. Taylor Swift signature cocktails that your bestie made, I've got the memes to cure you. 
The biggest live sports event of the year is almost guaranteed to be turned into hilarious Super Bowl memes. The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of live sports, drawing in roughly 100 million viewers to watch the NFL championship each year. And like any live event, there’s always unexpected fun to be

Super Bowl 59 Game Prop: A Non-QB to Throw a Passing TD (+1300) We’ve got a fun little trend brewing in the Super Bowl — non-quarterbacks slinging touchdowns, and I’m cashing in. San Francisco’s Jauan Jennings just cashed in during Super Bowl 58, hitting Christian McCaffrey on a 21-yard dime off a double screen. 
Taylor Swift’s presence at last year’s Super Bowl took things to another level. The global music superstar and girlfriend of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was in the stands, though Swifties might have expected more screen time—she was only shown three times during the first half. 
The NFL regular season is in the books after a messy Week 18. Andy Behrens joins Matt Harmon to breakdown what you should actually care about from Week 18 for the 2025 fantasy season. 
In Super Bowl LI, the Falcons were beating the Patriots 21-3 at halftime. They increased their lead to 28-3 midway through the 3rd quarter, at which point, the Falcons let the Patriots put up 31 unanswered points. That was the worst collapse in Super Bowl history. In yesterday's game, the Eagles led 24-14 at halftime. A ten point lead at halftime. 
Which brings us back to this year, Super Bowl LIX. “I love this conspiracy theory,” says Alex Mount (CFA’07), a creative director for the National Football League and part of the team that designs the Super Bowl logos each year. “I love that anyone thinks I have any idea who’s going to win the Super Bowl. 
As of December 2024, the last time the New York Jets won a Super Bowl was in 1969. It was Super Bowl III which was played at the Orange Bowl stadium in Miami, Florida. The Jets won the match  
The Jets' best chance to reach the Super Bowl after the Super Bowl III victory was thwarted by A.J. Duhe in 1983 whose interception return for touchdown on a rain-soaked field in the conference championship game was the decisive score. [117] This remains as the lone postseason meeting in the series. [118] 
It's hard to determine but the X account @NFL_Memes shared a graphic just before last year's AFC and NFC championship games showing the connection between Super Bowl logos and the teams involved. Of course, the meme lost steam last year when the Chiefs upended the Ravens in the AFC championship game and went on to defeat the San Francisco 49ers  </p>
