This year, the Super Bowl will air on Fox. The biggest wild card for Super Bowl LIX is Tubi, a FAST service.

Instead, Super Bowl 59 will be broadcast on Fox - coincidentally, the same network that broadcast Super Bowl 57, which also featured the Chiefs versus the Eagles. 
Charissa Thompson thanked Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni for taking the time for an interview ahead of Super Bowl LIX. Charissa Thompson sat down with Nick Sirianni before the big game. 
We have reached Super Bowl 58, with the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs playing for the championship. It’s CBS’ turn in the Super Bowl rotation to broadcast the game. As you would expect, CBS is going all out with an expanded pregame show, additional reporters for the game, and an alternate broadcast for kids on Nickelodeon.
