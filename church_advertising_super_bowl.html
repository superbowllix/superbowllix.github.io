        <p>An ad for the Catholic prayer app Hallow, featuring actor Mark Wahlberg, also broadcast in select markets during the game. This is the 12th consecutive year the Church of Scientology has premiered a new ad during the Super Bowl, said spokesperson Erin Banks. 
In between star-studded advertisements and a whole lot of football, this year’s Super Bowl watchers are being taken to church. “He Gets Us,” a campaign to promote Jesus and Christianity, is  
It’s becoming a Super Bowl tradition: He Gets Us, the billion-dollar effort to overhaul the public image of Jesus, the Son of God, will be back on the airwaves during Super Bowl LIX. Greg Miller  
A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines. 
The group behind the campaign has also purchased an advertisement slot for this Sunday's Super Bowl, one of the most expensive brand platforms out there. The estimated costs for those ads will run  
A group called He Gets Us ran two ads during the Super Bowl game on Sunday to spread the word about Jesus. One of the donors behind the ads is a craft chain billionaire worth nearly $15 billion. 
The He Gets Us ads running during the Super Bowl, the most watched U.S. event of the year, were created by a nondenominational group to share the message of Christ’s love to whole new audiences. 
The Super Bowl had at least four offerings from religious organizations. "He Gets Us" scored two ads during the game.  The Church of Scientology also aired a 60-second commercial called "Decide  
A California church created a humorous Doritos ad that aired in 2010 after winning the snack brand’s Super Bowl ad contest. On Sunday, one “He Gets Us” ad will be shown during each half. One will focus on how children demonstrate Jesus’ love, while the other deals with anger, and how Jesus modeled a different way. 
The "He Gets Us" campaign is spending millions of dollars on its Super Bowls ads to promote Jesus. NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Josiah Daniels about the campaign and its purpose. 
The going rate for a Super Bowl ad can reach $7-8million for 30 seconds of screentime on TV during the game itself and companies go all-out when it comes to big-name appearances. 
Super Bowl halftime show headliner Kendrick Lamar looks back on the moments that set him up for success to perform at the Super Bowl – including how to split $5 at Church’s Chicken. 
Super Bowl Sunday, February 9, is going to be one to remember. No matter which team you’re cheering for (or even if you’re just here for the snacks), we can all agree on one thing: the commercials are the best part of game day! 
Buying Super Bowl ads in a country that is defunding healthcare and SNAP, that is transporting people to a concentration camp is some powerful de-evangelization by this “church.”
