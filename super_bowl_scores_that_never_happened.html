        <p>Missing Game Scores in Pro Football History. A summary of possible game scores up to 70-70 that have never happened in NFL/AFL/AAFC history. Looking for all games with a particular score? Search for any game score in pro football history, or see every final score that has ever happened. 
Scorigami is a concept thought up by Jon Bois. It is the art of building final scores that have never happened before in NFL history. Due to the unique nature of how points are scored in (American) Football, where it is impossible to score 1 point on its own, as well as the rarity of the 2 point safety and 8 point touchdown and 2 point conversion, there are a lot of scores that are possible  
We had heard that the final score of the Super Bowl -- 43-8, as you know -- had never happened in NFL history (at least not in any game recorded after 1920).  20-17 is the most common score  
This dream Super Bowl has nearly happened so many times. In 2010, the year Rodgers led the Packers to the Super Bowl, the Patriots were the Number 1 seed in the AFC but got upset in the playoffs by Mark Sanchez(!) and the Jets. In 2011 Brady got the Patriots to the Super Bowl, but the 15-1 one-seeded Packers got upset by a 9-7 Giants team. 
The Super Bowl is one of the greatest sporting events in NFL history. It matches the best NFL teams up against one another in a game viewed by millions each year 
Scorigami is a word I made up. It is the art of achieving a final score in an NFL game that has never happened before. As you might expect, this is pretty difficult to do, but it happened five  
It is important to note that specific score outcomes are impossible due to the scoring rules in place. Specifically, results such as 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, and 7-1 are not viable. This is  
Not good enough to be the greatest Super Bowl matchup that never happened, though. Below are the top 10 dream Super Bowls the world missed out on, based on a variety of factors -- I looked at top

In sports, a scorigami (a portmanteau of score and origami) is a final score that has never happened before in a sport or league's history. [1] The term was originated by sportswriter Jon Bois for American football scores in the National Football League (NFL) and is primarily used in this context; it has also been applied sparingly across other  
With the NFL playoffs well underway and the AFC and NFC Championship Games mere days away, fans are more intrigued than ever to find out which two franchises will battle on the ultimate stage for  
A scorigami has occurred in three of 58 Super Bowls (5.2%), with the most recent coming in Super Bowl 48 when the Seattle Seahawks defeated the Denver Broncos 43-8. 
This prop bet lets you wager on whether Super Bowl 58 will end with a final score that’s never been seen in NFL history. Now that’s betting on history being made! So there you have it – a sneak peek into the wild world of Super Bowl prop bets. 
A final score (both teams) that have never happened before. For example when the Seahawks won the super bowl against Denver the score was 43-8. Never before in any NFL game in history of the NFL was there ever that exact score (of the thousands and thousands of games played)! 
The third and most recent Super Bowl scorigami happened in 2014 when the Seattle Seahawks defeated the Broncos 43-8 in Super Bowl XLVIII. That’s some NFL trivia fans in Denver would like to forget. 
It is important to note that specific score outcomes are impossible due to the scoring rules in place. Specifically, results such as 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, and 7-1 are not viable. This is  
A big reason the Bills won is because they got another epic performance from Josh Allen, who totaled 430 yards and four touchdowns in the win.Allen's performance overshadowed Jared Goff, who threw  
Football fans have become enthusiastic about “scorigamis” in recent seasons — final scores that have never happened before in NFL history.  The second Super Bowl scorigami happened in  </p>
