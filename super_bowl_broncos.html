How many times have the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl? The Denver Broncos have won a total of 3 Super Bowls, in 1997-1998 and 2015. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in Denver. 
The Denver Broncos are one of the most successful teams in the NFL and have three Super Bowl wins to their name. The Broncos won Super Bowl XXXII (1997), Super Bowl XXXIII (1998), and Super Bowl  
The Broncos repeated as Super Bowl champions the following season, defeating the Atlanta Falcons (led by Elway's longtime head coach Dan Reeves) in Super Bowl XXXIII, 34–19. Elway was named Super Bowl MVP, completing 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards, with an 80-yard touchdown to wide receiver Rod Smith and one interception. [36] 
Super Bowl XXXII was an American football game played between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion and defending Super Bowl XXXI champion Green Bay Packers and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1997 season. 
The Broncos finally put their Super Bowl jinx behind them in 1998 and 1999 as the great John Elway led Denver to their first two championships. Another disappointment followed in 2014 against the Seahawks, but Denver's most recent appearance in a Super Bowl was a winning one thanks in large part to a standout defensive performance from now  
Super Bowl XXIV was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1989 season.

When/Where: Jan. 31, 1999, at Pro Player Stadium (Miami) What happened: The defending champion Broncos dominated the regular season and closed the deal in the Super Bowl. Elway played his final game and ended his career with back-to-back titles and a Super Bowl MVP.

FILE - In this Jan. 31, 1988, file photo, Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway winds up to let go of a 56-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ricky Nattiel in the first quarter of Super Bowl XXII against the Washington Redskins in San Diego, Calif. Elway threw the pass on the Broncos' first play from scrimmage and Rich Karlis kicked a 24-yard field goal on the next possession to take a 10-0  
Von Miller forced two fumbles to set up Denver's two touchdowns, and the Broncos' defense frustrated Cam Newton all game to carry Peyton Manning to his second Super Bowl win in a 24-10 victory. 
The Broncos were making their seventh Super Bowl appearance after also posting a 13–3 record. [14] This marked one of the few times that two former divisional rivals met in a Super Bowl, as the Seahawks and Broncos were in the same division (the AFC West) from 1977 to 2001. [15]

The Broncos' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. [139] Manning was sacked five times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks, and is the only such player to do so and record an interception.
