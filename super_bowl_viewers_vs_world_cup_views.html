The Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup wield considerable cultural and social influence, though in different contexts. In the U.S., the Super Bowl has become a cultural phenomenon. Super Bowl Sunday is an unofficial national holiday, with parties, family gatherings, and special events taking place across the country.
