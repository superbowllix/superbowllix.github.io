Since its national launch in 2022, the He Gets Us campaign, which says it aims to "remind people that the story of Jesus belongs to everyone," has been criticized over being backed by funders who  
A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines. 
But in this scenario, "He" is the center of a marketing campaign that has spread far across the U.S., spanning between billboards, banner ads online, and a forthcoming Super Bowl commercial. 
It’s becoming a Super Bowl tradition: He Gets Us, the billion-dollar effort to overhaul the public image of Jesus, the Son of God, will be back on the airwaves during Super Bowl LIX. Greg Miller  
More than just Super Bowl commercials, the He Gets Us campaign first surfaced in March 2022 and has been causing waves through TV spots, billboards, and digital ads.  “We simply want everyone

So, our idea is, let's tell the story. As a Christian, you should love everybody. Jesus loved everybody," said Green. The "He Gets Us" campaign will run a 60-second ad in the first quarter of the Super Bowl and a 15-second follow-up in the second half, according to AdAge.

So for $20 million, He Gets Us will have two opportunities to reach viewers for Jesus through Super Bowl commercials. The hope is that this isn’t just a one-year thing. “Once you’re with the NFL as an approved advertiser and then you invest $20 million to have two spots in the Super Bowl, people go, ‘OK, that’s big. 
A 60-second commercial about Jesus that aired during the Super Bowl was the second-most engaging advertisement during the broadcast of the game. EDO, a compa 
There is no better opportunity for advertisers than the Super Bowl, which is watched by an average of more than 100 million Americans each year. Naturally, the price of running a commercial during

The 2024 Super Bowl featured a "He Gets Us" commercial. Viewers who caught it may be wondering about the song played during and who the voice behind it was. 
Most Super Bowl adverts plug things like fizzy drink and cars, but one of the most talked-about commercials the day after the big game was selling Jesus - and it upset several very different

For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” The campaign’s website received 715,000 views in the previous 24 hours.
