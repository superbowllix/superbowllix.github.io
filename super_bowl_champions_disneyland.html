The winner of Super Bowl 58 will be headed toDisneyland! The post-Super Bowl celebration can be traced back to 1987 when Phil Simms uttered the famous line “I’m going to Disney World”. Simms and his family were then treated to a day at Magic Kingdom and a tradition was born. 
The Superbowl Champions will celebrate their victory at Disneyland. This celebration will take place on Monday, February 13, 2023. No times or further announcements have been made regarding the celebration, but I am hopeful they will share on their social media platforms like they did last year.
