        <h2><strong>super bowl over under turnovers super bowl halftime show time</strong></h2>
        <p>* Concerning Super Bowl totals, in the 57 games that had posted numbers, Over is 39-18 (68.4%) and Under is 38-18-1 (67.9%) on 6-point teasers. For the 2024 game, both Over and Under teaser bettors won handily.

Super Bowl game scoring based on the passing and rushing characteristics of the two teams involved. Total scoring in the Super Bowl based on how the opponents ranked in sack rate and turnover margin. Super Bowl Over/Under Trends By Line Value 
Taking out two pushes and one pick ’em game, favorites are 28-27 (51%) in the game against the spread. The over/under is split exactly down the middle with 29 games going over the total and 29 staying under (Super Bowl I had no over/under odds posted, but one would have to assume it would have gone over with 45 points scored). 
The Eagles won 21-17 as 2.5-point underdogs with the Under (46) cashing. In the Chiefs’ Super Bowl LVII 38-35 victory, they were 1-point underdogs as the Over (51) easily cashed. Kansas City had 158 rushing yards and 182 passing yards, while posting a plus-1 turnover margin. 
The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
Understanding Super Bowl Point Spread &amp; Totals. The Super Bowl point spread is a handicap applied to create a more balanced betting field. For Super Bowl 59, the Chiefs are -1.5-point favorites (-115 at BetMGM). This meant the Kansas City Chiefs need to win by at least two points to cover this spread. On the flip side, the Eagles needed to lose  
Favorites are 28-28-2 in the 58 Super Bowls that have been contested. The UNDER is 29-28 in Super Bowl betting history. There was no total posted for Super Bowl 1. This year's Big Game will be a  
8. In the Super Bowl, the team with the half-time lead has gone 14-4 SU, 11-7 ATS (61%), and an 8-10 Over-Under. 9. In the Super Bowl, Underdogs that had the halftime lead have gone 7-1 SU and 5-3 Over-Under. 10. Teams with a 6 or more-point lead at the half have gone 9-1 SU, 8-2 ATS (80%) including a 7-3 Over-Under. a. 
The ‘over/under’ has gone 29-28 in the first 58 Super Bowl matchups. No total was posted on Super Bowl I between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. In the 2019 Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. 
How Often Does the Total Go Over or Under in the Super Bowl? As we shift to focus on the total, we'll once again lean on Pro Football Reference's data. Their archive doesn't have a total listed for Super Bowl I, so we'll focus on just the other 57 for these purposes. In those 57 games, the total has gone over 28 times (49.1%). 
Nothing can swing the Super Bowl more than a key turnover, and the Super Bowl odds have interceptions props available on Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes and Eagles pivot Jalen Hurts.. My NFL picks  
And, of course, the Philly Philly — Trey Burton to Nick Foles in Super Bowl 52 — an all-time legendary trick play. But let’s not forget the failed attempts. New England’s Danny Amendola lobbed one over Tom Brady’s head in that same Super Bowl against the Eagles, and Patriots wideout Julian Edelman misfired the year before. 
This prop could be a fun one too. When it comes to Super Bowl Defensive Props, the amount of miscues is in question. Yes, 2.5 seems like a reasonably low number. Like we mentioned before, both teams have been capable of easily creating multiple turnovers. Over 2.5 Turnovers (+145 via Bovada) Under 2.5 Turnovers (-195 via Bovada) 
Kansas City has won its last three Super Bowl coin tosses. Further, it has won nine this season and deferred every single time. Seeing as the Chiefs are the designated visitors in Super Bowl 2025  
We love the Eagles (-102) to win Super Bowl 59 straight up. Make a bet on Jalen Hurts Longest Rush Prop (12.5) at -121 odds. Make bank with our top Super Bowl 59 picks!
