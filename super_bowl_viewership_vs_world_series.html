        <p>In 1977, Super Bowl XI was watched by 81.9 million total viewers, beating the Game 7 viewership of the 1975 World Series and becoming the most-watched sports broadcast in American history. [69] 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
World Cup vs Super Bowl Viewership The 2021 Super Bowl between Tom Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs was the least-watched Super Bowl since 2008. 
UEFA Champions League Final – 450 Million Viewers; Super Bowl – 115.1 Million Viewers; Wimbledon – 25.6 Million Viewers; NBA Finals – 17.8 Million Viewers; World Cup of Rugby- 17 Million Viewers; Kentucky Derby – 16.6 Million Viewers; The Masters – 15 Million Viewers; World Series – 14.73 Million Viewers; NCAA Final Four – 14.7

Prior to 2020, the only World Series game with less than 10 million viewers had been Game 3 in 2008, [11] which was impacted by a rain delay and had 9.836 million viewers. [12] The most recent World Series game to record a rating of 30 or higher was Game 7 in 1991, as the Minnesota Twins defeated the Atlanta Braves; the game had a viewership of

Quite honestly, I don’t think so. The Super Bowl already enjoys such massive rating advantages, so it may be too late to reverse the trend. Realistically, it takes a seven-game World Series to match the viewing totals of the Super Bowl. I guess a one-game series could improve ratings, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. 
Is The Super Bowl Losing Popularity? The Super Bowl is undoubtedly the most watched broadcast in the US year after year. According to the NFL, the highest Super Bowl viewership in NFL history was Super Bowl LVII in 2023, with 115 million views. The last time the NFL saw numbers like that was Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 with 114 million viewers.
