Kyle Shanahan's Super Bowl History. In full-circle fashion, Shanahan's initial victorious big-game trip came when he was in high school.

With a win in Super Bowl LVIII, Kyle Shanahan and his father Mike would become the first father-son duo in NFL, NBA, NHL or MLB history to each win a championship as a head coach. pic.twitter.com  
Shanahan called some runs from 28-3 through 28-20, but the passes were significantly more successful than the runs, and both RBs were hurt. Look at the run yardages: -1 (holding), 8, 1, 2, -1. You're not burning off a quarter and a half in a few drives with that running game.
