        <h2><strong>super bowl champions baltimore ravens super bowl 2025 ring</strong></h2>
        <p>Baltimore Ravens A (1, 1–0)  In the intervening year, they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos. 
Super Bowl XLVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2012 season. 
That was when the Colts represented Charm City. Led by legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas, the Colts defeated the then-Oakland Raiders, 27-17. Now, 53 years later, Baltimore will hope for a long-awaited conference championship celebration  and a potential third Super Bowl parade after Feb. 11 for the Ravens. 
The Baltimore Ravens last won the Super Bowl in the 2012 season. The Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in the Super Bowl. 
Coming off as the defending Super Bowl champions, this was the first year in franchise history for the team without Ray Lewis. [82] The Ravens started out 3–2, and started the 2–0 Houston Texans 14-loss streak by shutting them 30–9 in Week 3. 
Relive the Baltimore Ravens journey to Super Bowl XXXV in the 2000 season.  Diary of the Ravens World Championship Season", published in July of 2001.  
Super Bowl rematches. If the Ravens advance to the Super Bowl, they'll face the winner of the NFC championship game between the No. 3 seed Lions and No. 1 seed 49ers. 
On Feb. 3, 2013, the AFC Champion Ravens battled the NFC Champion 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. It was the first time in NFL history that two brothers, John and Jim Harbaugh, faced each other as head  
The Ravens’ two Super Bowl appearances were both wins. In Super Bowl XXXV, which was played on Jan. 28, 2001, Baltimore recorded a dominant 34-7 victory over the New York Giants . Baltimore allowed only 152 yards of offense by New York — the third-lowest total ever in a Super Bowl — while also recording four sacks and forcing five turnovers. 
The formula for the Baltimore Ravens at the Super Bowl is simple: Make it to the big game and win. Baltimore has played in two Super Bowls and won both of them, scoring 34 points in each. They have yet to taste defeat on the grandest stage, but they also only make it to the title game every decade or so. 
Believe It, Baltimore, your Ravens are once again Super Bowl Champions! With their thrilling 34-31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, the Ravens put an exclamation point at the end of Ray Lewis' Hall Of Fame career, and rode the talents of Lewis, quarterback Joe Flacco, tailback Ray Rice and a host of others to the second World Championship in franchise history.

The Baltimore Ravens have won 2 Super Bowls as they were crowned champions of the 2000 and 2012 NFL seasons. They defeated the Giants 34-7 in Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 and they beat the 49ers 34-31 in 2013 in Super Bowl XLVII. 
Yet Jackson hasn't delivered on the Super Bowl promise he made to Baltimore on the night he was drafted in 2018. The Ravens pride themselves on constantly being in contention. 
He's always been a legend to us but it was the magic of a quarter-of-a-century of memories flooding back on the field when Super Bowl XXXV champion center Mike Flynn returned to the Baltimore Ravens as a "Legend of Game" with his family and personal tales of Lamar support for MVP. And Costas crabs, of course on his way outta town
