        <p>The first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (known retroactively as Super Bowl I and referred to in contemporaneous reports, including the game's radio broadcast, as the Super Bowl) [5] was an American football game played on January 15, 1967, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California.

Super Bowl History 
With Super Bowl LIX set for February 9, 2025, let's review the history of the game. The first-ever AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional American football is also known as Super Bowl I  
The Packers won Super Bowl 1 and Super Bowl 2, but the AFL soon got its revenge in Super Bowl 3. New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed a victory over the Baltimore Colts and ultimately delivered with a 16-7 win, giving the AFL its first Super Bowl win. The Chiefs, losers of Super Bowl 1, won their first Super Bowl trophy in Super Bowl 4.

The Super Bowl has topped television ratings in the United States every year since the first championship game in 1967. This has made commercial time during its broadcast the most expensive of any televised event in the United States. 
The first Super Bowl in Las Vegas, this was a rematch of Super Bowl LIV between the 49ers and the Chiefs, and was the Chiefs' fourth Super Bowl appearance in five years. The second Super Bowl to go into overtime, the Chiefs came back from another 10-point deficit to win their third Super Bowl in five years and secure back-to-back championships  
The Early Years and the First Super Bowl.  Brady and the Patriots’ first Super Bowl victory is the second-biggest upset. The then-St. Louis Rams closed as a 14-point favorite in Super Bowl  
Super Bowl LI (New England Patriots 34, Atlanta Falcons 28, Feb. 5, 2017): In this epic game, the Patriots overcame a 25-point deficit to win in the Super Bowl's first overtime game. Super Bowl MVPs 
All 13 kickoffs went for touchbacks, marking the first Super Bowl ever without a kickoff return and providing the final impetus for the NFL to approve one of its most significant rules changes in years by completely overhauling the kickoff. 
Entering Super Bowl 59 this year, Philadelphia has been to four NFL title games and holds a 1-3 record in Super Bowl matchups. The Eagles lost in each of their first two Super Bowl appearances. 
Inflation hit marketers’ advertising budgets for a Super Bowl LIX commercial. Last year’s 30-second slots went for $7 million, but according to Mark Evans, Fox Sports executive vice president  
Look for familiar celebrity cameos and see some first-time advertisers this year.  Super Bowl viewers are a unique audience because they’re as primed to watch the ads as they are the game. 
Kansas City's first two Super Bowl appearances came in the first four years of the event's existence. The Chiefs lost Super Bowl 1 and won Super Bowl 4 before enduring a 50-year championship game  
Best Super Bowl commercial every year since 2000: Looking back on the best ads of the last 25 years  It was fair to wonder where this ad was going when it first began, but it ended on a funny  
Super Bowl 59 between the Chiefs and Eagles is now only four days away from the Super Bowl rematch from only two years ago where Kansas City started its quest for a three-peat. 
Online Super Bowl betting is growing every year and projected to be $1.5 billion this year, a 15 percent increase from last year. There are more than 225 million Americans now eligible to legally bet online, almost two-thirds of the American population. </p>
