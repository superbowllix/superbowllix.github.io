Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. 
Credit: Disney. As most marketed celebrity visits to Disney parks go, the winning Super Bowl team’s trip the Walt Disney World Resort or Disneyland is not really comprised of an actual vacation  
One of the Super Bowl's most famous and long-established traditions has nothing do with football, let alone the NFL. Every year, the Super Bowl MVP proclaims "I'm going to Disney World!" to an  
The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom. 
The last MVP to be awarded a free vehicle was New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, following Super Bowl LI (51), and he didn’t even keep it. He immediately gave his new Chevrolet Colorado to teammate Malcom Butler, who saved the Patriots’ Super Bowl victory that year with an interception in the closing moments. 
Usually, the ‘MVP’ winner visits Disney World after the game, normally with a teammate and their families, which Mahomes has done in each of the last two years. 
The Super Bowl MVP is not obligated to attend the parade or visit the park, but most attend and participate. The players are usually compensated up to $70,000 for their visit and quick TV promo. 
(Feb. 3, 2014): Super Bowl XLVII MVP Malcolm Smith rides Feb. 3, 2014 with Mickey Mouse in a parade through the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Smith, a linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks, helped lead his team to a 43-8 victory last night over the Denver Broncos in East Rutherford, N.J. 
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. 
Super Bowl XL Co-MVP and Pittsburgh Steelers' Hines Ward waves to fans as he rides with Mickey Mouse in a celebratory parade at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Monday, Feb. 6, 2006. 
Super Bowl winners have visited Disney since 1987, when then-New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms first made the exclamation after his team's victory. Brady, who had previously made multiple trips as a member of the New England Patriots, made a much shorter trip this year traveling down I-4 from Tampa to Buena Vista. 
However, with this year’s game in New Orleans, the pendulum seems poised to swing back to Walt Disney World in Florida. If the winning team does head to Walt Disney World, fans can expect a magical celebration on Main Street, U.S.A., featuring the Super Bowl MVP waving to crowds, perhaps joined by a few teammates. 
In his 1998 memoir Work in Progress, Disney CEO Michael Eisner credited his wife, Jane, with the idea for the campaign. [5] According to Eisner, during the January 1987 grand opening for the Star Tours attraction at Disneyland, the couple dined with Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who in December 1986 had piloted the first aircraft to fly around the world without stopping or refueling. 
Credit: Disney. Mahomes and Brady will face off with their respective teams on Sunday, February 7 at 6:30 PM EST for Super Bowl LV. Who do you think will win Super Bowl MVP this year? 
The first Super Bowl was played in 1967 in Los Angeles. But the Disney World or Disney land phrase came into inception two decades later. So who is going to utter these famous words this time around? 
In 2019, Super Bowl LII MVP Julian Edelman was joined by his teammate, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, to celebrate at Walt Disney World. 05 of 13 Nick Foles 
The most recent was 2006 NBA Finals MVP Dwyane Wade, who joined teammate Udonis Haslem as  - took a trip to Disney World after breaking their team's 86-year title drought. We've even seen non

Flacco will travel from New Orleans to Orlando today to take part in a Super Bowl-themed party at the park. This is the 26th time an NFL player has shouted an endorsement for a Disney theme park  </p>
