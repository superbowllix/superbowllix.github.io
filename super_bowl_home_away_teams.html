        <p>Three of those Super Bowl champions opted to wear their white away jerseys, so teams wearing their home jerseys have only won 21 times (.362). Recent history has favored road teams in the Super  
The team's will meet up again after squaring off two seasons ago in Super Bowl LVII, with the Chiefs beating the Eagles in a nail biter 38-35 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. 
The Chiefs were the home team in Super Bowl LVIII a season ago. As for what the “home” designation means, it allows that team — this season the Eagles — to pick their uniform for the game  
The Philadelphia Eagles will represent the NFC in Super Bowl 59 at the Superdome in New Orleans. The way it works with home and away teams in Super Bowls is the AFC is the home team in even-numbered Super Bowls. The odd-numbered games make the NFC team the home team. That makes the Eagles the home team in Super Bowl 59. 
The Super Bowl LIX uniform matchup is set. The Kansas City Chiefs will wear their away white uniforms on Feb. 9 when they take on the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles, who will wear their home greens. 
This makes the 49ers the away team. • 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1)  Since the league chooses to switch home teams at the Super Bowl every year, here's a simple  
Super Bowl 58 is officially set as the San Francisco 49ers will battle the Kansas City Chiefs at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The game will take place on Sunday, February 11 at 6:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on CBS. For this year’s Super Bowl, Kansas City will be considered the home team while San Francisco will considered the away  
The Chiefs have only lost one SB wearing the red, which was Super Bowl 55 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers when Tampa was the home team. Of their five Super Bowl appearances, KC owns a 2-1 overall  
For Super Bowl 55, that means the Buccaneers are the home team while the Chiefs are the away team. It's purely coincidental that the designations align with the game being played in Tampa Bay's  
It was just four years ago that the Chiefs and 49ers faced off in the Super Bowl. Patrick Mahomes came away with his first Super Bowl victory, topping Jimmy Garoppolo and San Francisco in a 31-20  
The simple criteria used to decide Super Bowl home and away teams. In the other rounds of the NFL playoffs, teams who have performed better earlier in the competition are rewarded by playing at  
In 2023, the NFC team Philadelphia was the home team and for the 2024 Super Bowl, the AFC champion Kansas City will be the home team. This tradition started with the very first Super Bowl where the Green Bay Packers were the home team and it’s alternated back and forth each since since. 
Origins of Super Bowl Home/Away Process. The NFL prefers an alternating format. In one game, the NFC becomes the home rep. The following year, the AFC team gets the home designation. And the process rotates each game. This has long been the format for the Super Bowl since the first-ever contest between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City  
The Philadelphia Eagles are headed back to the Super Bowl, after knocking off the Washington Commanders by a final score of 55-23 in Sunday’s NFC Championship Game. On the other side of the  
Despite becoming the second team to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium, the Los Angeles Rams will be the "away" team for Super Bowl LVI. The reason is simple: the AFC and NFC alternate which  
This means an NFC team gets to be home in odd-numbered Super Bowls, and AFC teams are home for even-numbered Super Bowls. This first started during Super Bowl I, when the Green Bay Packers (NFC) were considered the home team. What Does It Mean to Be the Home Team in the Super Bowl? The Super Bowl is played at a location predetermined before the

The Rams are set to make history in Super Bowl 56. They will face the Bengals at SoFi Stadium and will become just the second team, along with the Buccaneers in 2021, to play a Super Bowl on their  
The Los Angeles Rams, on the other hand, were the away team in their home stadium for Super Bowl LVI. The Cincinnati Bengals chose to wear black jerseys and white pants for the game, while the  </p>
