        <p>American rapper Ice Spice was among celebrities who watched Super Bowl LVIII with Taylor Swift on Feb. 11, 2024. Because of that, Spice was prominently featured in many photos and videos from the  
About. Ice Spice's Satanic Hand Gestures and Upside-Down Cross at Super Bowl LVIII refers to conspiracy theories that rapper Ice Spice was purposely flashing supposed satanic hand signs and wearing an upside-down cross necklace at Super Bowl LVIII in mid-February 2024 whenever the camera switched to her sitting next to Taylor Swift.

Two prominent websites sought to downplay what many viewers believed to be a satanic moment at the Super Bowl. 
RAPPER Ice Spice has infuriated fans after they noted her outfit choice for Sunday's big game. Ice attended the Super Bowl with her friend Taylor Swift, 34, but fans were distracted by her behavior at the game. 
"The crowd booed the demonic hand sign at yesterday's Super Bowl," says a February 12, 2024 post on X, formerly Twitter. The post includes a short clip of Ice Spice sharing a box with pop star Taylor Swift at the NFL championship game.

Conspiracy theorists think Ice Spice was showing off ‘Satanic’ hand gestures at last night’s Super Bowl. The American rapper - whose real name is Isis Naija Gaston - joined her pals Taylor  
One claim of supposed celebrity satanism at the Super Bowl didn't even involve a performer at the halftime show. Claims spread on social media that Ice Spice wore an upside-down cross to the 2024  
Nevertheless, not all Super Bowl viewers saw red, as many highlighted Ice Spice’s feared hand gestures as the classic “rock on” sign, which she did while music was playing, HuffPost reported 
Rapper Ice Spice sparked satanic panic during the Super Bowl due to supposed demonic gestures. Ice Spice, Taylor Swift’s guest, was seen with an inverted cross, leading to bizarre conspiracy theories. Many social media users jumped to conclusions about Ice Spice's gestures being demonic due to an upside-down cross. 
Okay buddy, explain the upside down cross neckless she held up Okay. We found higher-resolution images of Spice at the Super Bowl in which her pendant appears to be a Greek (equal-armed) cross, rather than an inverted one, although according to TMZ and other sources, the piece, designed by Alex Moss, was indeed an upside-down — though not "satanic" — cross.
