        <p>Retailers will see a spike in returns of big screen TVs following the Super Bowl, and returns are growing due to more relaxed return policies, according to companies that track and manage retail  
Super Bowl Season’s Trends for TV Sales and Product Return Management. Overall, the Super Bowl season is a great time to be an electronics retailer. Last year's 2020 Super Bowl Survey conducted by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics predicted consumers would spend $1.5 billion on televisions. ReturnPro’s  
Our internal statistics from goTRG's dedicated returns centers see a spike in TV sales and returns during this time with a 36% increase in return rates post-Super Bowl. Retailers are advised to employ advanced returns management software, partner with refurbishment experts, and implement strict return policies to combat fraudulent returns. 
It is my job to sort, palletize and ship out unsalable returns. Most locations in the USA use a return depot to sell off returns. There are a few locations that don’t use return depots. It is possible that these locations, sell open box returns. Unfortunately, there is no way to know which locations do or don’t use a return depot 
— The day after the Super Bowl could be a tough one for electronics retailers, because of the number of people who bought a big screen TV for the Super Bowl, then decided to return it the next day. 
Eh. Mileage is going to vary greatly on this. Best Buy “Geek Squad Certifies” damn near anything now, TVs being their biggest item. You won’t get as much off as you think depending on their rating and in my experience (former Geek Squad) most of the TVs that came back after super bowl were in perfect condition and were certified very good/excellent and had nearly nothing marked down. 
All your Christmas returns and (soon) your post-Super Bowl TV returns have to be re-sold somewhere. We live in a return culture. But much of the stuff we take back bypasses the store shelf and is  
The first quarter represents the highest number of TV returns made all year. "This is very Super Bowl-centric," said Sean Cleland, head of mobile and consumer electronics at B-Stock.

Monday, February 3, 2025, to Sunday, February 9, 2025, brings a whole heap of exciting new and returning television. From beloved procedural spin-offs making their delayed return to one of the  
I worked at Best Buy through college and I don't think the Super Bowl returns thing is actually true. I worked in merchandising and inventory so I spent a lot of time handling returns and pricing. Honestly, I think we got fewer returns per unit sold throughout the holidays + Super Bowl.

All 13 kickoffs went for touchbacks, marking the first Super Bowl ever without a kickoff return and providing the final impetus for the NFL to approve one of its most significant rules changes in

It’s his second time making the Super Bowl, as he made Super Bowl LII with the Eagles in the 2017 season. This year, he’s facing the team he played for in his previous trip to the big game. 
Kansas City special teams coach Dave Toub has liked the rule in general but would be in favor of at least one change to increase the rate of returns even more.

The Super Bowl Soulful Celebration 2025 in New Orleans blends music, faith, and football, featuring incredible performances and inspiring tributes during Super Bowl LIX week. 
A year or two ago, I had a huge row of TV's that were straight open boxes after the Super Bowl. It didn't help that a lot of them were from the holidays / shelf displays that came down too. I had probably 25 on the floor with an additional 10 in the warehouse. 
Super Bowl squares. What looks like a bingo card is a 10-by-10 grid based on numbers and a fun game of chance. It’s an engaging way to stay focused while enjoying Super Bowl parties with friends
