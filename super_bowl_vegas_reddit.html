        <h2><strong>super bowl vegas reddit eagles super bowl win 2025 halftime show</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl is a bucket list event. Not sure if the SB IN Vegas will be "bucket list". I am sure it's gonna be over-hyped and over-priced. Traffic might be bad. The stadium looks a bit out of the way, especially if you don't stay "south strip". I am thinking that going to a Super Bowl (or Wrestle Mania) in New Orleans could be "bucket list  
The event itself feels very corporate. Fuck the Super Bowl, fly out and watch your team around the faithful and enjoy a real atmosphere at the NFC championship game and then fly to Vegas for the Super Bowl without going to the game. Get the better experience and enjoy Vegas while saving a shit load on the tickets

Hoover Dam; 2. Grand Canyon West; 3. Somewhere different! 
Itâ€™s a bit early, as usually the venues will promote New Yearâ€™s Eve celebrations and then turn to Super Bowl events once thatâ€™s done. Maybe it will be different this time with the game actually taking place in Las Vegas. In any event, youâ€™ll likely get more responses on the Las Vegas forum. 
February 7â€“10 Mandalay Bay, $25â€“$50 (free for kids) The Super Bowl Experience is designed to do one thing: get you as pumped up as possible for the Big Game.

Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money. 
Iâ€™m going to be in town for Super Bowl weekend Feb9-Feb12 and am looking for a good place to watch the game. Iâ€™m staying at The Orleans and they have a watch party in the Mardi Gras Ballroom. I found a Big Game Watch Party at Westgate, which looks awesome. My main question is has anyone been to the SB watch party at the Orleans ?

Confidence: Low - In three previous Super Bowl appearances, Mahomes has a 61.8% completion with five TDs and four INTs. He was clutch in the Super Bowl victories against the Niners and Eagles. Kelce has 23 receptions on 27 targets with 257 yards and three TDs in the playoffs, and that is going to be the key matchup against Warner and Greenlaw.
