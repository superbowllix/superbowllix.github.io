        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
In 1973 Griese started 13 regular-season games, and led the Dolphins to their third consecutive Super Bowl appearance, the first in NFL history and second consecutive Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl VIII, the second in NFL history. Over the next seven years Griese started 74 regular-season and three playoff games.

MIAMI – JANUARY 21: Terry Bradshaw quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers readies a pass during Super Bowl XIII against the Dallas Cowboys at the Orange Bowl on January 21, 1979 in Miami  
What Quarterback Has Started the Most Super Bowls? Over his career, Tom Brady has been to 10 Super Bowls, five more than second-place John Elway.In those 10 Super Bowl appearances, Brady boasts a 7-3 record. 
Widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks of the 1970s, Griese led the Dolphins to a then record three consecutive Super Bowl appearances, [1] including two Super Bowl victories in VII and VIII, [2] [3] the first of which capped off Miami's undefeated and untied 1972 season, the only such season in NFL history. 
Miami Dolphins. 2. VII, VIII. 0. Ben Roethlisberger. Pittsburgh Steelers. 2.  The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom Brady  
Bradshaw threw for 300-plus yards in half his Super Bowls which, in the 1970s, was the quarterback equivalent of going to the moon (Super Bowl XII, in 1978, featured 217 total net passing yards). 
The Super Bowl is more than a game —it’s the apex of American sports and culture. ON SI  Miami 3. VII. Jan. 14, 1973. Miami 14, Washington 7  Super Bowl. Bart Starr (QB) Green Bay  
Joe Theismann is the only other former Notre Dame quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl, leading the Washington Redskins to a 27-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the 17th big game. 
49ers QB Steve Young had six passing touchdowns in a 49-26 rout over the Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX. He had four touchdowns in the first half, and the game got so far out of reach that 49ers  
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles  
Cam Ward is buzzing with a lot of confidence ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft. The quarterback is seen as one of the top picks in the draft, following his strong 2024 season where he finished as  
Super Bowl XVII was the Redskins' first Super Bowl victory (third NFL championship overall) and their second Super Bowl appearance; they were defeated by the Dolphins, 14–7, in Super Bowl VII. This was the second rematch in Super Bowl history (the first being the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowls X and XIII  
Barkley is without a doubt the most likely non-quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP and the running back is currently priced at +260 with most USA bookmakers to take home the award. It is very rare that any player has better odds than either starting quarterback at the Super Bowl, but Barkley is priced significantly lower than teammate Jalen  
In the strike-shortened 1982 Miami Dolphins season, Woodley handled the lion's share of the time at quarterback en route to Miami winning the American Football Conference title. The Dolphins went on to face the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVII. At 24 years and three months of age, he was the youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl at  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Super Bowl VII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Miami Dolphins and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Washington Redskins to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1972 season. </p>
