        <p>The NFL Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. [2] [6] The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion. [2] The Green Bay Packers won the most NFL championships before the merger, winning eleven of the fifty  
The Green Bay Packers have won the most NFL championship titles with 13 (nine pre-Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls, including the first two AFL-NFL World Championship Games). The Chicago Bears have won the second most overall championships with nine (eight pre-Super Bowl era and one Super Bowl) and the New York Giants have won the third most  
Imagine if we separated Major League Baseball World Series titles the same way that we separate NFL Championships, pre-1966, from Super Bowl titles. The Dodgers have won five MLB crowns in the city of Los Angeles, but only two since the start of the Super Bowl era. (They lost three Series alone in the 1970s — what a disappointment! 
This is a list of National Football League (NFL) champions before the 1970 AFL–NFL merger. From 1920–1932, the league champion was determined by a team's win–loss percentage, with tied games omitted.[1] In 1932, because of a tie in the final standings, a playoff game was played to determine the championship.[2] In 1933, the NFL played its first official championship game.[2] On July 31  
The NFL championships describes both the Championship games of the National Football League, which ran from 1920 to 1969; and the Super Bowl, which has run from 1966 to the present. Many players and teams have won these championships on multiple occasions, both during the NFL championships and the Super Bowl era. 
1960–1969—The Super Bowl Begins . The fledgling American Football League jockeyed with the NFL for players and fans from 1960 through 1969. The teams began playing a championship game, dubbed the "Super Bowl" in 1967. Vince Lombardi's mighty Green Bay Packers dominated the first two championship matchups, winning in 1967 and 1968. 
The Super Bowl started to determine the world champions. The game featured the champion of each league. Beginning in 1970, the AFL and NFL played as one league with two conferences, the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference. 
But the Eagles managed a single touchdown to come out on top, 7-0. It remains the lowest-scoring championship game, pre and post-Super Bowl era, in NFL history. 7. 1963: Chicago Bears 14, New York Giants 10. This particular edition of the championship, the third-last before the Super Bowl era, was played under the backdrop of tragedy. 
However, the NFL Record &amp; Fact Book lumps all NFL Championship games in with the NFC Championship results. For a composite list of Super Bowls and pre-Super Bowl era championships, click here.

The Green Bay Packers have won the most NFL championship titles with 13 (nine pre-Super Bowl era NFL championships and four Super Bowls, including the first two AFL-NFL World Championship Games). The Chicago Bears have won the second most overall championships with nine (eight pre-Super Bowl era NFL championships and one Super Bowl). 
Cleveland Browns quarterback Otto Graham dominated professional football in the pre-Super Bowl era. From 1946-55, "Automatic Otto" led the Browns to 10 straight championship games—an achievement

Because, for the entirety of the 60s, there were 2 football leagues that have teams that currently exist. They both existed before the first Super Bowl. The first AFL-NFL Super Bowl was following the 1966 season. So for 1960-1965, there were AFL champions as well as NFL champions. Who claims the championship for those years? 
It applies to Baseball some what, it's just been 120 years now so people don't even realize it. The New York/San Francisco Giants won championships before the first World Series in 1901, but they're just referred to as the 8 time World Series Champion. 
It seems like whenever titles are counted, NFL Championships are counted as a different sort of championship than a Super Bowl -- obviously this is due to the original format of the game followed by the merger, but as a big basketball fan, it's odd to me that nobody seems to regard pre-ABA/NBA merger NBA titles as unique in the same way. </p>
