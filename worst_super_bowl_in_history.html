        <p>Not all Super Bowls are created equal: here are the very worst of them, from the Broncos vs. the Seahawks to the Raiders blowout by the Buccaneers. 
Among Super Bowl teams, the performances by the Baltimore Colts and Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V are among the worst in history. The Colts, for their part, managed to turn the ball over a whopping seven times, with four fumbles and three interceptions (via Pro Football Reference). The Cowboys, determined to mimic the Colts' ineptitude, had  
Recall the worst Super Bowl games before Super Bowl LVII.  The 45-point deficit remains the largest in Super Bowl history. Furthermore, the 55 total points are also the highest tally by any team. 
The Worst. 4. Super Bowl XLVIII: February 2, 2014, Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Seattle Seahawks 43, Denver Broncos 8 .  In the first Super Bowl rematch in history, Pittsburgh  
This Super Bowl took place in 1990 in the heart of Joe Montana and the 49ers’ reign of dominance in the NFL. The Niners took a 27-3 lead going into halftime against the 11-5 Broncos and did not relent, causing the Broncos to become the second team in league history to lose four Super Bowls.

Cast your votes below to rank the absolute worst, definitely NOT super, Super Bowls in football history. 
10. Super Bowl 50-Denver Broncos 24, Carolina Panthers 10. Yes, last year’s Super Bowl belongs on this list. Peyton Manning and Cam Newton combined to complete less than half of their passes (31  
This was only the second time in Super Bowl history both quarterbacks passed for at least 300 yards, and it ranked second in Super Bowl history in terms of total offensive yards produced. The 37 points in the fourth quarter were the most combined points in any quarter of a Super Bowl game, much less the decisive fourth quarter. 
The 36-point margin was the biggest in Super Bowl history to that point, with Chicago falling behind 3–0 before rattling off 44 consecutive points. All told, Chicago's famed "46" defense allowed  
The Colts made seven turnovers, the most ever by a Super Bowl champion, and the Cowboys set a Super Bowl record with 10 penalties, costing them 133 yards. At least the game’s result went down to the final seconds, as it was settled by a game-winning 32-yard field goal by Colts rookie kicker Jim O’Brien with five seconds left in regulation time. 
Super Bowl XXIV (Jan. 28, 1990) San Francisco 49ers 55, Denver Broncos 10

The Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams met for Super Bowl LVI, the most recent Lombardi Trophy battle, at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.

(having finally been  
Except for the 1972 Dolphins, every Super Bowl champion has endured a loss. Several have needed to recover from a one-sided defeat, while many champs had a chance to avenge their worst loss in the  
Here's a glimpse at the history of national anthem at the Super Bowl, including the best and worst performances all time, plus a complete list of every singer from 1967 to 2024. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest annual social sporting event of the calendar year. With so much on the line, everything that these players and coaches do will be scrutinized even more closely than  
The Super Bowl is the most anticipated sporting event of the year, but it doesn't always live up to the hype. Here are the worst Super Bowl games in history. Why It Was Bad: This was one of the
