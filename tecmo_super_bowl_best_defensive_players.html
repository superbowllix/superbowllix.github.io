But in terms of Tecmo Bowl and video game lore, Warren Moon is an an IMMORTAL LEGEND. ***** 15. Deion Sanders. Deion Sanders was so fast in Tecmo Super Bowl, he might as well have been playing defensive end because, unlike real life, he could actually stop the run too. That’s why they call them VIDEO GAMES. 
I assume offensive players have been done, and defensive players for NES has been also, or will be taken care of, but what do you got? Prime, Hot Rod, R. White, B. Smith, Cortez Kennedy. Buffalo's safeties (Kelso and the other's name escapes me). Someone from ATL (not Prime) was also underrated I 
Few video games have had the longevity of 1991’s Tecmo Super Bowl. The sequel to the equally popular “Tecmo Bowl,” it was one of the first video games to feature every NFL team (there were 30 at the time), real players and the ability to both keep stats and play an entire season complete with playoffs.

Top Kick Returners &gt; Craig Heyward RB1 #34; Merril Hoge RB1 #33; Warren Williams RB2 #42; Tim Worley RB3 #38; Richard Bell RB4 #21 
Here are the five most dominant players ever to put on a helmet in "Tecmo Super Bowl." Bo Jackson: Bo knows video games, and how to run circles around defenders on the field -- literally. 
Their defense is one of, if not the best, very comparable to New York and Buffalo. Mike Singletary can easily run right through any offensive line and complete a sack. Richard Dent is great on defense and can get a sack if Singletary doesn’t. Their defensive backs, Donnell Woolford and Mark Carrier, always seem to intercept most passes. 
The most significant thing here is that every defensive player has a higher top speed than every offensive player. A defensive player with 6 MS is slightly faster than an offensive player with 100 MS and the same RS/RP. Because of all this, MS is far more important on offense than on defense. On offense, it's really the only significant speed

ALSO, defensive players have a speed boost built into the game which means that while they may have a lower MS than an offensive player, they could still potentially catch them. Hitting Power (HP) - unlike many other variations of Tecmo Super Bowl, in TSB3 Hitting Power has meaning; and that meaning is significant. HP is a players ability to  
I have only played the original Tecmo Super Bowl game. Is III based off the '94 players with the '95 team schedule? Yeah that was the season that the Niners were trying to build a team through free agency that could beat Dallas and the Cowboys were starting to lose some of their depth through free agency (and players like Ken Norton signed with  
Read the playbook. Know how the plays work. Formation, whether it's a run or pass. Then during that brief time after you've selected what defense to play, read your opponents formation for a pass or run. 
It might not be 100% accurate based on player preference, but it's good enough. Each position page is sorted from best to worst in the game. This is a bare bones version of my TSB3 excel file changed for TSB. There are some changes I want to make for defensive player positions (listing LB1-4 instead of just LB) and things like that 
Yeah I did, too, at first. But really look at their defense. Fulcher is a superstar and I gave him 125 points, higher than any other player in the game except Jerry Rice, and Francis is slightly above average (a lot of guys have at least 31 RS and 44 RP), but other than that it sucks. 
I'm curious which positions on the field for defense people find to be better than others.Is FS better than SS? LB4 better than 3,2 or 1? DE/NT?If you aren't taking specific players into consideration. What are the pros and cons of each spot on the field and in what order would you rank them? 
(1 JOHNNY JOHNSON ~can play ANY position on offense except QB, exceptionally well. The total packagecan be used in ANY situation on offensecan score from anywhere on the fieldNUFSAID.(2 Randall Cunningham ~If you know how to use this guy to his full potentialpossibility's are limitles 
am aware of the cornerback topic, but need an all-around db topic for an upcoming draft. temco decided to jumble the ratings in such a way that its a relatively tough decision to pick the sure best db. most will say its fulcher. but is the hitting power worth the drops in ms and int from haddix? is woodson's extra ms worth the drop in int and  
Across the board, the Bears have the most elite defenders of any team in Tecmo Bowl. Chicago has lots of team defense speed, but New York has speed at more crucial positions than Chicago. Despite that, Da Bears are known as a fierce defensive team. Top defensive end, &amp; top defensive back Richard Dent &amp; Dave Duerson are key players for this defense. 
Who's your favorite D player? How about in excellent? And what reasons are they your fave? </p>
