ESPN staff Feb 5, 2025, 10:30 AM ET. Email;  More than 60 experts picked the winner of Eagles-Chiefs, including the final score of the game and who they think will win Super Bowl MVP.

Saquon Barkley is the rare non-quarterback to be a top-two Super Bowl MVP favorite ahead of this year’s big game between the Eagles and Chiefs, coming in with the second-best odds (+240) to win  
The Super Bowl MVP has also been an offensive award; just nine of the 58 winners were defensive players. Von Miller is the last non-offensive player to receive the honor, doing so with the Denver  
BetMGM took a $25,000 wager on Travis Kelce to win the MVP at 15-1 odds, so he is a bad outcome for BetMGM. “Funny enough, both kickers are our biggest liability,” Cipollini noted. 
Despite the Chiefs being the current favorites to win the big game and Mahomes to take home another Super Bowl MVP, Barkley has the highest percentage of bets -- 22 percent -- on BetMGM sportsbook  
The right play here is Patrick Mahomes at +110 for Super Bowl MVP. If you missed betting on the Chiefs at better odds earlier, Mahomes offers solid value. Quarterbacks are heavily favored in MVP races, and unless there’s a standout defensive performance like Von Miller’s Super Bowl MVP, it is almost always going to the leader of the team. 
Desmond Howard was Super Bowl XXXI MVP as a kick returner. Five WRs have won the award since 2005. Two linebackers also lifted the MVP trophy since 2014 (Malcom Smith, Von Miller). Only one defensive player has won NFL regular-season MVP, but ten defensive players have won Super Bowl MVP. Super Bowl MVP Pick: Patrick Mahomes (+110) 
The Super Bowl MVP 2025 odds have been set with the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles squaring off on Sunday, Feb. 9. Unsurprisingly, Patrick Mahomes is the betting favorite to take home the award, a feat he accomplished in the previous three Kansas City Super Bowl wins. 
Mahomes and Barkley remain the odds-on favorites to win Super Bowl MVP, with implied win probabilities of 45.5 percent and 27.8 percent, respectively.  Super Bowl MVP 2025: Best bet
