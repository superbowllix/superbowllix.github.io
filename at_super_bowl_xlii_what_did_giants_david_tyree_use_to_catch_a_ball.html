        <h2><strong>at super bowl xlii what did giants david tyree use to catch a ball lady gaga super bowl performances</strong></h2>
        <p>The Helmet Catch was an American football play involving New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning and wide receiver David Tyree in the final two minutes of Super Bowl XLII on February 3, 2008. It featured Manning narrowly escaping a sack from three New England Patriots defensive players and throwing a forward pass , followed by Tyree making a  
Exactly 17 years ago today, Giants wideout David Tyree made one of the greatest catches in NFL history, and it led to New York's upset win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Let's  
On Feb. 3, 2008, an improbable catch by an unlikely hero keyed one of the great upsets in NFL history. With 1:15 left in Super Bowl XLII, the Tom Brady-led Patriots led the Giants, 14-10, and were  
New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning launches a deep pass over the middle to wide receiver David Tyree, who makes a leaping catch that he pins against his helmet. 
The Giants were down 14-10 with 1:15 remaining in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XLII against the undefeated New England Patriots. Faced with a third-and-five on their own 44-yard line, Manning escaped the grasp of Patriots defensive ends Richard Seymour and Jarvis Green and was able to stay on his feet as he scrambled backwards to find some space. 
David Tyree had made only four catches all season, so making perhaps the biggest catch in Super Bowl history would seem like a miracle. And it was. Flash back to early February and Phoenix Stadium. Super Bowl XLII was all about the 18-0 New England Patriots and how they would be remembered as possibly the NFL’s greatest team ever. 
The Giants' win in Super Bowl XLII remains a defining moment in NFL history. Tyree's catch is frequently discussed in conversations about the greatest plays in Super Bowl history. What's Next. Looking ahead, the legacy of this game continues to shape narratives around Super Bowl upsets and the importance of clutch performances in high-stakes  
Tyree's incredible reception wasn't the only play from the Giants to make the NFL's Top 100 in Super Bowl history. In fact, it wasn't even the only play from that same game to crack the top 100. Plaxico Burress's 13-yard game-winning touchdown grab just four plays after Tyree's catch ranked No. 11 on the all-time list. 
Re-live one of the greatest moments in Super Bowl history through the perspectives of New York Giants head coach Tom Coughlin, former wide receiver David Tyree and former NFL referee Mike Carey 
Brady himself was entering his fourth appearance in the Big Game. He won the first three, against the Rams, Panthers, and Eagles, and was already heading towards a historic status of a future Hall of Famer. Little did the NFL know he had even more left in the tank. But Super Bowl XLII wasn’t what he had hoped for in the chase for a fourth ring.

Watch David Tyree's catch to set up the game winning touchdown in Super Bowl XLII 
The greatest play in Super Bowl history had just set the stage for the greatest upset in Super Bowl history. After the Giants completed a long third-down play on the next set of downs, Manning found wide receiver Plaxico Burress in the end zone for a go-ahead touchdown that gave the Giants a 17-14 advantage with 35 seconds left on the clock.

Any week the Patriots and Giants meet, we have to look back on one of the best plays in Super Bowl history David Tyree's "Helmet Catch" 
Super Bowl XLII MVP Eli Manning engineered a fourth quarter comeback drive for the ages and concluded perhaps the greatest postseason run in NFL history as t 
The Super Bowl returns to Glendale for the first time since 2008, when David Tyree entered NFL lore with The Helmet Catch. He’s not in Arizona this week, but the former Giants wideout relives  
After a 10-6 regular season, he led the Giants to playoff triumphs at Tampa Bay, at Dallas and at Green Bay (the latter two teams had handily defeated the Giants early in the season) before an epic 17-14 victory in Super Bowl XLII against a New England Patriots team that entered the game 18-0, including a victory over the Giants in the regular  
David Tyree, a former wide receiver for the New York Giants, is best known for his iconic "Helmet Catch" in Super Bowl XLII, which not only secured a place for him in football history but also changed the trajectory of the NFL and the careers of those involved. Together with Fan Arch, let's dive into the life, career, 
David Tyree singlehandedly prevented the Patriots from achieving a perfect season. His miraculous helmet catch against New England in Super Bowl XLII will forever be etched in NFL history.
