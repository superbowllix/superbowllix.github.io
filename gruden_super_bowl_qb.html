        <p>Super Bowl XXXVII was an  "Gruden's new team", made their first Super Bowl appearance in  Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon threw a Super Bowl record five  
Gruden was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002, which he led to their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVII the same season. At age 39, he was the then-youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl. He served as Tampa Bay's head coach through 2008, setting the franchise record for wins, but made only two further playoff runs. 
While Gruden's offense took time to develop, quarterback Brad Johnson enjoyed a breakthrough performance in Week 9, throwing five touchdowns in a 38-24 win over the Vikings. 
Oakland Raiders 21 vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48 on January 26th, 2003 - Full team and player stats and box score 
The Buccaneers went on to rout Gruden's former team, the Oakland Raiders, by a score of 48–21 in Super Bowl XXXVII. Gruden's familiarity with the Raiders’ players and playbook paid off, as John Lynch and other Buccaneer players recognized some of Oakland's formations and plays at crucial points in the game. [ 17 ] 
Coach: Jon Gruden (12-4-0) Points For: 346 (21.6/g) 18th of 32. Points Against: 196 (12.3/g) 1st of 32. Expected W-L: 12.7-3.3. SRS: 8.80 (2nd of 32), SOS: -0.57 Playoffs: Won Divisional Round 31-6 vs. San Francisco 49ers Won Conference Championship 27-10 vs. Philadelphia Eagles Won Super Bowl 48-21 vs. Oakland Raiders. Offensive Coordinator  
Having led the Bucs to victory in their first Super Bowl appearance, Gruden will focus on bolstering his offense--a shaky start on Sunday by quarterback Brad Johnson (18 of 34, 215 yards, two touchdowns, one interception) was offset by the surprising success of running back Michael Pittman (29 carries, 124 
This became the major talking point of the game as Gruden’s “new team” faced off against his “old team”. The game was nicknamed the “Gruden Bowl” due to this major storyline. Both teams dominated their conferences during the regular season in their quest to the Super Bowl. Tampa Bay made their first Super Bowl appearance with a  
Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2003 Super Bowl team head coach Jon Gruden runs onto the field in 2012 clutching the Lombardi Trophy as he and his former team are introduced during the half time show as Bucs  
Jon Gruden (born August 17, 1963, Sandusky, Ohio, U.S.) is an American gridiron football coach and television broadcaster who led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a Super Bowl championship in 2003. Gruden was raised around football: his father, Jim, was an assistant coach at Indiana University (1973–77) and at the University of Notre Dame (1978–80). 
Defense won that Super Bowl, and Gruden had nothing to do with that defense. Put that defensive performance on the 2001 team, and, yes, they're likely winning again. Gruden's knowledge of the Raiders' playbook obviously made that Super Bowl a laugher, but the Bucs steamrolled their way through the playoffs without knowing that. 
At the time, aged 39, Gruden became the youngest coach to lift the Lombardi Trophy and both Gruden and the Buccaneers became Super Bowl champions for the first time. Expand Tweet 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will compete in Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Ever since the matchup was set, there has been a steady flow of  
He was injured in Week 1 and the team turned to Brian Griese, one of Gruden’s QBs from 2004-2005, but he also had back-to-back three interception games under Gruden. 
Gruden is, of course, referring to the Eagles’ first trip to the Super Bowl 45 years ago. In that game, which was played in New Orleans like Super Bowl 59, Philly QB Ron Jaworski threw three picks and lost a fumble as they were dominated 27-10 by the Raiders. Gruden thinks history is going to repeat itself to an extent. 
Bucs quarterback Brad Johnson:  Glazer: “Every team has only one goal each year and that’s to win the Super Bowl. Jon Gruden is the reason I am wearing this [Super Bowl] ring. It’s also  
Gruden piloted Tampa Bay to its first-ever Super Bowl in 2002, his first season as head coach of the Buccaneers. The team established a franchise record with 12 wins and Gruden became just the third coach since 1966 to win 40 games before his 40th birthday while also becoming only the third head coach in NFL history to lead a different team to a playoff appearance in consecutive years. 
Gruden previously hadn't been mentioned as a potential assistant under Kellen Moore, who reportedly is expected to be hired as the Saints' new head coach after Super Bowl LIX. 
Gruden's Super Bowl victory with the Buccaneers remains a highlight of his career. His work as a broadcaster brought a new level of insight and enthusiasm to football analysis. Gruden's "QB Camp" helped shape the careers of many young quarterbacks entering the NFL. 
Gruden captioned the video with his trademark tagline "feelin' really NICEY". Joining Gruden in Tampa at practice was three-time Super Bowl champion and current Tampa Bay Bucs head coach Todd  </p>
