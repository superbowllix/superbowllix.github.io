        <p>The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to date. 
What Has More Viewers: Super Bowl or Champions League Final? Champions League final vs. Super Bowl viewership reaches into the hundreds of millions, easily, for both games! Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, which ended as a 25-22 overtime win for the Chiefs, was the most-watched telecast in US history. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
UEFA Champions League Final – 450 Million Viewers; Super Bowl – 115.1 Million Viewers; Wimbledon – 25.6 Million Viewers; NBA Finals – 17.8 Million Viewers; World Cup of Rugby- 17 Million Viewers; Kentucky Derby – 16.6 Million Viewers; The Masters – 15 Million Viewers; World Series – 14.73 Million Viewers; NCAA Final Four – 14.7  
The Champions League final has generally averaged around 400 million viewers for the last five years with the 2021 Champions League Final between Chelsea and Manchester City being the most viewed event in the competition’s history with around 700 million viewers. Super Bowl, on the other hand, had failed to break the 100-million mark for the  
The Super Bowl stands as a cultural phenomenon in the United States, while the Champions League final is established as a spectacle of truly global reach. Both events demonstrate the power of sport to bring together people from different cultures and nationalities, albeit with distinct focuses and geographical scopes. 
A total audience of 123.4m average viewers tuned in across their platforms and just over 200m watched all or some of the Super Bowl. For the Champions League final to get on the same level as the  
Moreover, the Champions League final is widely reported to generate 700 million viewers while, according to FC Business, a recent El Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid attracted 650 million  
However, there’s another annual sporting event that competes with the Champions League Final in terms of popularity and revenue: the US’s Super Bowl Sunday, which concludes the NFL season. Back in 2015, the Super Bowl brought in 114 million viewers compared to the Champions League Final’s 380 million, according to Infographics. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
Its like the World Cup for Americans essentially, ton of casual viewers who just want to be involved in the festivities. Champions League is nothing like this, there is no commercials or halftime show hoopla, very few women watch and Champions League Final parties with children and wifes making themed snacks aren't common. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
The Champions League has also now incorporated a Super Bowl-esque showbiz element with on-field musical performances before kick-off. So, while the Super Bowl is, and likely will always be, the king of US sports, the wider sporting world pays much more attention to the Champions League final. Super Bowl vs Champions League final: Who wins? 
The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
Instead of the World Cup final, a fairer comparison would be to set the Super Bowl against the UEFA Champions League final. It’s by far the biggest game of the club soccer calendar. 
The Super Bowl versus the FIFA World Cup: two colossal events that captivate the globe, each with its own fervent following. In this video, we dive deep into 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
The 2021 Champions League final brought in 700 million viewers compared to the 2022 Super Bowl’s 112 million. Al-Khelaifi highlighted that the U.S. and Super Bowl have a mindset of “ creativity and entertainment ” when it comes to the event and suggested the Champions League do the same. </p>
