The Chicago Bears last won the Super Bowl in the 1985 season. The Bears beat the New England Patriots 46-10 in the Super Bowl. When was the last time the Chicago Bears lost the Super Bowl? The Chicago Bears last lost the Super Bowl in the 2006 season. 
XII: Seven starters on the 1985 Super Bowl championship team were selected by the Bears in the 1983 NFL Draft: Tackle Jimbo Covert and receiver Willie Gault in the first round, cornerback Mike Richardson in the second, safety Dave Duerson in the third, guard Tom Thayer in the fourth, and defensive end Richard Dent and guard Mark Bortz in the  
Super Bowl XLI, played on Feb. 4, 2007, pitted the Bears against the Indianapolis Colts. Hester, who is widely regarded as the best kick returner of all time, returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown. It marked the first time that this happened in Super Bowl history, and it has yet to happen since. Of course Devin Hester took the opening  
On January 26, 1986, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Chicago Bears score a Super Bowl record number of points to defeat the New England Patriots, 46-10, and win their first championship since 1963.

Having played with the Bears from 1984-87, Marshall is one of the NFL's rare players, winning Super Bowl rings with two teams ('85 Bears and '91 Washington Redskins).

Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson is receiving much of the national focus for the opening in Chicago. 
Hester's touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did this went on to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in  
On Jan. 26, 1986, the Bears defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, capping one of the greatest seasons in NFL history. On the 35th anniversary, we look at some of the players on that team then and find out what they've been up to since becoming world cha 
While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s  
This would be a great hire for the Chicago Bears. They need a proven head coach who has a pedigree of winning. Pete Carroll has shown he can win at all levels. He is one of four coaches to win a national championship and a Super Bowl (Barry Switzer, Jimmy Johnson, and Jim Harbaugh). The Bears have a big decision to make. 
Here are the Bears starters from Super Bowl XX against the New England Patriots on Jan. 26, 1986 at the Louisiana Superdome. 
The Chicago Bears have been around for over 100 years and have naturally collected a number of titles in that extended timeframe. However, most of their success came from before the the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, meaning the Bears' Super Bowl story is a relatively short one given their trophycase.

Virginia Halas McCaskey, the principal owner and matriarch of the Chicago Bears, died Thursday at the age of 102, the team announced. The final game she watched was the Bears’ 24 to 22 last  </p>
