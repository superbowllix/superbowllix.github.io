        <h2><strong>super bowl rings manning brothers super bowl 2025 champions</strong></h2>
        <p>Both the Manning brothers are Super Bowl champions. Peyton Manning made four Super Bowl appearances. He had two with the Indianapolis Colts (2007, 2010) and two with the Denver Broncos (2014, 2016). 
The second Manning Bowl was held on September 19, 2010, with Peyton and the Colts beating Eli's Giants again by a score of 38–14. [12] The third and final Manning Bowl was held on September 15, 2013, and Peyton and the Broncos beat Eli's Giants 41–23. [13] They faced each other in two Pro Bowls, in 2009 and 2013, both won by the NFC. [14] 
Eli Manning and his brother, Peyton Manning, are two of the most successful siblings in NFL history. The only blood brothers in the NFL who’ve also won multiple Super Bowl rings . Eli played football professionally for 16 seasons and bowed out of the NFL on January 22, 2020. 
Although Peyton Manning has had a far better career in the NFL than younger brother Eli, when it comes to Super Bowl victories, both brothers have won 2 rings each. Q. Who was the first Manning to  
After getting drafted No. 1 overall by the San Diego Chargers, Eli Manning forced his way out of town and was traded to the New York Giants for Philip Rivers where he would go on to win two Super Bowl rings. The young brother of Peyton Manning, Eli went to Ole Miss and played for the Giants throughout his entire career from 2004 to 2019. 
Manning retired in 2019 as one of the Giants’ most decorated players of all time and now does broadcasting work alongside his brother, Peyton. Peyton Manning is also a two-time Super Bowl  
Eli Manning, QB As part of a group, which included ownership, coach Tom Coughlin, receiver Amani Toomer and offensive lineman Shaun O'Hara, Super Bowl XLII MVP Eli Manning helped design the ring  
The 12-­play, 83-­yard drive earned Eli the game’s MVP — one year after his older brother Peyton won his first Super Bowl and was MVP. QUOTE OF NOTE: “We tried to raise kids just like other parents raised their kids. I can’t explain it.” — Archie Manning on raising two Super Bowl MVP’s MVP: Eli Manning (19­34, 255 yards, 1TD, 1  
The Giants won Super Bowl 42 over the Patriots during the 2007-08 season, and they also won Super Bowl 46 over the Patriots during the 2011-12 season with Manning under center. 
Both Manning brothers topped out at over $30 million.  Moving over to the Kelces, Jason has one Super Bowl ring, seven First-Team All-Pro honors and seven Pro Bowl appearances. Travis has  
In short, the Manning brothers found their place in the NFL and made the most of it. Peyton Manning had the best quarterback season of all time in 2013 when he threw for a record 5,477 yards and 55 touchdowns. Eli Manning was one of the grittiest players in the league, and he turned up every single season for the Giants. 
Peyton Manning won both Super Bowl XLI (2007) and 50 (2016) and was the Super Bowl MVP in the former. Eli Manning won Super Bowls XLII (2008) and XLVI (2012) and was the Super Bowl MVP both times. 
Peyton Manning, who has had an illustrious 18-year career in the National Football League (NFL), has two Super Bowl wins to his name - Super Bowl XLI (2006) &amp; Super Bowl 50 (2015). 
EDGE, ELI (3-2): I know Eli has two Super Bowl rings to Peyton's one, so I can understand the votes for the younger Manning, but I still would take Peyton if I needed to win a playoff game. He's  
Here’s the list of Manning’s Super Bowl wins - Wins: XLII: New York Giants 17-14 New England Patriots (2008) XLVI: New York Giants 21-17 New England Patriots (2012) 
Manning’s next Super Bowl came after he was with the Colts. This time, he was with the Broncos. At the time, Manning was the only starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl with multiple teams. Today, he and Tom Brady are the only ones to do so. Again, the Manning-led team won this game handily, beating the Panthers 24-10. 
Manning made it to the Super Bowl in 2010 and 2014, but his teams weren’t able to claim the championship title. The first Super Bowl that Manning played in was Super Bowl XL in 2006, where he led the Colts to victory against the Chicago Bears. 
Peyton and Eli Manning go head-to-head in a hilarious new FanDuel ad ahead of Super Bowl LIX. After years of rivalry, the iconic brothers compete in the "Kic 
Cooper Manning, the older brother of Peyton (above, right) and Eli Manning (above, left), made a rare public statement recently. “I’d have four Super Bowl rings by now,” Cooper Manning said 
The mark that Manning left on the NFL is unquestionable: In addition to those two Super Bowl rings, he was also inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2021 and still holds three records: most touchdown  </p>
