        <h2><strong>super bowl xl terrible towel super bowl ring on sale</strong></h2>
        <p>After the Steelers won Super Bowl XL in 2005, a Towel with the words "Super Bowl XL Champions", the date, final score, and Super Bowl XL logo was released. [16] The victory also spawned the production of a Towel featuring the logos of the six Super Bowls that the franchise has won. [ 17 ] 
For Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. 
The Steelers had just stolen Super Bowl XL from the Seahawks with the help of some shockingly one-sided officiating.  Terrible Towels waved everywhere.

The towels are a swirling reminder of her father, Myron Cope, a longtime Pittsburgh broadcaster credited with creating the Terrible Towel in 1975.

Following Super Bowl XL the Steelers presented the school with a check for $1 million, which just represented sales from that season. Steelers' players love seeing the towel waving, love the enthusiasm and energy it brings as it fires them up as much as it fires up the fans. 
Just ask Bengals receiver T.J. Houshmandazdeh, who shined his cleats with the Terrible Towel following a late-season victory at Heinz Field in 2005. The Bengals, winners of the AFC North, lost to Pittsburgh in the wildcard round. The Steelers went on to win Super Bowl XL. 
Hockey saw rally towels take off after Vancouver Canucks head coach Roger Neilson waved a white towel at the refs as if to say “I surrender” out of frustration; fans took to waving towels in solidarity after that.
