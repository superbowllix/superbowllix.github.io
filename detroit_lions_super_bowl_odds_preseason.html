The sportsbook at BetMGM has a few season prop bets for the Detroit Lions on the board.

An early Super Bowl prediction. I had the Lions winning the NFC and facing the Kansas City Chiefs in my preseason Super Bowl prediction, and I don’t see much reason to change that now. The Lions are the best team in the NFC and they have the best non-weather-related homefield advantage in all of football. 
When Was the Last Time the Detroit Lions Won the Super Bowl? The Lions are the only team in the NFC to have never reached the Super Bowl. In fact, the 2023-24 season marked the first time they captured a playoff win since 1991.
