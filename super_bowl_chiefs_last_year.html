        <p>The Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl last year, claiming a 25-22 overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. 
The Chiefs would also become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls if they can defat the Eagles. Last year, the Chiefs became the first team in 19 years to successfully defend their title. 
Kansas City has won four Super Bowls in its 65-year history, including two straight ahead of Super Bowl 59. The Chiefs will go for a historic three-peat against the Eagles. 
The Chiefs' most recent trip to the Super Bowl was in 2025. They downed the Bills, 32-29 in the AFC championship to advance to their third-straight Super Bowl and fifth in the past six years.

Sunday’s win had a similar vibe to the 2020 Super Bowl when the Chiefs staged a dramatic rally to stun San Francisco. All three of the Chiefs' recent Super Bowl wins came after being down 10 points. 
The Kansas City Chiefs are back in the Super Bowl for the fourth time in the last five years and are seeking their third championship since 2019. Sunday’s game is a rematch between the Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, who also met in Super Bowl LIV four years ago, a 31-20 win by Kansas City. 
The Kansas City Chiefs are playing in the Super Bowl for the fifth time in the last six years. Here's a look at their history in the Big Game.
