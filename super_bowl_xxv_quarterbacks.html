Super Bowl LIX is the 10th Super Bowl rematch in NFL history, but just the fourth rematch with the same quarterbacks. In the three occasions it has happened so far, Troy Aikman triumphed twice  
Some quarterbacks have managed to win Super Bowls despite not being considered “elite” at the time. Their stories serve as inspiration, showing that any QB can become a Super Bowl-winning quarterback if they rise to the occasion. Jeff Hostetler (Giants) – Stepped in as a backup and led the Giants to victory in Super Bowl XXV. 
The Giants had their second Super Bowl win, 20-19. Hostetler had a Super Bowl victory after coming off the bench late in the season. Anderson had the MVP award; it was revealed that Thurman Thomas was going to be named MVP should Norwood have made that field goal. The Giants held the ball for over 40 minutes, a Super Bowl record. 
The other four that featured starting signal callers from the same state were Super Bowl XIX (Joe Montana/Dan Marino), Super Bowl XXV (Jeff Hostetler/Jim Kelly), Super Bowl LIII (Tom Brady/Jared Goff) and Super Bowl LVII (Patrick Mahomes/Jalen Hurts).

Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.
