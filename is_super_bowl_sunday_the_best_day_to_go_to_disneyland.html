        <p>It’s the idea that Super Bowl Sunday is one of the best days to go to Disneyland. “Everyone will be watching the game,” they’ll tell you. “There will be no lines!” On paper, the theory certainly sounds plausible. After all, over 100 million Americans watch the Super Bowl.

A theory that we’ve often heard is that one of the best days to go to Disneyland is on Super Bowl Sunday. Everyone’s at home watching the big game, right? Not so, according to insiders.

My wife and kids went to Disneyland on Super Bowl Sunday a few years ago (back when we were AP holders) to test this theory out and they said it was a lot less crowded than normal. Unsure if things have changed though. Also, another theory is Father’s Day isn’t as crowded either, I can confirm it isn’t as crowded that day. 
Pro-tip: Recently in a Disneyland Facebook Group one former CM revealed that one of the least crowded days at Disneyland is black Friday! Super Bowl Sunday. On Super Bowl Sunday, most people are watching the big game and Disneyland tends to have fewer crowds. 
It’s fine. We go pretty much every Super Bowl Sunday. It’s a perfectly fine day to go. Not busy, not slow, etc. It’s not as slow as everyone seems to think it always will be, it’s not crazy busy.

I had to change my visit to California this year from early May to “Super Bowl Weekend”. I know “Super Bowl Sunday” itself is probably not a good day to go to Disneyland, but since the L.A. Rams are in the “big game” this year, I was just wondering if that Saturday (which is actually “Groundhog Day” in 2019) would 
Each year after the Super Bowl, it is a tradition for the MVP of the winning team to say that they are going to Disneyland or Disney World and make an appearance as part of a celebratory parade the next day. Last year, the Super Bowl parade was held at Disneyland featuring MVP Patrick Mahomes after the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the San  
Super Bowl Sunday is wrapping up, and fans watching have grown to anticipate this phrase at the end of the game: “I'm going to Disneyland!” or “I'm going to Disney World!” The Disneyland Super Bowl Parade featured a celebration of the winner of Super Bowl LVIII after the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs faced off.

The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom.
