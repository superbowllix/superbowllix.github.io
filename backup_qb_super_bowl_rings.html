Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are the only starting quarterbacks to have won Super Bowls for two NFL teams, while Craig Morton and Kurt Warner are the only other quarterbacks to have started for a second team. Jim McMahon won a second Super Bowl ring having been a backup on the Brett Favre-led Green Bay Packers team that won Super Bowl XXXI.

Although Steve Young won three Super Bowl rings with the San Francisco 49ers, only one came as a starting quarterback. Initially, he was Joe Montana’s backup and earned his first two rings in  
Bradshaw wasn't asked to do much in Super Bowl IX, throwing for 96 yards and a score as the Steelers ran for 249 yards, led by MVP Franco Harris' then Super Bowl record 158 yards. • Jim Plunkett  
For a QB that was truly a backup (second string), that would be Earl Morrall who was second string for the 1970 Baltimore Colts that won Super Bowl V and the 1972 and 1973 Miami Dolphins who won Super Bowls VII and VIII. Morrall started 11 games (9 regular season, 2 playoff) in the 1972 season when Bob Griese went down with leg and ankle injuries but went back to second string when Griese was  
The Dallas Cowboys had a quarterback controversy in 1971. Head coach Tom Landry was giving playing time to both Craig Morton, who led the team to Super Bowl V the year prior, and Roger Staubach, a  
Perhaps one of the most unheralded Super Bowl winning quarterbacks in recent memory, Trent Dilfer was once a solid QB and not just an analyst on ESPN. Dilfer filled in for an injured Tony Banks, and was tasked with simply playing smart and letting that vaunted 2000 Baltimore Ravens defense do the dirty work. 
The backup quarterback is the most popular person on the team. Unless, of course, the starter is Tom Brady.  Huard won two Super Bowl rings as Brady's backup and parlayed that into another

Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
8 Derek Loville . Derek Loville is a running back who has won 3 Super Bowls, and if you have not heard of him before, no one would blame you. When the 49ers won it all in 1995, Loville was the third-string running back, and as a result, he never made it onto the field, and the Broncos gave him 2 more rings, even though he recorded just 6 TDs over 4 seasons with them. 
Many were quick to write off the Houston Texans once rookie T.J. Yates took over for injured quarterbacks Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart. But the Texans are 2-0 with Yates as the starter, and a last  
Gabbert has continued landing several backup roles in the NFL, with his two most recent stops resulting in Super Bowl victories. Gabbert backed up Tom Brady in Tampa from 2020-2022, then Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City in 2023. 
He will always be the 1st quarterback to win a Super Bowl with 2 different franchises, a fitting record for the only quarterback to go to 4 Super Bowls with 4 different head coaches too. Manning’s playoff legacy is often criticized for his 14-13 record and 9 one-and-done postseasons, but when his team got past the opening game, he was 14-4  
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins.

Flacco and Foles are backups. Wilson's future got off to an ugly start. Meanwhile, Mahomes only needs one more Super Bowl win to be one of the all time top five for most SB wins, and he's only 27 years old! It'll be very exciting to see which of the rising stars at QB win a ring in years to come. Allen? Burrow? Herbert? Hurts? </p>
