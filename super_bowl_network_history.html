        <p>Therefore, CBS benefited from holding rights to the Super Bowl and the 2021 NCAA Final Four, while NBC paired its Super Bowl coverage with the 2022 Winter Olympics. [10] [12] Under the four-network rotation starting in 2024, the league awarded NBC or any network that airs the Winter Olympics the Super Bowl during Winter Olympic years. [3] [11  
The network that televises the Super Bowl is determined by TV contracts that get negotiated by the NFL every 4-8 years. In recent years, it has been Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth teaming up with NBC, Jim Nantz and Tony Romo calling for CBS, and Joe Buck and Troy Aikman handling the duties for FOX – though FOX has recently experimented  
^Note 1 : Super Bowl I was simulcast on both CBS (at the time the sole NFL network) and NBC (the AFL network). From Super Bowl II onward, the networks began rotating exclusive coverage of the game on an annual basis. Super Bowls I–VI were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, due to league restrictions then in place. 
Here’s a brief history of the Super Bowl on TV. The AFL-NFL World Championship Game Simulcast In 1967, NBC and CBS simulcast the first Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Green Bay  
The Patriots' 33 points were the highest losing score in Super Bowl history, a record held until 2023, when the Eagles lost Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 38–35. [123] It was the Eagles' third Super Bowl appearance and their first win in franchise history. 
Super Bowl, in U.S. professional gridiron football, the championship game of the National Football league, played by the winners of the league’s American Football Conference and National Football Conference each January or February. The game is hosted by a different city each year. 
Miami holds the record for the most Super Bowl games with 11. However, New Orleans is set to equal that mark as the site of Super Bowl 59 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles . 
The Super Bowl is an enormously popular sporting event that takes place each year to determine the championship team of the National Football League (NFL). Broadcast in more than 170 countries  
[112] [113] Meanwhile, Super Bowl LI on Fox in 2017 remains [citation needed] the most watched telecast on peak conclusion in U.S. history, drawing 172 million viewers (more than half of the U.S. population of 340 million that same year) in the league's first overtime period ever for a Super Bowl. 
The Super Bowl returned to NBC after an 11-year break with the network broadcasting a memorable game between the Steelers and Arizona Cardinals in Tampa, Florida.

Super Bowl Wins by the Eagles. While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
This will be the 58th iteration of the Super Bowl as the NFC and AFC Champions will battle. Super Bowl 58 will kick off from Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, is set for 6:30 p.m. ET and will air on CBS. With 57 Super Bowls in the books, let’s take a look at which conference has fared better in football’s biggest game. Super Bowl history

20. Another network didn’t broadcast the Super Bowl until 1985. On January 20, 1985, ABC broke the long-standing grip of NBC and CBS on Super Bowl television broadcasts. The network had been airing professional football on its Monday Night Football broadcasts for fifteen years before it had the opportunity to do the Super Bowl. Frank Gifford  
The Green Bay Packers’ last Super Bowl appearance was in 2010, when they beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25 to win Super Bowl XLV. It was the pinnacle of Aaron Rodgers ’ career, which included four MVP awards and first-team All-Pro selections. 
The 49ers failed to get that sixth Super Bowl win that would have tied them with the Steelers for the most Super Bowls ever; they’d get another chance seven years later. Next time, we will have one of the weirdest routs in Super Bowl history, a game that brought the NFL back to the eighties, with the NFC dominating the AFC in brutal fashion. </p>
