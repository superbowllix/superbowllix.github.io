        <p>For Super Bowl LIV in 2020, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products was the official sponsor of that game's MVP ceremony; [15] Patrick Mahomes' announcement of the phrase was thus embedded into the broadcast post-game show, which included appearances by Mickey and Minnie Mouse alongside 10 year-old Make-a-Wish child Nathaniel from Austin, Texas. 
The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a parade at Walt Disney World was in 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade on Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. 
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. 
The first Super Bowl MVP to utter the now-iconic phrase was New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms, whose team defeated the Denver Broncos 39-20 in Super Bowl XXI in 1987. 
The Super Bowl Disney World trip is a decades-long NFL tradition. Since 1987, Super Bowl MVPs have been treated to a trip to "The Happiest Place on Earth. 
The beloved tradition dates back to Super Bowl XXI in 1987, according to Disney Parks Blog.As ESPN also reports, New York Giants quarterback and MVP Phil Simms was the first to shout the now  
One of the Super Bowl's most famous and long-established traditions has nothing do with football, let alone the NFL. Every year, the Super Bowl MVP proclaims "I'm going to Disney World!" to an  
After his 2019 Super Bowl win, his last with the New England Patriots, Brady and game MVP Julian Edelman appeared in the Walt Disney World parade the day after the game. 
Sometimes the Super Bowl’s standout performer offers a slight variation on the theme, saying they’re going to Walt Disney World. It comes across as an off-the-cuff moment in the celebratory hubbub after the NFL’s showpiece game has culminated, with confetti still falling and the hordes of players staff and media still flooding the field. 
The "I'm going to Disney!" tradition didn't start until Super Bowl 21 in 1987. Twice in history there was no Disney theme park celebration in Orlando or Anaheim for the winning Super Bowl team. 
The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom. 
I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information from the Disney playbook. I just spoke to an MVP of a Cast Member who confirmed that, at the time of this writing, no official announcement has been made about the Super Bowl parade. However, this Cast Member also told me that a Super Bowl parade generally occurs the day after the big  
This year, Super Bowl LIX will be held in New Orleans, and the winning MVP player will be headed to visit Disney World the day afterward. In this year's game, the Kansas City Chiefs face off with the Philidelphia Eagles. We will share everything you need to know about the 2025 Super Bowl parade at Disney World! 
However, with this year’s game in New Orleans, the pendulum seems poised to swing back to Walt Disney World in Florida. If the winning team does head to Walt Disney World, fans can expect a magical celebration on Main Street, U.S.A., featuring the Super Bowl MVP waving to crowds, perhaps joined by a few teammates. 
Walt Disney World Hosting Super Bowl LIX Parade. The parade will take place at Magic Kingdom as players from the winning team ride down Main Street USA. An exact time for the parade has not yet been announced. Super Bowl LIX features the Kansas City Chiefs vs the Philadelphia Eagles and it will air on Fox starting at 6:30pm ET on Sunday  
Super Bowl XL Co-MVP and Pittsburgh Steelers' Hines Ward waves to fans as he rides with Mickey Mouse in a celebratory parade at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Monday, Feb. 6, 2006. 
The 58th annual Super Bowl will be held on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Walt Disney World guests can watch the Super Bowl from the comfort of their in-room TVs or visit a variety of locations across Walt Disney World property, including many bars and lounges at Disney Springs and at Walt Disney World resorts. Stop by your resort  
Each year after the Super Bowl game, it has been a tradition for a player of the winning team (usually the MVP) to say that they going to Disneyland or Disney World, which is followed by their appearance soon after (often the next day) as part of a celebratory cavalcade. 
At this time, we still don't know if the winning team of this year's Super Bowl will be visiting Walt Disney World or Disneyland for the parade of MVPs. With last year's game taking place in Las Vegas, the winning team went to nearby Disneyland for their parade , so it is possible that this year's parade will take place at Magic Kingdom since  
Patrick Mahomes fulfilled a high school dream when he was able to say, "I'm going to Disney World," after winning Super Bowl MVP. In an interview with ESPN on Monday at the theme park, he called  </p>
