The Eagles were a relative staple in the playoffs in the 2000s, but the Super Bowl win after the 2017 season gave the City of Brotherly Love its first title in team history. Pittsburgh Steelers 6-2. Their towels might be terrible, but the Steelers’ Super Bowl win/loss record certainly isn’t.

Unfortunately for Bills fans, the team also lost a record four consecutive Super Bowls in that span. All four losses were tough for the Bills, but the toughest may have been the first, Super Bowl XXV, which holds the record for smallest margin of victory in a Super Bowl with New York Giants defeating Buffalo by only one point, 20–19.
