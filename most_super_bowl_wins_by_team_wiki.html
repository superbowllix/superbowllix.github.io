At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year.

Among the NFL's current 32 teams, 20 (11 NFC, nine AFC) have won a Super Bowl and 15 (eight AFC, seven NFC) hold multiple titles. The AFC's Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots have the most Super Bowl titles at six each. The Patriots also have the most Super Bowl appearances at 11. [1]

Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid became the 14th different coach with multiple Super Bowl rings when he won Super Bowl LVII in 2023. 
In January 2007, he was hired as the defensive coordinator for the New York Giants under head coach Tom Coughlin.
