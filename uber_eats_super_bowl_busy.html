        <p>If you’re in New York, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Houston, Orlando and other cities, we’ll be bringing our campaign and conspiracy theory to life with Martha Stewart’s Super Bowl Caesar’s Salad available exclusively in the Uber Eats app through Sunday, February 9. Make sure to order yours, as it comes in our limited-edition Super Bowl  
In the past week, Uber Eats has seeded the new work with stunts, teasers and related activity, even offering a Martha Super Bowl Caesar Salad in key national markets. More behind-the-scenes  
The actor teams up with buzzy stars, such as Martha Stewart, Charli xcx, Kevin Bacon and Greta Gerwig, in the food delivery app's 2025 Super Bowl commercial Matthew McConaughey is getting to the  
Uber Eats hopes that the story will continue to grow throughout future football seasons, per The Hollywood Reporter. The whole commercial will air on Sunday, Feb. 9, as the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles face off in the 2025 Super Bowl, according to People. 
To further drive home the evidence behind the NFL's goal to make fans' mouths water, Uber Eats cast of a wide range of popular personalities. Martha Stewart and Charli XCX make a cameo together toward the end of the commercial as Matthew McConaughey's team discusses this year's Super Bowl's food connections. Charli XCX chomps into a green apple  
The piles of buffalo wings Evans ate while filming Uber Eats' 2025 Super Bowl ad highlights a perhaps unexpected aspect of the "Hot Ones" host's life: He doesn't really order wings at restaurants. Evans likes to balance out the thousands of wings he eats for "Hot Ones" with lots of juices, salads, and cereal — but wings have a way of finding  
LOS ANGELES — Matthew McConaughey is ready to pitch America on his next big idea, a film about how football is a conspiracy to sell food, even if there's a skeptic in the room. "The character I play in this is a salesman," McConaughey, 55, explains to USA TODAY about his new Super Bowl commercial for Uber Eats. "You go through this sort of  
Uber Eats’ latest Super Bowl 2025 ad combines previously featured Matthew McConaughey and Charli XCX with Martha Stewart in a new segment that explores the conspiracy football was invented to  
While the Super Bowl can be busy for Uber Eats delivery drivers, the fact that people assume it’ll be busy can also work as a double-edged sword. If too many drivers are logged into the Uber Eats app, that means even if it’s busy, you might not receive as many orders. 
A teaser that dropped at the end of January featuring a self-deprecating David and Victoria Beckham made sure that Uber Eats’ star-studded Super Bowl ad would be this year’s most-anticipated  
As the final countdown to Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, begins, it’s clear that Matthew McConaughey stars in Uber Eats Super Bowl Ad 2025 with a mission: to tickle our funny bones while encouraging us to get even hungrier—and, of course, order from the Uber Eats app when cravings strike. 
The matchup has been set. The Eagles and the Chiefs. Like every year, millions will gather around their TV's to watch the most popular television event in the United States. Nearly 100 million people will watch the SuperBowl. Only the World Cup final draws more viewers worldwide, though US viewership falls well below the numbers  
As a part of a multi-faceted campaign, Uber's Super Bowl rollout includes selling a Stewart-created Caesar salad and McConaughey's infamous tuna salad, which he made headlines for late last year  
Four Walls co-founders Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day and Glenn Howerton have made a spoof of McConaughey’s Uber Eats ad for the 2025 Super Bowl. The 'It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia' stars  
Fast food and corporate places will stay open, but you might find some independent places closed early. - Wingstop turns off their third-party deliveries. This is probably so that they don't get too overwhelmed. - Looooong waits at the places that are open. Last year, Super Bowl Sunday was awful. I'll be taking that night off this year. 
Stupid question, I know, but the past couple weeks I've been going under the assumption that Super Bowl Sunday is gonna be good for orders, but knowing Uber, it just occurred to me that might not be the case. Market might be saturated with drivers, too - but I think it'll be worth a shot. 
Super Bowl LVIII Week Events Overview: There are several special events taking place throughout Las Vegas, between Monday, February 5 and Sunday, February 11. Due to special event requirements, road closures will be in effect along with designated rideshare zones to help provide safe and easy points for pickups and dropoffs near top destinations. 
Pho Super Bowl in Coquitlam is a Vietnamese restaurant that has garnered a customer rating of approximately 4.2. It offers a diverse menu featuring traditional dishes like various beef noodle soups, including a spicy beef option and a house special with rare steak and well-done brisket. 
Is Uber Busy During Super Bowl Sunday? Planning Ahead. Driving on Super Bowl Sunday can be really fun, and depending on where you live, there is a chance to see Super Bowl Uber surge. I have done it a couple of times, and each time thoroughly enjoyed ferrying around party goers. However, in order to maximize your revenue, you will need to plan  
There are 2 ways to place an order on Uber Eats: on the app or online using the Uber Eats website. After you’ve looked over the Busy Boy Sandwiches menu, simply choose the items you’d like to order and add them to your cart. Next, you’ll be able to review, place, and track your order. </p>
