The trophy received its official name ahead of Super Bowl V in 1971. It was named for legendary coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victory in the first two Super Bowls. 
While the Super Bowl trophy has been named after Lombardi, the AFC Championship trophy has been named in Hunt's honor. Fittingly, Hunt's team, the Chiefs, will vie to become the first team to win  
During his weekly appearance on the Let's Go podcast (h/t NFL.com's Kevin Patra), Belichick suggested the NFL should rename the Super Bowl trophy after Tom Brady. "Maybe they should name it the

The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine. [11] Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL. At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after the former NFL commissioner, to the Super Bowl MVP. [12] 
The final four played in the AFC and NFC championship games on January 26, and the winners made it into the Super Bowl. Kansas City advanced with a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC

At that time, the cup was called: 'World Professional Football Championship Trophy' but, as a recognition to this team, which dominated the old NFL before the Super Bowl era and also became the  
A new trophy has been crafted every year since Super Bowl I, made entirely of gleaming silver over the course of a painstaking four-month process at Tiffany’s workshop in Cumberland, Rhode Island.
