Super Bowl LVIII in February of 2024 was played under the NFL’s current playoff overtime rules. The 49ers won the toss, chose to receive and kicked a field goal on their first possession. The Chiefs then marched down the field and scored a touchdown on their first possession, to win the game.

It was the second Super Bowl to go into overtime — the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons in overtime in Super Bowl LI in 2017 — but it was the first with the revised postseason  
The NFL’s first Super Bowl in Las Vegas was a sloppy, mistake-filled affair that was mostly boring until the back-and-forth fourth quarter and OT. It was the second of 58 Super Bowls to be tied after regulation, and the first played under new overtime rules that ensured both teams got the ball.
