        <p>The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's  
The Super Bowl MVP trophy has been won by some of the biggest names in American football history. Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Bart Starr, Terry Bradshaw, and Patrick Mahomes are just a few of the past

Mahomes enters Super Bowl 59 tied with Joe Montana for the second-most Super Bowl MVPs at three apiece. The only other players to win the award multiple times are Terry Bradshaw (2), Eli Manning  
Being the Super Bowl MVP is a monumental honor, but what this player really receives is more than just glory. A physical trophy, a trip, and even million-dollar contracts await the chosen one  
The Super Bowl MVP winner gets the Pete Rozelle Trophy. Now, that might not be as exciting as the Lombardi Trophy, but it’s still a huge honor for most NFL players. The list of Super Bowl MVPs  
SPORT magazine handed out the prize up until 1989. Bart Starr won the Most Valuable Player award in the first pair of Super Bowls. The NFL has since given out the trophy annually starting from 1990. Cooper Kupp, a wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams, was named the most recent Super Bowl MVP winner after Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022. 
The NFL selects a panel of 16 writers and broadcasters who are covering the game to vote on Super Bowl MVP. Since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, the league has allowed fans to also vote for the game’s MVP, but the fan vote only counts for 20%, while the media panel represents 80%. Each media member votes for their top five players for Super Bowl MVP. 
The position with the second-most Super Bowl MVPs is wide receiver at eight. Here’s a full breakdown of Super Bowl MVP winners by position: Quarterback: 31. Wide receiver: 8. Running back: 7. Linebacker: 4. Defensive end: 2. Safety: 2. Cornerback: 1. Defensive tackle: 1. Returner: 1. List of Super Bowl MVPs. Super Bowl I: QB Bart Starr, Green  
Over the course of 57 Super Bowls, a defensive player has won the MVP award only 10 times. Here's a list of every Super Bowl MVP.

In one of the higher-scoring Super Bowls of all-time, Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 38-35 victory en route to his second Super Bowl and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player. Mahomes threw three touchdowns, including two in the fourth quarter while playing on an injured ankle, to lift the Chiefs from a 10-point halftime deficit. 
Besides obviously bragging rights, the winning team of the Super Bowl gets the Vince Lombardi trophy—named after the legendary football coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to

Winning a pro football game in February comes with a lot of perks. A place in sports history. A trip to Disney World. Tons of media attention. The Super Bowl MVP is as good as it gets. Everyone knows Joe Namath, Joe Montana, Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes. Yet there was an NFL Championship Game long before the Super Bowl ever became a big deal. 
Sometimes, Super Bowls aren't that interesting. Take Super Bowl LV, when the Tom Brady-led Tampa Bay Buccaneers steamrolled Kansas City, 31-9. Sure, the last three games were 3-point affairs, but  
10. Jordan Mailata, OT. Clearly, high-level football is played in the trenches, as Jordan Mailata is the fifth offensive lineman in our top 10 of the best players in Super Bowl 59. 
One of the doubts that prevails around the MVP is the number of prizes and bonuses that this Super Bowl hero gets, which we reveal below.. Related: Super Bowl 2025: date, time, halftime show and
