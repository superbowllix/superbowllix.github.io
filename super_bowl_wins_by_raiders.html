        <p>Oakland Raiders a (1, 0–1) Miami Orange Bowl: Miami, Florida [sb 3] 75,546: Jack Vest [9] [8] III  and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super Bowl  
The Raiders have won the Super Bowl three times — in 1977, 1981 and 1984. Additionally, the Raiders count the 1967 AFL championship as part of their history. When was the last Las Vegas Raiders Super Bowl win? 
Legendary Raiders Willie Brown, Art Shell, and Marcus Allen discuss the significance of their Super Bowl rings. "NFL 100 Greatest" ranks the top 100 teams in NFL history, and the 1980 Oakland  
Super Bowl champions by year. 1967 Super Bowl (1): Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 1968 Super Bowl (2): Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14 1969 Super Bowl (3): New York Jets 16  
The Las Vegas Raiders last lost the Super Bowl in the 2002 season. The Raiders (then Oakland Raiders) lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by a score of 48-21. 
They would go on to win 27–10, winning their second Super Bowl and becoming the first team to ever win the Super Bowl after getting into the playoffs as the wild card team. The Raiders' final campaign of their first run in Oakland of 1981 saw the team fall to a 7–9 record, failing to make the playoffs following their Super Bowl win. 
Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon was intercepted a Super Bowl-record five times to put the Raiders in a 34-3 hole. The Raiders cut the deficit to 34-21 with six minutes left before disaster struck. 
The Raiders’ second Super Bowl win was at the Super Bowl XV in 1981, where they faced the Philadelphia Eagles. The third Super Bowl win was the Super Bowl XVIII in 1984, against the Washington  
All-Time Playoffs: 45 Games, 25-20 Wild Card Round: 8 Games, 4-4 Divisional Round: 18 Games, 13-5 Conference Championship: 14 Games, 5-9 Super Bowl: 5 Games, 3-2

At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year.
