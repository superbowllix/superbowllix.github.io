        <h2><strong>is super bowl bigger than nba finals super bowl sunday appetizers</strong></h2>
        <p>Compare the Super Bowl to the entirety of the NBA Finals. Compare a Wild Card Round game to a first-round NBA matchup. Compare a single regular season NFL game to a span of five NBA games. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event of the year by a wide margin. People who haven’t watched a single NFL game all year will plan Super Bowl parties. That’s not to say that people consciously think ‘winning the Super Bowl is more impressive than winning the NBA Finals’. But way more people care about the former than the latter. 
The Super Bowl actually brings in more revenue than both the NBA Playoffs and the MLB Playoffs combined. Last season, the revenue from Super Bowl LII easily surpassed $500 million. Ad spending alone for in-game spots exceeded $400 million, as it did the previous season. 
The 2021 NBA Finals were about as successful as a Milwaukee vs. Phoenix matchup in July could be, and grew 32% in total viewers from last year's series (when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the  
The NBA Finals air every year on ABC; Fox has the World Series rights on a long-term basis. The Super Bowl rotates between CBS, NBC and Fox. Due to a trade with NBC, CBS had the Super Bowl in both  
If you compare the NBA finals to the Superbowl it is a similar story. Super Bowl LV attracted 96.4 million viewers. It may be harsh to compare the two, as the Superbowl is a much bigger event than any single game in the NBA finals. It may be slightly fairer to compare the total viewership for the NBA finals and the Super Bowl . 
At its peak, in 2015, the Super Bowl earned 114.4 million viewers in the United States, with the 2014 Super Bowl said to have been watched by around 160 million viewers worldwide. As an annual tournament and a finale that is the culmination of a season of teams competing to get to the final, the best tournament to compare the Super Bowl to is  
Baltimore Ravens defensive end Calais Campbell argued that the NFL's single-game knockout format leaves no room for error, thus making the Super Bowl more difficult to win than an NBA championship  
A record 96.4 million viewers tuned in to watch Super Bowl LV. It may be unfair to compare the two since the Superbowl is a much bigger event than any individual game in the NBA finals. A more equitable comparison would be to compare the Super Bowl’s overall viewership with that of the NBA finals. As you add all of the viewers up, the margins  
Basketball, with its fast-paced, high-scoring games, tends to attract viewers who crave non-stop action. The NBA Finals, for instance, consistently draw millions of viewers worldwide. Football, with the strategic depth and the saga of a 90-minute match, has its own legion of fans who wouldn’t miss a Super Bowl or a World Cup Final for the world. 
ELI5: Why, exactly, has the Super Bowl become a much, much bigger cultural celebration in the USA than the World Series, NBA Finals, and Stanley Cup finals? Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. 
Between the Super Bowl and the NBA Finals, the super Bowl is and will always draw the bigger number no matter what for this simple reason. The Super Bowl is a SINGLE GAME and event. People who have no idea what the NFL or even American Football is will tune in because they can invest a few hours or day for this but the NBA Finals is a drawn out  
That's just an average football game, not a playoff game. Super Bowl XLVIII, by contrast, got a 46.7 average rating - meaning that: a) almost 3.5x as many people watched the Super Bowl than the Olympic opening ceremonies; and b) almost half the households in the US watched Super Bowl XLVIII. 
The Super Bowl acts a the punctuation mark to the long NFL season. After the Super Bowl, the sports world is entertained by the NBA All-Star weekend. The hype continues to be matched with NBA playoff basketball as fans are blessed with the opportunity to watch their favorite players battle in heated series from March until June. After the NBA  
The 2018 Super Bowl was watched by about 103 million people in the U.S. In other words, the Super Bowl had more viewers than all four NBA finals games combined. , I’m a lifelong NFL fan, and in particular, the Philadelphia Eagles. No question that the Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event in the United States. 
r/nfl is much much bigger than r/nba. Look at the super bowl threads and championship games they crash Reddit every single time. It got so bad that r/nfl had to opt out of r/all which lowered their subreddit growth. Being honest anyone saying that the NBA is bigger than the NFL in any facet is kidding themselves. 
In the great debate between the NBA Finals and the Super Bowl, it's hard to definitively say which event is bigger. Both sporting events have massive followings and draw in huge audiences from around the world. While the Super Bowl may have a slight edge in terms of TV viewership and advertising revenue, the NBA Finals can be just as intense and competitive. Personally, I think it's a matter  
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
A. In 2018, the Super Bowl audience was five times larger than that for the NBA Finals. B. Recent polls show that for the first time, a majority of parents say they would try and talk their children out of playing the game if they asked about joining a team. C. Only time will tell if America and football are headed for a break-up or a make-up. 
The Super Bowl could be the Indianapolis versus Carolina and it would still be a hit. In the NBA, however, everyone recognizes that Adam Silver would personally snipe Giannis in the knees, hold CP3’s family at gun point, and commit all manner of atrocities to prevent a Phoenix-Milwaukee finals. </p>
