        <h2><strong>eagles win super bowl super bowl channel directv schedule</strong></h2>
        <p>Philadelphia's Super Bowl 52 victory over the Patriots is its only (and therefore, most recent) Super Bowl win. The Eagles also appeared in the Super Bowl two years ago but lost to the Chiefs in  
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
The Eagles will look to become the 15th franchise in NFL history to win multiple Lombardi Trophies as they face the Chiefs in Super Bowl 59. Eagles Super Bowl record The Eagles have a 1-3 record  
Super Bowl: 4 (1-3) Pre-Super Bowl Championships: 4 (3-1) In all, the Philadelphia Eagles have played 54 postseason games in their 90+ year history. They are currently 28-26 in those contests. Their conference championship record sits at 5-4, and they are 1-3 in Super Bowls. They did win three championships in the pre-Super Bowl era (1948, 1949  
The Eagles have just one Super Bowl win, where they bested the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII (2018). Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl history: Super Bowl 1981: 27-10 loss to the  
Super Bowl 52 (2017 season): 41-33 win over New England Patriots Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 loss to Kansas City Chiefs Philadelphia Eagles running back has dominated the run game every  
Saquon Barkley dashed 60 yards for a touchdown on Philadelphia's first play and finished with 118 yards and three scores, Jalen Hurts rushed for three TDs and the Eagles soared into the Super Bowl with a 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders on Sunday. 
The Eagles were 1–4 against the Brady/Belichick era Patriots prior to this game (preseason notwithstanding), including Super Bowl XXXIX, their one win being a 35–28 win at Gillette Stadium in December during their relatively weak 2015 season, where after falling behind 14–0, they proceeded to rally for 35 points and hold them down to only  
The Philadelphia Eagles won their first-ever Super Bowl championship Sunday night, beating the New England Patriots, 41-33.  Philadelphia Eagles knock off Patriots, win Super Bowl Published  
While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
Super Bowl LII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2017 season.As a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX from 13 years earlier, the game was between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles and the American Football Conference (AFC) and defending Super Bowl LI champion New England Patriots. 
The Kansas City Chiefs will try to win their third consecutive title when they face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59 on Sunday, February 9. Kansas City is appearing in its fifth Super Bowl  
Jalen Hurts has a chance to do something only Nick Foles has ever done before: quarterback the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl victory. Standing in the way, just like in 2017, is an AFC dynasty. 
The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will square off in the 2025 Super Bowl. Here are the latest predictions on who will win the big game. 
An Eagles Super Bowl title will give that bettor a $350,000 win (total payout $400,000). That same customer, on that same day, also made a $50,000 bet on Eagles +325 to win the NFC. 
Why: Another close win for the Chiefs to complete the three-peat as Chris Jones takes advantage of the Eagles' OL injuries to win Super Bowl MVP. Mike Band: Chiefs 24, Eagles 20. 
Super Bowl 59 predictions: Why you should bet on the Eagles to win 1. Saquon Barkley. The Chiefs just barely outlasted the Eagles 38-35 two years ago in Super Bowl 57, but these teams are vastly  
Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is making Super Bowl MVP odds history, and if Philly wins the big game, he will have his say.. This is far from a one-dimensional team, though. In  
Eagles Super Bowl record. The Eagles have just a 1-3 record in the Super Bowl. Their lone win came during the 2017 NFL playoffs (played in 2018) and saw Nick Foles lead the team to a 41-33 win  
Last season’s follow-up to the Super Bowl appearance was disappointing. The Eagles began 10-1 but came undone and were eliminated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round of the playoffs. </p>
