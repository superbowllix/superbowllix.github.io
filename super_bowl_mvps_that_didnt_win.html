        <p>Chuck Howley didn't win in Super Bowls in Super Bowl V against the Baltimore Colts on January 17, 1971.  super bowl mvp in a season that did not win by a player. NAME 
16 players didn't win in their careers. The first three are Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Matt Ryan. NAME W MVP ROUND GP  Manning P. Manning . 0. 2. Super Bowl. 2  
Bud Abell didn't win the Super Bowl MVP award in Super Bowls in his career. 
Since the Super Bowl’s inception in 1967, there has only been one player — Cowboys LB Chuck Howley — Who went on to win the Super Bowl MVP despite falling short against the Baltimore Colts. A Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor inductee was initially drafted by the Bears in 1958. The ex-gas station worker dreamed of making a mark in football  
The Falcons were unable to hang onto their lead, however, as two touchdowns by Frank Gore (another great player that didn't win a Super Bowl) lifted San Francisco to a 28-24 win. 
He ended his 17-year NFL career with 3,988 completions for 49,325 yards, 291 touchdowns, and 233 interceptions. He was a nine-time Pro Bowler and First-team All-Pro in 1990, also taking home the NFL’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 1990. But for all his successes, he didn’t win the Super Bowl. 
Over the course of NFL history, there have been some sensational Super Bowl performances. These 5 performances were not quite MVP-worthy, but still outstanding. 
From Dan Marino to Randy Moss, some of the best players in NFL history never won a Super Bowl. Here are 17 who deserved to win it all.  (186), winning MVP in 2006, and appearing in five Pro  
Only in the 1984 season did Marino, then in his second year, and the Miami Dolphins play on the sport's biggest stage, and it ended with a 38-16 loss to Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers. 
The Hall of Famer made nine Pro Bowls, won the 1975 MVP and appeared in three Super Bowls with the Vikings. He still ranks 12th in career passing yards and also rushed for 3,674 yards and 32  
Here are my choices for seven times the Super Bowl MVP went to the wrong player. Top 7 'Almost' Super Bowl MVPs 7. Super Bowl XXV: Jeff Hostetler Real MVP Winner: Ottis Anderson. Ottis Anderson ran the ball 24 times for 102 yards and a touchdown, but I was shocked then and now thinking he was the game's MVP. Here are a few things to remember. 
The Super Bowl is by far the biggest stage in sports. More than 90 million people tune in to watch the final game of the NFL season each year. That means that all eyes are on the two teams that face off, which happen to be the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles in this year's showdown. 
Over the course of NFL history, there have been some sensational Super Bowl performances. These 10 performances were not quite MVP-worthy, but still outstanding. 10. Damien Williams (2020) Patrick Mahomes won MVP in this game for helping the Chiefs come back from a 10-point deficit in the second half, but his 2 TD passes were 
Jackson is the only quarterback to win the MVP award since Brian Sipe of the Cleveland Browns in 1980 who has never played in a Super Bowl. Jackson is also the only player with multiple MVP awards  
More Top Teams That Didn’t Win The Super Bowl So many people remember the 1990 49ers, who were going for a three-peat, as one of the great teams to fall short of the Super Bowl. But the Joe Montana-led Niners (7.0926) were dead-last among the 23 best teams since 1978 and not anywhere close to the next-lowest team on the list. 
Still, it's a little surprising voters didn't go QB here.  the last running back to win Super Bowl MVP was Terrell Davis in 1997 after the Broncos first of two Super Bowl wins -- it's this year

Moon and Rivers didn't win an NFL championship. Aikman, Brees, Manning and—spoiler alert—Roger Staubach each celebrated at least one title and landed Super Bowl MVP recognition. 
The 2015 regular season MVP went 32,382 passing and 5,628 rushing yards, along with a quarterback record of 75 rushing touchdowns. His unparalleled performance led the Carolina Panthers to a franchise-best 15–1 record, three Pro Bowl selections, and 2015 First-Team All-Pro honors. 
At the time, winning MVP was a bad omen for your team's postseason hopes as the MVP winner's team didn't win the Super Bowl in the same season from 2000-21. So, maybe it was for the best for Kupp  </p>
