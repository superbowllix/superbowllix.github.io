        <p>The Chiefs have a long legacy of Super Bowl appearances dating back to the NFL's original championship games. But the franchise is in the midst of an extraordinary dynastic run in the 21st century. 
They won Super Bowl 54 against the 49ers in 2020, then lost in Super Bowl 55 to Tom Brady and the Buccaneers in 2021. After that, the Chiefs went to (and won) back-to-back Super Bowls in each of  
How many times have the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl? The Kansas City Chiefs have won a total of 4 Super Bowls, in 1969, 2019 and 2022-2023. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in Kansas City. 
Below is the complete list of Chiefs Super Bowl appearances dating back to Super Bowl 1, which was played in 1967. Super Bowl 1: Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10 Super Bowl 4: Kansas  
With a win, the Chiefs would join the Steelers, Patriots, 49ers and Cowboys as the only franchises that have won at least five Super Bowls. Kansas City won its fourth Super Bowl following last  
Kansas City also earned a last-second win in their most recent Super Bowl win over the Eagles. Harrison Butker made a field goal with 8 seconds remaining to give the Chiefs a 38-35 victory. 
The Chiefs have won four Super Bowls: IV (1970), LIV (2020), LVII (2023), and LVIII (2024). Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl History Super Bowl 1967: 35-10 loss to Green Bay Packers 
Feb. 11, 2024: An overtime win for Kansas City — The Chiefs became the first back-to-back Super Bowl champion in two decades when they defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime at Super  
The Chiefs enter Super Bowl LVIII as the defending Super Bowl champions, having won the Super Bowl last season with a 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. In Sunday’s game, they’re aiming to become the first repeat Super Bowl champions since the New England Patriots won back-to-back Lombardi Trophies in the 2003 and 2004 seasons. 
However, before the arrival of star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs only had one Super Bowl title to their name and that came in 1969. Now with head coach Andy Reid and Mahomes striking a near perfect relationship, the Chiefs have become one of the must-watch teams in the NFL and are always a fixture in the playoffs and Super Bowl . 
The Kansas City Chiefs stand on the brink of history. With one more victory, they’ll become the first team in NFL history to win three straight Super Bowls. It’s a feat that would cement  
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles play on Sunday, Feb. 9 at Caesars Superdome in the Super Bowl game of the NFL playoffs.. Will the Eagles or the Chiefs win the Super Bowl? The Chiefs  
The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will square off in the 2025 Super Bowl. Here are the latest predictions on who will win the big game. 
LAS VEGAS — The NFL has a repeat champion for the first time in 19 years. The Kansas City Chiefs, with a third Super Bowl triumph in five seasons, cemented the league’s modern-day dynasty with  
Mahomes completed 21-of-27 passes for 182 yards and three touchdowns in the game, earning Super Bowl MVP honors for his efforts. Mahomes is the only player in NFL history to lead the league in passing yards and passing touchdowns, win NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same season. 
If the Kansas City Chiefs win the Super Bowl on Sunday, quarterback Patrick Mahomes will be the 11th Associated Press MVP to win a Super Bowl in the same season. The last player to achieve both  
Why: Another close win for the Chiefs to complete the three-peat as Chris Jones takes advantage of the Eagles' OL injuries to win Super Bowl MVP. Mike Band: Chiefs 24, Eagles 20 
Super Bowl MVP predictions in Super Bowl LIX. I don't think there's any question about the order in which you would assume Super Bowl MVP for this game is going to be decided: Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs; Saquon Barkley, RB, Eagles; Jalen Hurts, QB, Eagles; It would take a herculean effort by anybody else in this game to be awarded Super Bowl MVP. 
The Modern Era . This era saw the completion of the Patriots' dynasty, which saw the team play in nine Super Bowls over a 20-year run. It also marked the rise of the Kansas City Chiefs, led by  
Along with winning three straight Super Bowls, a win over the Eagles would give the Chiefs four Super Bowl titles over a six-year span, something only the 1970s Steelers have accomplished. The  </p>
