        <p>Yes, this has happened 5 times in history. The 1998 St. Louis Rams (4-12), 2000 New England Patriots (5-11), 1980 San Francisco 49ers (6-10), 2019 Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9) and 2016 Philadelphia Eagles (7-9) all won the Super Bowl the next season after having a losing record. 
This game still holds the records for most combined points (75) and total touchdowns (10) in Super Bowl history, with the majority of the damage (49 and 7) done by game MVP Young and his 49ers. 6  
The 2007 Giants, on paper, were very mediocre. They were 14th in points per game, 17th in points allowed, and had just a +22 point differential, which is the second worst for a Super Bowl-winning team in NFL history. The Giants were 10-6 in the regular season and barely squeaked into the playoffs. 
Who is the worst team to make the Super Bowl? Based on regular season winning percentage, the 2008 Arizona Cardinals (9-7), 1979 Los Angeles Rams (9-7) and 2011 New York Giants (9-7) were the worst teams to make the Super Bowl. 
8 teams are tied for the worst record in Super Bowls, with a record of 0-1. The first three are the Arizona Cardinals, the Carolina Panthers and the Tennessee Titans.

20 teams are tied for the worst record in a Super Bowl, with a record of 0-1. The first three are the San Francisco 49ers on February 11, on February 2, 2020 and on February 3, 2013, the Philadelphia Eagles on February 12, 2023 and on February 6, 2005 and the Cincinnati Bengals on February 13, 2022.

Early in the season, this team was 2-3 and miles from a Super Bowl. Somehow, Jim Plunkett came in to save the day for the Raiders, helping them to get on track. But Plunkett is remembered as one of the worst Super Bowl-winning QBs of all time and the 1980 Raiders are one of the worst teams to win a Super Bowl. 
The worst teams to win the Super Bowl had a long path to do so. Each team was a No. 4 seed or lower, which means it had to travel on the road for multiple games. The number of wins also weighed heavily in the rankings, along with the playoff status from the year before and after the magical Super Bowl run. 
The last team to finish with a losing record and miss the playoffs after winning the Super Bowl are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They had won the 37th edition of the Super Bowl 48-21 defeating the

The then-losingest team in history to make a Super Bowl, with no notable players beyond JPP and Manning, beat the “unstoppable” Patriots in the most-watched event in tv history at the time. It’s like training your whole life to run a race just to get beaten by the guy who discovered shoes yesterday. And it was glorious. 
10. Super Bowl XLVIII. The Denver Broncos entered the Super Bowl XLVIII as a great offensive team that scored a record-breaking 606 points during the 2013 NFL regular season.

At the time, the Rams would have the worst record of any team to play in the Super Bowl, a record that wouldn’t be tied until the 2008 season. Los Angeles lived and died by the strength of their defensive line, a second version of their Fearsome Foursome that featured Fred Dryer and Jack Youngblood. 
Among Super Bowl teams, the performances by the Baltimore Colts and Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V are among the worst in history. The Colts, for their part, managed to turn the ball over a whopping seven times, with four fumbles and three interceptions (via Pro Football Reference). The Cowboys, determined to mimic the Colts' ineptitude, had
