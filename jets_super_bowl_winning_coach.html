        <p>The following NFL head coaches have coached in two or more Super Bowls. Of eligible coaches not in the Hall of Fame, only two have had three or more appearances: Mike Holmgren and Dan Reeves. There are only two eligible coaches with multiple wins to not be inducted into the Hall of Fame: George Seifert and Mike Shanahan. 
Herman Edwards is the only Jets head coach to lead the team to the playoffs more than twice; Rex Ryan is the only one with more than two postseason wins. Todd Bowles and Robert Saleh are the only ones to coach the Jets for more than two seasons without making the playoffs. 
With six Super Bowl victories, Bill Belichick leads all coaches, four more than former Steelers coach Chuck Noll. New England has won the Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LII under Belichick's direction. Additionally, he led the team to Super Bowls XLII, XLVI, and LII, which they all lost by a single point.

The New York Jets, led by head coach Weeb Ewbank (who was the head coach of the Colts when they won the famous 1958 NFL Championship game and later the '59 title also), finished the season with an 11–3 regular season record (one of the losses was to the Oakland Raiders in the infamous "Heidi Game") and had to rally to defeat those same  
As of December 2024, the last time the New York Jets won a Super Bowl was in 1969. It was Super Bowl III which was played at the Orange Bowl stadium in Miami, Florida. The Jets won

Super Bowl-Winning Coaches. In total, 14 head coaches have won multiple Super Bowls. Another 21 have won a single Super Bowl, meaning 35 different head coaches have won at least one Super Bowl. Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid became the 14th different coach with multiple Super Bowl rings when he won Super Bowl LVII in 2023.

The coach has often been at his best late in games, like when he used pre-snap motion to dial up two easy passing touchdowns for Mahomes in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LVII or unleashed his

Under Noll’s masterful coaching, the Steelers made their first Super Bowl appearance and win in 1974. Similarly, he helped the team to win Super Bowl X, XIII, and  
Travis Kelce cleared the air on his viral shove of Andy Reid during the Chiefs Super Bowl win last year. The Kansas City Chiefs are back in the Super Bowl for the third straight year, and while  
It reached another level two years later. After the Giants won Super Bowl XXI to close out the 1986 season, star linebacker Harry Carson donned a security jacket and snuck up behind Parcells for another Gatorade shower.
