        <p>Here is a graph showing the DVOA of each Super Bowl champion. The Y-Axis shows Defensive DVOA, from negative at the top to positive at the bottom. Remember, for DVOA, negative ratings are better for defenses. 
The Dallas Cowboys won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXVII and XXVIII); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl XXIX champion San Francisco 49ers. 
The most unlikely team never to win a Super Bowl turns out to be a team that lost “only” two Super Bowls, but that has led the NFL in DVOA four times since 1979. To figure this stuff out, I’ve utilized DVOA ratings and estimated DVOA ratings to rerun the NFL playoffs. 
DVOA is a percentage, so a team with a DVOA of 10.0% is 10 percent better than the average team, and a quarterback with a DVOA of -20.0% is 20 percent worse than the average quarterback. Because DVOA measures scoring, defenses are better when they are negative.

We've done our best to rank all 58 Super Bowl champions here from worst to best, looking at both the regular season and the playoffs to find the most powerful teams in NFL history. To rank 
Super Bowl teams ranked higher in offensive DVOA over this span have a 5-13 record. Teams with the higher-ranked offense had lost nine straight Super Bowls before the Chiefs win a year ago. Teams ranked higher in defensive DVOA have an 11-7 record. 
Despite being the first Wild Card team to win a Super Bowl, DVOA had the 2005 Steelers as the fourth-best team in the regular season, and beating the three teams that finished higher than 
Using his advanced-stat DVOA ratings (which you can read more about here), Schatz estimated the play-by-play efficiency for every team to win a Super Bowl. And his findings have the 2009 Saints 
Super Bowl Winners. The best team doesn’t always win the Super Bowl, but DVOA does a great job of telling us who the contenders are. 
For the metrics that are rankings, those with the lowest average ranking (i.e. closest to 1) are those most correlated with champion teams (i.e. the Super Bowl winner is a top team in this metric). 
The 1972 Fins went undefeated and won the next Super Bowl, but they finished behind the 1971 Cowboys- the 21st-best Super Bowl-winning team ever- in this countdown. 9. 1995 Cowboys (defeated  
Here is a graph showing the DVOA of each Super Bowl champion. The Y-Axis shows Defensive DVOA, from negative at the top to positive at the bottom. Remember, for DVOA, negative ratings are better for defenses. The X-Axis shows offensive DVOA from left to right. As expected, most teams are clustered in the upper right corner of the chart. 
The lowest-ranked Super Bowl winner in pass-defense DVOA was 21st (2016 Patriots), the second-highest cut-off after overall DVOA. Five teams made the Super Bowl ranked 22nd or worse in DVOA against the pass — and all of them lost. The gap of 4.9 between the average Super Bowl winner's ranking and average Super Bowl loser's ranking is the

Analytics predicts winner for Super Bowl LVIII We already know who wins the 2024 Super Bowl because DVOA says so By JaredMueller @JaredKMueller Feb 7, 2024, 8:00am EST 
Replace “Super Bowl LVIII” with “Super Bowl LIX” and nothing has changed. Everybody knows about Kansas City’s absurd record in close games and their constant narrow escapes all season long. Despite going 15-2, they finished eighth in DVOA. 
Odds to Win Super Bowl LIX. Revised as of 1/27/25, through Week 21. Compiled by Mike Harris. The NFL playoff picture odds report plays out the season 25,000 times. A random draw assigns each team a win or loss for each game. 
After yesterday’s post, I thought it would be fun to look at the DVOA ratings of each Super Bowl champion, using actual numbers from since 1989 and estimated from prior to that. Here is a graph showing the DVOA of each Super Bowl champion. The Y-Axis shows Defensive DVOA, from negative at the top to positive at the bottom. 
The Chiefs have defeated the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII.There have now been 58 Super Bowls since the NFL champion first took on the AFL champion after the 1966 season, which means we have 58 teams  </p>
