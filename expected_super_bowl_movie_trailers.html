Disney, Paramount and Universal are willing to pony up $7.5 million-$8 million for a 30-second trailer spot during this year's Super Bowl. 
This year’s Super Bowl movie trailers are storming the field ahead of the Big Game as Hollywood seeks a return to the blockbuster summers of years past. To achieve that, the major movie studios  
Ethan Hunt, M3GAN, and some hungry dinosaurs are about to crash the big game, but Elphaba and Glinda are sitting the Super Bowl out. The Kansas City Chiefs will take on the Philadelphia Eagles on  
The Super Bowl isn't just about football, it’s also one of the biggest nights for movie trailers, and this year is no exception. With the game set to take place at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on February 9, a handful of major studios are locking in their spots. 
This year's Super Bowl will be held at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 9, and following a recent (rumored) rundown of the big trailers/TV spots expected to debut, we have a list of the confirmed teasers - along with the movies that won't be showcased during the annual sporting event.

These 12 films all have at least a chance of airing trailers in this year's Super Bowl.  this year’s Super Bowl is expected to have plenty of glimpses of the upcoming movie calendar  
The Super Bowl is the most-watched television broadcast in the United States every year. In 2024, the Kansas City Chiefs clash with the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII (58 for the Roman numeral illiterate) drew an average of 123.7 million viewers across linear and streaming services in the U.S. alone. 
Sunday’s Super Bowl LIX, where the Kansas City Chiefs will defend their title against the Philadelphia Eagles, is bound to bring a bevy of trailers for movie 
However, not every studio or streaming giant is thought to show a movie trailer during the Super Bowl advertisement break. Both Netflix and Amazon are not expected to air a trailer, nor are

It cannot be denied: The Super Bowl generally translates into big box office. However, there are only three motion picture studios — Disney, Paramount and Universal — willing to pony up $7.5 million-$8 million for a 30-second spot on Fox before an audience that last year reached 123.7 million viewers across live linear and streaming.

According to Deadline, Sony, Warner Bros., Netflix, Amazon MGM Studios, and Lionsgate are sitting out this year’s Super Bowl. It is also not expected that Apple Studios will have any trailers. The last time Warner Bros. made a big play during the Super Bowl was for The Flash – in 2023. </p>
