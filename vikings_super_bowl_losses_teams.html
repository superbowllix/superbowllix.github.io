This makes it hard for any team to reach the Super Bowl, and even harder to win it. Many teams have reached the Super Bowl and many have made it all the way to the big game only to face devastating defeat. Losing is a fundamental part of Super Bowl history for many teams. Let’s find out which teams have lost the most Super Bowls! 
In the first week of the 2010 NFL regular season, the Vikings played the defending Super Bowl champions, the New Orleans Saints. The Vikings lost 14–9. [92] In Week 2, the Vikings played the Miami Dolphins and lost 14–10. The Vikings defeated the Detroit Lions 24–10 in the third week of the season. 
Have the Vikings Ever Won the Super Bowl? No. The Minnesota Vikings have never won the Super Bowl. The Vikings have reached the Super Bowl a total of four times (1970, 1974, 1975, and 1977) but have never won. They are one of two teams in NFL history that have reached the Super Bowl four times without a win. The other is the Buffalo Bills.

The New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos are tied for losing the most games in Super Bowls, with 5 losses. 
When Was the Last Time the Vikings Made the Super Bowl? Minnesota last went to a Super Bowl almost 50 years ago. In 1976, led by Rookie of the Year Sammy White and All-Pro Chuck Foreman, they made it to Super Bowl 11, their third Super Bowl appearance in four seasons, but lost in humiliating fashion to the Raiders 32-14. 
The Vikings lost the Super Bowl in 1969 and 1973. In 1974 they faced the Pittsburgh Steelers in their first Super Bowl appearance. The Vikings had been heavy favorites against the Chiefs in ’69  
One most common denominator in all of the Vikings’ Super Bowl losses were turnovers. Minnesota turned the ball over a total of 15 times in their four Super Bowl games. In Super Bowl IX, they committed five costly turnovers. Erase any two of them from the ledger, and the Vikings might have won Super Bowl IX.
