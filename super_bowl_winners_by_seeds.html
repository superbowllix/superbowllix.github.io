        <p>The #2 seed has also done well in the Super Bowl, with the AFC's #2 seed winning six Super Bowls since 1975, and the NFC's #2 seed winning four Super Bowls. Funnily enough, the #4 seed has managed to win the Super Bowl seven times since 1975, with AFC teams accounting for four of these wins. #3, #5 and #6 seeds have all won the Super Bowl twice

The Rams lost Super Bowl XIV 31-19 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1979 as the No. 3 seed. On the other side of the ball we have a No. 1 seed. Since 1990, including the Niners, 33 top-seeded teams  
The last time the Eagles were the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, after the 2017 season, they advanced to Super Bowl 52. There they beat the AFC No. 1-seeded Patriots 41-33. 
Montana was named Super Bowl MVP, setting five Super Bowl records in the win while also becoming the third player to win the Super MVP and AP MVP in the same season. Super Bowl 26: Redskins vs Bills The NFL expanded the playoffs to 12 teams in 1990, and Washington and the Bills were the first teams to both make the Super Bowl as the No. 1 seed  
• Since 2000, only two No. 1 seeds have won the Super Bowl -- the 2009 Saints and the 2003 Patriots. In that same span, four No. 2 seeds, one No. 3 seed, two No. 4 seeds, one No. 5 seed and two No. 6 seeds have won the Super Bowl. • In the first 12 years of the “home-field era” (post-1974), 10 No. 1 seeds won the Super Bowl. 
Pittsburgh won 21-10 and head coach Bill Cowher and running back Jerome Bettis were able to retire as Super Bowl champions. The 2005 Steelers were the first team to win a Super Bowl as a No. 6 seed.

Well, last year, neither #1 seed made it to the Super Bowl-- it was the Bengals, seeded #4, who beat the #1 and #2 AFC seeds. The Rams were also the #4 seed in the NFC who defeated the #2 seed to play the SB in their home stadium. Your chances of winning improve drastically once you get to the big game.

About three-quarters (32 of 42) of teams that made the Super Bowl got a bye (first or second seed) from 1999 to 2019 made the Super Bowl. This included 52% of teams that were the one seed and 24%  
It's also interesting to compare how these teams did in the playoffs. Of the top 10 20th century teams (I'll cheat a little by dipping into part of the cap era) in differential, 6 won the Super Bowl, 2 made the Super Bowl, and the other two were ranked 9th and 10th. Of the top 10 21st century teams in point differential, zero won the Super Bowl. 
Now they would become the only franchise in the modern playoff era to win a Super Bowl as the No. 6 seed and lose a Super Bowl to a 6-seed. The Packers built leads of 14-0 in the second quarter and 21-10 in the third, then held on to beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round 21-16, sealing the victory by intercepting Michael Vick in
