Despite a late surge by the Patriots, the Eagles’ defense, led by Brandon Graham, made a crucial strip-sack of Brady in the final minutes. Philadelphia emerged victorious with a 41-33 win, and Nick Foles was named Super Bowl MVP. The triumph marked the franchise’s first Super Bowl win and solidified their place in NFL history.

When the Eagles faced the Chiefs back at Super Bowl LVII, all that was missing for Philly was a running threat, and now they have got it. If Barkley can find successfully navigate the gameplan devised by Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, the Eagles will enjoy their time on offense and win the game.
