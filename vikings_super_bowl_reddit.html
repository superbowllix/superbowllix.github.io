        <p>It's unclear if the data set includes the Super Bowl, which would weigh both stats more towards the AFC. The first three years favored the NFC but the rest of the decade saw the AFC pass and stay ahead in head-to-head games. 
r/DidTheVikingsWinSB: Welcome to: “Did The Vikings Win The Super Bowl?” Everyday on this Subreddit, we tell you if the Minnesota Vikings have won a 
You’re telling me this 33rd team would have a 1/33 chance of winning the Super Bowl? Or what if we reduced the league to 2 teams: the team of kindergarteners and the current Minnesota Vikings. You think the team of kindergarteners would have a 1/2 (50%) chance of winning the Super Bowl? 
Vikings fans would love to forget it. The Broncos came into that season as the reigning champions, having won their first Super Bowl in team history with an upset over the Green Bay Packers. 
What happened to Aaron Jones today? If the Vikings beat Detroit on Sunday, they will go to the Super Bowl. If our running game was better, I would say Yes. The only problem with our running game is that we don't run enough. 
The odds don’t favor it — the Detroit Lions and Kansas City Chiefs are supposed to reach the Super Bowl — but the Vikings have a puncher’s chance. The Odds per DVOA: 3.9%. 4. Lose in the Super Bowl 
Per new reporting from The Athletic, Minnesota reportedly wants current QB1 Sam Darnold back in 2025, a plot twist compared to a couple of months ago when the popular theory suggested the 2025 Vikings would belong to rookie passer J.J. McCarthy. 
The Minnesota Vikings have played 4 games in Super Bowls all-time. TEAM DATE GP ROUND  jalen hurts career stats in the super bowl. 5 . most rushing yards in a  
Thanks to ESPN’s Field Yates, a statistic dribbled out of Week 5 vivifying the Vikings’ genuine chances of reaching the Super Bowl and perhaps winning the damn thing — after 58 unsuccessful attempts since 1966. 
Say the rest of the games this year played out like the Viks vs Raiders and we got to and won the Super Bowl by playing exactly as we did last night would you be happy? I mean, it would be like Vikings win the Super Bowl***. 
Here’s how the Super Bowl odds have changed from week to week I’ve been tracking the Superbowl odds every week since the start of the season. Odds are all pulled from DraftKings before each week kicks off on Thursdays. 
Perhaps the greatest madden team I’ve ever built. Finally won Super Bowl with Minnesota in 2028. I lost 2 Super Bowls to KC in the process, but beat Jacksonville this year. Had to share this season because I cannot afford to keep majority of them next year lol. 
The NFL gives teams $4,000 for each Super Bowl ring, and team owners spend their own money to improve them. The rings Chicago Bears players received from the McCaskey family for Super Bowl XX cost $4,000. 
They made the whole narrative about a redemption arc and feel good for people in NO after the Katrina Hurricane situation. In the NFCCG the refs didn’t call blatant illegal hits on Vikings’ QB Favre and essentially tilted the game to NO so the Saints could go win the Super Bowl against the Colts(?) so that the people of New Orleans could have a fairytale ending. 
A little more than half of the whole nfl has won a super bowl less than half have won 2 or more. The thing about the Vikings is they've had about 5 super bowl caliber teams have never reached their goal. 
[Jeremy Fowler] People around the league are keeping an eye on the Minnesota Vikings at No. 11, too. They did a lot of quarterback homework last offseason and could eventually target one high in the draft with free agent Kirk Cousins' future in Minnesota uncertain. 
I'd rather talk and reminisce about the one Super Bowl win for the rest of my days instead of lamenting about what could have been all the time. I think our fandom identity would shift to clutching that one shining moment forever. It'd probably make us insufferable, but I don't really care. Just give me one.

One Super Bowl and then sucking after means not the best coach. One Super Bowl and a 5-10+ year stretch after with a .550-.600 career record with maybe a couple more playoff wins means best coach in Vikings history. 
They haven't appeared in a super bowl since 1977. You'd have to be at least 50 years old to remember that, so this meme fits perfectly considering this is reddit where the average age is like 25 </p>
