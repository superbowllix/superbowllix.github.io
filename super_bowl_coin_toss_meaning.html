Here are a handful of trends we’ve unearthed from the Super Bowl coin toss results: The coin toss has been Tails in seven of the last 11 Super Bowls; The team who won the coin toss has lost the Super Bowl in eight of the last ten years, and is 26-32 all-time; The Cowboys hold the record for most Super Bowl coin toss wins with five

In Super Bowl 48, the Seahawks, who won the coin toss and deferred, ended up losing to the Patriots (no doubt because of the curse and not Russell Wilson’s 1-yard line interception). 
The Super Bowl coin toss curse. In each of the last eight Super Bowls, the team that won the coin toss has gone on to lose the game. It's a streak that dates back to 2014, when the Patriots lost

The Eagles have found success in both the coin toss and Super Bowl, especially recently. The Eagles have been to the Super Bowl four times.
