        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The Denver Broncos have had quarterbacks who won Super Bowls. 
Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320

FILE - In this Jan. 31, 1988, file photo, Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway winds up to let go of a 56-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ricky Nattiel in the first quarter of Super Bowl XXII against the Washington Redskins in San Diego, Calif. Elway threw the pass on the Broncos' first play from scrimmage and Rich Karlis kicked a 24-yard field goal on the next possession to take a 10-0  
[69] [70] Elway won a third Super Bowl as part of the Broncos franchise, on February 7, 2016, when Denver defeated the Carolina Panthers 24–10 in Super Bowl 50. This gave him his first Super Bowl win as Executive VP/GM, to go along with the two he won as the team's quarterback. 
Denver Broncos. 2. XXXII, XXXIII. 1. Roger Staubach. Dallas Cowboys. 2. VI, XII. 1.  The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom  
The Denver Broncos are one of the most successful teams in the NFL and have three Super Bowl wins to their name. The Broncos won Super Bowl XXXII (1997), Super Bowl XXXIII (1998), and Super Bowl  
The team went on to win the Super Bowl that year, and have missed out on the playoffs with more losses than wins every year ever since, except 2016.  Denver Broncos quarterback Jeff Driskel  
The last running back to be crowned Super Bowl MVP was Terrell Davis in 1997, when he recorded 157 rushing yards in the Denver Broncos win. Non-quarterback’s to win Super Bowl MVP Here is a list of all 26 non-quarterback’s to be named Super Bowl MVP as well as their position, team and the year they won. 
Doug Williams, QB, Washington, Super Bowl XXII vs. Denver Broncos (1987) SAN DIEGO – JANUARY 31: Quarterback Doug Williams #17 of the Washington Redskins drops back to pass during Super Bowl XXII against the Denver Broncos at Jack Murphy Stadium on January 31, 1988 in San Diego, California. 
He became the first black quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl, and he didn't just win, either, dominating the Denver Broncos in a 42-10 win. Williams finished the game throwing for 340 yards  
Super Bowl XII provided an opportunity for Morton to not only beat his former team, but also to redeem himself for his Super Bowl V loss and the loss of his starting job to Staubach. For Staubach, he had a chance to win his second Super Bowl and defeat his old rival, showing that he truly was the better quarterback of the two. 
He became the first black quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl, and he didn't just win, either, dominating the Denver Broncos in a 42-10 win. Williams finished the game throwing for 340 yards, four touchdowns, and just one interception, out-dueling a fellow future Hall of Famer in John Elway. 
The Broncos finally put their Super Bowl jinx behind them in 1998 and 1999 as the great John Elway led Denver to their first two championships. Another disappointment followed in 2014 against the Seahawks, but Denver's most recent appearance in a Super Bowl was a winning one thanks in large part to a standout defensive performance from now

NEW ORLEANS (WISH) — Former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Carson Wentz is preparing for the Super Bowl. It’s his second time making the Super Bowl, as he made Super Bowl LII with the Eagles  
The Broncos lost Super Bowl XXI to the New York Giants, 39–20; Super Bowl XXII to the Washington Redskins, 42–10; and Super Bowl XXIV to the San Francisco 49ers, 55–10; the latter score remains the most lopsided scoring differential in Super Bowl history. [25]
