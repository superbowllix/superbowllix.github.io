        <p>Super Bowl XLIX was the first Super Bowl matchup, and the first postseason matchup, between the Patriots and Seahawks; while Seattle was part of the AFC before moving to the NFC in the NFL's 2002 realignment, the teams had never met beyond the regular season. 
The Jets' most recent championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002

Relive the adrenaline rush of the Super Bowl XLIX matchup between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks where Patriots quarterback Tom Brady went 37/50 for 328 yards and four touchdowns. The Patriots would go on to win 28-24 and claim their fourth Super Bowl title. 
Super Bowl XLIX (meaning Super Bowl 49 in Roman numerals) was an American football game in which the New England Patriots, winners of the American Football Conference (AFC) for the 2014 season, beat the Seattle Seahawks, winners of the National Football Conference (NFC), 28–24 to become winners of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2014 season. 
Super Bowl XLIX was an American football game played to determine the champions of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2014 season.

The Seattle Seahawks returned again for Super Bowl XLIX, breaking the NFL’s 11-year drought in consecutive Super Bowl appearances by a single team. The 49th Super Bowl was perhaps one of the most dead-even matchups on the big stage in a battle of two 12-4 teams with the No. 1 seeds in their conferences: The Seahawks and Patriots.

No Super Bowl champion since New England in 2004 had made it back to the title game the following season. The Seahawks, coming off a one-sided victory in Super Bowl XLVIII and having one of the National Football League's youngest and most talented teams, were 2014 preseason favorites to reach the Super Bowl again. But they struggled along the way. 
The defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks looked to repeat, but it wasn’t an easy start. They began the season 3-3, but after that, they went 9-1 the rest of the way, including a six-game winning streak to end the regular season to finish first in the NFC West at 12-4. 
Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs won a shootout in the first matchup, defeating the Eagles 38-35 in Arizona for the Super Bowl LVII crown. Now, the Chiefs will look to become the first team in NFL  
Brady noted that the Super Bowl is a bit of an abnormality compared to most other games teams played in the Super Bowl, which played a hand in how he and his teams might have approached the game  
Game summary of the New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks NFL game, final score 28-24, from February 1, 2015 on ESPN. 
Super Bowl XLIX was the first Super Bowl matchup, and the first postseason matchup, between the Patriots and Seahawks; while Seattle was part of the AFC before moving to the NFC in the NFL's 2002 realignment, the teams had never met beyond the regular season. 
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game.
