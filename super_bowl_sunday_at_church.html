Win or lose, you can score points as the ultimate in hosting the Super Bowl. 1. Invite your Guests or Ministry in Style. Super Bowl Sunday is one of the biggest Sundays of the year, at least for pro football fans. So why not take the opportunity to turn it into a super Sunday for your church by opening your doors to the local community. 
It’s the biggest day in American football—and this year, we’re bringing the game-day excitement straight to church! Super Bowl Sunday, February 9, is going to be one to remember. No matter which team you’re cheering for (or even if you’re just here for the snacks), we can all agree on one thing: the commercials are the best part of  
It’s still not too late for your church to use some or all of the resources to make Super Bowl Sunday a day of outreach and spiritual growth. Even millions of people who aren’t football fans attend parties and gatherings every year on Super Bowl Sunday, which is the single biggest secular event of the year in the United States. 
20 Church Super Bowl Party Ideas The NFL’s “big game” is right around the corner, which can be a great chance for you to host a party for your church or youth group. And while it can be really fun to get together with a bunch of Christians, events like this could be great opportunities to invite non-churched friends! 
It’s advisable for churches to call the event a “big game” party rather than a “Super Bowl” party, as both the “NFL” and “Super Bowl” are trademarked and protected intellectual property. For example, one church last year called their event a “Souper Bowl” party and asked for donations of canned soup for a local ministry. 
Included in this resource is the message, sermon notes, a small group study guide, graphics, and project files, as well as some promo videos to give you ideas on how to promote the teaching before Super Bowl Sunday. Feel free to tailor the teaching to the size and scope of a Super Bowl Sunday at your church.
