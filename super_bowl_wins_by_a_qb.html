        <p>Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
This is a list of National Football League (NFL) quarterbacks who have started in the Super Bowl. Hall of Famers Bart Starr (top) and Len Dawson (bottom) started in the first Super Bowl for the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs respectively. 
Here is a complete list of the starting QBs that took center stage after their team won in the first 58 editions of the Super Bowl. A group of starting signal-callers have been lucky enough to kiss the Lombardi at least once in their careers as the victors of the NFL’s showcase event. 
Several quarterbacks have won multiple Super Bowls, and Patrick Mahomes will look to join that list on Sunday by winning Super Bowl LV. Editor's note: The Buccaneers beat the Chiefs, 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
10. John Elway – 2 Super Bowl Wins. John Elway is a quarterback who won two Super Bowl titles with the Denver Broncos during his career. Elway’s athleticism, arm strength, and ability to make plays with his legs made him a dynamic quarterback to defend against. 
33 players are tied for the most wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 1 win. The first three are Patrick Mahomes on February 11, 2024, on February 12, 2023 and on February 2, 2020, Matthew Stafford on February 13, 2022 and Tom Brady 7 times. 
Newly retired legend Tom Brady leads the pack with a whopping 10 Super Bowl appearances and seven Super Bowl victories — winning six with the New England Patriots and a seventh with the 
Yes, the greatest QB of all time obviously holds the record for the most Super Bowl wins by a quarterback. Tom Brady, who won a majority of his Lombardi Trophies with the New England Patriots , holds a substantial lead over all others at his position. 
The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom Brady leads the pack with seven titles, three clear of any other quarterback, while  
A fourth Super Bowl win would tie Mahomes with Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the second-most Super Bowl wins by a quarterback. Mahomes' 17 postseason wins are already the  
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles  
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
At present, he is one of eight NFL starting quarterbacks to win back-to-back Super Bowls. Below is the full list to accomplish that feat: Bart Starr, Green Bay Packers (Super Bowls 1 and 2) 
Manning has two Super Bowl wins. The Giants won Super Bowl 42 over the Patriots during the 2007-08 season, and they also won Super Bowl 46 over the Patriots during the 2011-12 season with Manning  
Tom Brady’s seven Super Bowl wins are the most among any quarterbacks — and all players — in NFL history. Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana are both tied for second all-time among starting quarterbacks with four Super Bowl victories. With Brady’s retirement, Patrick Mahomes is the active leader for most Super Bowls among quarterbacks. 
In 2023, the Chiefs reached the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, securing Mahomes his second Lombardi Trophy. Currently positioned as the primary contender to Tom Brady’s seven titles, Mahomes has an opportunity to win his third Super Bowl on February 11, 2024, when the Chiefs take on San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII. 
Editor’s note: This post has been updated with new information. With the 2025 Super Bowl on the way, we’ll soon know if a new NFL quarterback will join the eternal list of Super Bowl champions.
