The first Super Bowl Gatorade bath came in 1987 at Super Bowl XXI. Near the end of the fourth quarter, CBS producers were instructing cameramen to keep an eye on the Giants bench and Gatorade  
According to The Athletic, guessing the color of the Gatorade poured over the winning coach's head is one of the most popular prop bets. The good people at Oddsshark have done a fine job tracking the history of Gatorade Showers at Super Bowls. There’s been one nearly every year since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001. 
Splashing the winning Super Bowl coach with Gatorade has become more than a fun tradition. Guessing the color has become a prop bet that generates more than $1 million, although the wager is

One of the most popular Super Bowl bets is the color of the Gatorade that gets poured on the winning coach. Here is a brief history on years past. 
Soon, almost every Super Bowl-winning team was dousing their head coach — so much so, that online sportsbooks began accepting wagers on the color of the sports drink. And four decades later, its one of the most common Super Bowl wagers every year. 
Sportsbooks were quick to recognize that money could be made beyond the games themselves, and in 2019, FanDuel became the first to offer fans a chance to bet on the color of the Super Bowl Gatorade shower. In five years of betting, blue Gatorade has been the most common color, winning three times. 
Odds for the Super Bowl Gatorade color prop came out on January 28, with Purple opening as the favorite at +250 odds. If you look at the recent trends below, it should come as no surprise that purple was the favorite, since it was used each of the last two years by the Chiefs.

Guessing the color of the Gatorade is not the only non-game specific moment fans can bet on at the Super Bowl. Other landmark moments are the coin toss at the start of the game, the length of the  
Gatorade Bath. Betting on the color of the Gatorade shower given to the winning coach has become a popular novelty wager. Orange has been the most frequently chosen color in past Super Bowls, but blue has been the selection for the last two championships.
