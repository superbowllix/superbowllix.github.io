        <h2><strong>super bowl janet jackson reddit usher super bowl yeah song</strong></h2>
        <p>I will say though that I didn't realize it until very recently how Janet Jackson was blacklisted because of it and that's total bullshit. I thought 99% of people besides crazy evangelicals just didn't give a shit and it was just a "LOL yeah I guess that happened" trivia thing, but turns out the CBS CEO was a giant fucking dick about it. 
The Super Bowl was always weirdly conventional, but the commercials were all weirdly edgy. Two years earlier, there was that Coor’s Light Superbowl commercial that was a parody of Tom T Hall’s “I Love (Little Baby Ducks)” but the punchline is having threesome with twins (because lesbianism and incest are comparable, and both acceptable  
Janet would’ve become even more HUGE after the Super Bowl. Of course, the black listing would haven’t happened as well, so her albums from 00’s and beyond would’ve got so much MORE attention and success. 
The half time shows at Super Bowls have grown more and more spectacular over the years, and Super Bowl XXXVIII topped them all. As Justin Timberlake sang "Rock Your Body" onstage with Janet  
But that’s exactly how FCC chairman Michael Powell described the 2004 halftime show. Specifically the portion of the show that featured Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and the wardrobe malfunction seen around the world. The show’s other acts (yes, there were other performers) Kid Rock, P. Diddy and Nelly, all escaped Powell’s ire. 
The Super Bowl Incident Put Janet Jackson In The Headlines For The Wrong Reasons When Jackson performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004, Justin Timberlake ripped off a piece of her costume. Jackson reacted with shock and later said that while Timberlake was supposed to tear off the piece, she wasn't supposed to be exposed. 
The impressive musical lineup included Janet Jackson, Kid Rock, P. Diddy, Nelly, and Justin Timberlake in Houston. As the halftime extravaganza reached its peak, Jackson and Timberlake turned up the heat with a rendition of Timberlake's 2003 smash hit, Rock Your Body, but Timberlake accidentally yanked off a piece of Jackson's costume  
The nation responded by making the Super Bowl the most-watched show once again, as if nothing unsavory had happened. Corporations paid more than $1 million for a 30-second commercial back then. 
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple  
It was Timberlake, after all, who along with Janet Jackson at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show gave birth to the phrase “wardrobe malfunction’’ and together were embroiled in “Nipplegate 
Do you really think Janet Jackson, a black woman in America, and 30+ year TV/entertainment veteran, woke up one morning and truly thought that exposing her breast on live TV would be received with love and adoration to boost her career? (Which by the way, was never failing. You don't get invited to do the Super Bowl if you're a has-been.) 
Generally I don't need to be convinced that people are willing to shit on women for anything sexual. But Janet Jackson was almost 40 at the time and her sales and popularity peaked in the early 90's. She didn't plateau after the Super Bowl issue. She continued slowly tailing off like she had been doing for the prior decade and like most pop  
I mean, up to that point, the super bowl halftime show was a PG affair. Parents can't be on defcon alert 24/7 and watching TV at home just might be one of those instances when you lower your guard. Reply reply 
An older lady had invited us over to have a super bowl party and watch the game on her big screen. When that happened the youth pastor just covered his face with his hands and ran out of the room lol 
Janet Jackson was and still is one of the best performers that ever existed on pop history and she got hurt really bad by what happend. What I feel is that a mistake happend with two persons on a national television event and only one got their career affect by that. 
“On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
Another thing people forget is that Janet Jackson had been famous for at least eighteen years at at the time of the Super Bowl. She released Control in 1986 and the Super Bowl occurred in 2004. I remember her career being a little on the decline at this point. I never stopped letting Janet be a megastar.

Well, the Super Bowl was always looked at as a family viewing occasion. No one expected her to have her top ripped off. It was apart of the lyrics to Justin Timberlake's song, but no one expected anyone to actually "have you naked by the end of this song". So, it was unexpected. People were upset because kids watch the Super Bowl. </p>
