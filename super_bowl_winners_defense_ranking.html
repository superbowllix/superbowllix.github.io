        <h2><strong>super bowl winners defense ranking score in super bowl now</strong></h2>
        <p>Until about 1999, the Super Bowl winner was more likely to have a better avg PPG ranking for offense and defense than post-1999. 23 of 30 SB winners from 1970–99 averaged a top 5 rank. For those 30 years, the avg SB winner was ranked 4.2, compared to teams being ranked 8.1 since 2000. 
The number 1 ranked defense has won the Superbowl %28.57 of the time while the number 1 offense has only won the Superbowl %20.41 of the time, and only twice (1972 Dolphins and the 1996 Packers) has a Superbowl winner been ranked first in both offense and defense. The average defensive rank for a Superbowl winner is 5.63 while the average  
Their top-tier Super Bowl defense regressed to 11th in '06, and Big Ben finished with 18 touchdown passes and a league-high 23 interceptions. Pittsburgh started 2-6 and could not recover in an 8-8

defensive ranking of last super bowl winners . Sun, Feb 11, 2024 . 49ers. 22 . Chiefs. 25 . Final.  What are the most rushing yards by a player in the Super Bowl? 
There are cases where a defense was badly ranked during the regular season and played great in the playoffs, same thing with offenses. This is just to give a better general idea of where those teams stood through the season. Teams that won with balance. 14 of the last 25 Super Bowl winners were top 10 in both offense and defense. 
The number 1 ranked defense has won the Superbowl 28.3% of the time while the number 1 offense has only won the Superbowl 18.87% of the time, and only twice (1972 Dolphins and the 1996 Packers) has a Superbowl winner been ranked first in both offense and defense. 
Until about 1999, the Super Bowl winner was more likely to have a better avg PPG ranking for offense and defense than post-1999. 23 of 30 SB winners from 1970-99 averaged a top 5 rank. For those 30 years, the avg SB winner was ranked 4.2, compared to teams being ranked 8.1 since 2000. 
How to rank Super Bowl winners? Let us count the ways. There are so many measures by which we can look at past champions and rank their quality. Why not make it as objective as possible? 
The only team to go 15-1 and fail to win a playoff game, these Packers fielded a much better squad in their Super Bowl title defense than the 10-6 team that became champion. 
The only team to go 15-1 and fail to win a playoff game, these Packers fielded a much better squad in their Super Bowl title defense than the 10-6 team that became champion. 
The average offensive ranking of the past 20 Super Bowl champions is 8.4, with the average defensive ranking being 8.2. In order to assess the significance of this slight difference in mean offensive and defensive ranking, I conducted a t-test which resulted in a p-value of 0.45. 
Below are the rankings (in terms of PFF grades) for the past 10 Super Bowl winners, starting with the Peyton Manning-led Colts in 2006. *Regular-season grade ranking shown for each team. After aggregating PFF’s data from the past decade of Super Bowl champions, there are a few things we can take away and apply to this upcoming season.

While we have been a bit reluctant to rank one-sided teams high on the list of Super Bowl winners, the 1985 Bears somewhat unfairly have that moniker due to their historic defense, which certainly ranks up among the best ever in NFL history. </p>
