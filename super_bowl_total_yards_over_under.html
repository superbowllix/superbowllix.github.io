        <h2><strong>super bowl total yards over under eagles super bowl wins by year</strong></h2>
        <p>The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
The Eagles won their most recent battle in late 2023, winning a 21-17 squeaker that hit the Under. However, the Over has hit in four of their last six matchups, including Super Bowl 57, which saw  
The Chiefs advanced to their third straight Super Bowl with a cover as 1-point home favorites in a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game Sunday as the Over (49) hit. QB Patrick Mahomes was 18-of-26 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD, while adding 2 more TDs on the ground as he rushed for 43 yards on 11 carries. 
For OVER/UNDER bets, a total point threshold is set, such as the 49.5 total point mark for Super Bowl LIX. Bettors predict whether the combined score of both teams will be OVER or UNDER this number. The UNDER has hit in five of the last six Super Bowls. 
Sporting News dives into the over/under for Super Bowl 57, analyzing key stats and trends to help bettors figure out if the Chiefs and Eagles will go over or under the projected total. 
The San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs were the last two NFL teams standing for this NFL season. Like past Super Bowl Sundays, one of the big decisions bettors have to make is will the final score be over or under 47.5 points. 
Four: Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and Eagles' Jalen Hurts both started under center in Super Bowl LVII. Hurts had a stellar game, throwing for 304 yards and a score, while running for 70 yards and  
This year’s Over/Under opened at 47 — the lowest Super Bowl total since Super  who notched over 2,000 all-purpose yards and two 1,000-yard pass catchers in Brandon Aiyuk and George Kittle  
This year’s Super Bowl will be a rematch of Super Bowl 54 back in February 2020, when the Kansas City Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers. As you can see, the Chiefs were narrow favorites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, and this time, the Niners are favored by just about the same margin, with the spread sitting at -1.5 in their favor. 
Here's what to know about the latest over/under point total and odds for Super Bowl 58. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. 58 greatest Super Bowl moments  
The Sporting News breaks down Saquon Barkley's player props for Super Bowl 59 between the Eagles and Chiefs, serving up the best bets for his rushing yards over/under, anytime touchdown prop and more. 
Doug Clawson: Patrick Mahomes rush yards over 28.5 (-110): Mahomes relies on his legs a lot more in the playoffs and he has gone over that number (29, 33, 41, 66) in all four career Super Bowl  
The Field for Super Bowl MVP, along with several other player props for the Chiefs QB.  (bet $10 to win $20.20 total) Under 36.5: -132 (bet $10 to win $17.58 total)  (bet $10 to win $18.77  
Those are in line with his 2024 numbers, too. The Chiefs allowed the 7th-most rushing yards to QBs this year. Chiefs Defense Super Bowl Stats. 62. The total tackle projections in the Underdog Fantasy Pick'em lobby are Nick Bolton (8.5), Drue Tranquill (8.5), Justin Reid (6.5), Trent McDuffie (4.5), Jaden Hicks (3.5). 63. 
The over/under for his passing yards in Super Bowl 59 is set around 200.5 yards at most sportsbooks. Hurts averaged 219.5 passing yards per game during the 2024 regular season. He has gone over 200 passing yards in 12 of 17 games this season. The Chiefs’ defense allowed an average of 216.3 passing yards per game in the regular season. 
In the Eagles and Chiefs’ combined six indoor games this season, the longest-made field goal was 47 yards. I like the Under 47.5 yards with more extra points and chip shot field goals likely deciding this Super Bowl. Pick: Longest Made FG – Under 47.5 yards (-125) Super Bowl 59 Race to X Points Odds
