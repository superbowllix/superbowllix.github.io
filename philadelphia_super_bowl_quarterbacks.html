        <h2><strong>philadelphia super bowl quarterbacks super bowl 2025 free streaming canada</strong></h2>
        <p>Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have been led to the Super Bowl by Jalen Hurts. Every QB the Eagles have had has not been as successful as their current one. A look at the quarterbacks who started the most games each season for Philly since the Super Bowl began. 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
Jalen Hurts, a second-round pick in the 2020 draft, became the starting quarterback in 2021 and helped lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl appearance in the 2022 season. Home / Eagles History Schedule 
Donovan McNabb, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl XXXIX: 357 Joe Montana, San Francisco 49ers , Super Bowl XXIII: 357 Tom Brady, New England Patriots, Super Bowl XXXVIII: 354 
Before securing its spot this season, Philadelphia's last Super Bowl appearance was in Super Bowl 57, at the end of the 2022 season. Only the 49ers have won the NFC since. With the Eagles making  
Starting quarterbacks for past 10 Super Bowl-winning teams • 70% Win (110-25-1)  years to come was the performance of quarterback Nick Foles of the Philadelphia Eagles during Super Bowl LII  
Philadelphia Eagles. 1. LII. 1. Matthew Stafford. Los Angeles Rams. 1. LVI. 0. The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom Brady  
Foles completed 72.6% of his passes for 971 yards, six touchdowns, one interception, and a 115.7 passer rating in the postseason to lead Philadelphia to a Super Bowl title. In Super Bowl 52, Foles  
The Eagles entered Super Bowl LII as 5.5-point underdogs to the Patriots, who were attempting to go back-to-back as champions. But that didn’t seem to phase Philadelphia. 
Super Bowl LVII will go to No. 1 or No. 15. Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes are set to square off in a historic Super Bowl quarterback matchup when the Philadelphia Eagles face the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
After Gannon, four quarterbacks sit at No. 2 on the list of most interceptions thrown in a Super Bowl: Kerry Collins (XXXV), Drew Bledsoe (XXXI), Jim Kelly (XXVI) and Craig Morton (XII) all threw

The Super Bowl 59 showdown will be a rematch of Super Bowl 57 where Kansas City defeated Philadelphia. That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs’ current championship streak. 
Super Bowl Wins by the Eagles. While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
Which quarterbacks have been benched in the Super Bowl? Along with Eason and Morton, Earl Morrall was also sent to the bench in a Super Bowl. Morrall had replaced Johnny Unitas during the 1968 season and put together an MVP year with the Baltimore Colts. 
Won Super Bowl 41-33 vs. New England Patriots. Offensive Coordinator: Frank Reich. Defensive Coordinator: Jim Schwartz. Other Notable Asst.: John DeFilippo (Quarterbacks), Ken Flajole (Linebackers), Mike Groh (Wide Receivers), Press Taylor (Off. Quality Control/Asst. Quarterbacks) and Cory Undlin (Defensive Backs) Stadium: Lincoln Financial Field </p>
