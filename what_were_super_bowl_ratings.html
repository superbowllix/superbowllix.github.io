        <h2><strong>what were super bowl ratings super bowl game time this year</strong></h2>
        <p>In contrast with previous years, Super Bowl IV's ratings were largely underestimated. Overnight Nielsen ratings gave the 1970 game a 38.8 rating and a 70 share, with 57 million total viewers; final numbers gave the game a 39.4 rating, 69 share, and 59.2 million total viewers. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
9. Super Bowl XLVII – 108,693,000 average viewership; 10. Super Bowl XLIV – 106,476,000 average viewership; Super Bowls XLVII and XLIV were aired on CBS, while Super Bowls XLV and LI were aired on FOX. NBC aired Super Bowl XLVI. The 10th most-watched Super Bowl featured the New Orleans Saints defeating the Indianapolis Colts 31-17. 
Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched program in television history, with an average of 123.7 million viewers tuning in to the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win versus the 49ers. 
Super Bowl television ratings and shares, including network (both NBC and CBS televised the first Super Bowl). The rating represents the percentage of televisions tuned in to a program. The share is the percentage of televisions on at the time that watched: 
There's a new Super Bowl TV ratings record, as an average of 120.3 million viewers tuned in on CBS to watch the Chiefs beat the 49ers. 
The audience for Super Bowl LVIII was so large that it approached the all-time most watched television broadcast in the United States set in 1969, when an estimated 125 to 150 million viewers  
Super Bowl LVIII was set up for ratings success from the very beginning—with the Kansas City Chiefs defending their championship title against the San Francisco 49ers; Swift flying across the  
Women accounted for 47.5% of the overall audience, up from 46.7% last year. (Per the New York Post, that 47.5% mark is a new record for the Super Bowl.) There were 4.4 million additional female viewers than last year, compared to 3.0 million additional male viewers. Super Bowl 58 demographic breakdown 
(Nielsen began including out-of-home viewing in their ratings service in September 2020. Sports Media Watch said, unofficially, the 2017 Super Bowl overtime game Patriots-Falcons had averaged 124.  
The home markets for both teams were both hugely invested in the Super Bowl (unsurprisingly). Household ratings showed Kansas City recording a 52.0 rating/87 share and Philadelphia at 46.3/77  
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of  
That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
In the past three years, according to research by marketing professor Kim Whitler, the number of Super Bowl ads that have had male-only celebrities has declined by 26% compared with a similar  
The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. The NFL playoffs averaged 38.5 million viewers during the first three weekends, a 9% increase over last year. 
The Super Bowl also drew a 41.6 rating, which beat out last year's Super Bowl by a small margin. A rating is the percentage of viewers with a TV who were watching the game. 
What does that mean for this year's Super Bowl ratings?  The Wild Card Round saw a 6% decline, the Divisional Round dropped 7%, and the Conference Championships were down 9% compared to 2024. 
Fans in the Boston market were as interested in watching Brady in the Super Bowl as ever. The rating in Boston was 57.6, according to Sports Business Journal, which is the second best Super Bowl  </p>
