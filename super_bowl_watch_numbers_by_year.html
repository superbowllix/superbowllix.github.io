Last year, the Super Bowl received a 42.1 TV rating, which means that 42.1 percent of households tuned into the game. While that number is high, it wasn't the highest in Super Bowl history. 
The longest Super Bowl game will also go down as the most-watched program in U.S. television history. According to Nielsen and Adobe Analytics, Kansas City’s 25-22 overtime victory over San Francisco averaged 123.7 million viewers across television and streaming platforms.
