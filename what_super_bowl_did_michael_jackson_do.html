        <p>The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show took place on January 31, 1993, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, as part of Super Bowl XXVII. In an effort to increase its profile after being counterprogrammed by an In Living Color special the previous year, the show featured a performance by Michael Jackson.

On this date in 1993, Michael made his historic Super Bowl in which he performed a medley of his hits, and closed the performance with “Heal The World,” which included an elaborate stunt in which the entire crowd turned over cards to reveal giant cartoons of children holding hands. 
The show began with James Earl Jones’ voice introducing an “unprecedented Super Bowl spectacular starring Michael Jackson”.
