The Chiefs (15-2), who beat San Francisco in overtime in last year's Super Bowl, are eyeing their fifth Lombardi Trophy at the 2025 Super Bowl. Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith was limited in  
Super Bowl LI (2017) was the first to go to overtime, while the second was Super Bowl LVIII (2024). The NFL uses different overtime rules during the regular season and the playoffs. 
The upcoming Super Bowl is a rematch of two years ago, when the Chiefs edged the Eagles 38-35 in Glendale, Arizona. Last year, Kansas City beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime in Las Vegas. 
The last Eagles/Chiefs Super Bowl was the 'Kelce Bowl.' Mahomes and Hurts also became the 1st Black quarterbacks to start against each other in Super Bowl history.  25-22 in overtime. In 2023  
In the wake of the Chiefs’ 25-22 win over the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII, much of the talk since has been about the playoff overtime rules. We finally got to see those rules, which passed in March of 2022, in action for the first time in Las Vegas on Sunday night. 
Which was the first Super Bowl game to go to overtime? Just one of the first 56 Super Bowls of all time went into overtime. The New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in Super

One of the biggest criticisms of the NFL’s overtime rule pre-2023 was that the overtime period represented a much different game than the previous 60 minutes did. From 2010 to '22, there were 11  
Picking the Chiefs to lose a close game is a dicey proposition. Heading into the Super Bowl, the Chiefs have won 17 straight games decided by a single score, a streak that includes last year’s overtime win in Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers. 
Odds as of February 3rd at BetMGM. Chiefs vs Eagles Super Bowl 59 Picks. Chiefs -1.5 (-110) at BetMGM. Patrick Mahomes has been an NFL starter for seven seasons, and the worst finish of his career is losing in overtime in the AFC Championship game. 
Total Sacks in game: Under 5.5 (-145, Caesars): The Chiefs and Eagles combined for two total sacks last Super Bowl. Eagles first drive to include a 10+ yard rush  Will there be overtime? 
This comes as no surprise, as the 49ers lost to Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in overtime in the Super Bowl just last year.  Some Eagles fans envisioned Deebo in the slot next season, playing

The Super Bowl 59 matchup is set and it’s sure to be one heck of a showdown as the Kansas City Chiefs, on the cusp of a historic three-peat, take on the rampant Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans. The Chiefs bested the Eagles 2 years ago in an overtime thriller and will aim to use that mental edge again here. 
These teams met in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium two years ago. Kansas City won 38-35 on a late Harrison Butker field goal after rallying from a 10-point halftime deficit. Eagles
