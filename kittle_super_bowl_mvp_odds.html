        <p>In 11 career playoff games, Kittle stayed under 47.5 receiving yards in eight of them, including in Super Bowl 54 against the Kansas City Chiefs when he was held to four receptions for 36 yards.

Super Bowl MVP odds . For Kelce and Kittle, if we were to decide not to bet on them, it wouldn’t be because their odds are unfavorable. In fact, you can make an argument that Kelce is one of the best value bets on the entire board at +1200. If it isn’t Mahomes winning SB MVP, you’d think it’s Kelce. Kittle has a tougher path but is

The individual talents of players like Deebo Samuel (+2000 odds), Brandon Aiyuk (+4500 odds), and George Kittle (+7000 odds) arguably damaged Purdy's potential in-season MVP case, making it hard to give him full credit for his incredibly efficient production. But the 49ers' threat density could work in his favor as a single-game MVP candidate.
