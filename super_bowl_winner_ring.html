Bling, bling: The first Super Bowl rings were awarded to the Green Bay Packers, winners of Super Bowl I in 1967. Each was designed by coach Lombardi alongside Jostens and featured a single diamond.

The largest Super Bowl ring ever produced is a size 25 (the average size for a non-athlete male is 10), for William “Refrigerator” Perry, who won Super Bowl XX with the Chicago Bears in 1986. 
The New England Patriots, winners of Super Bowl XLIV, celebrated their victory with a Super Bowl ring that broke all records. Some 205 diamonds weighing 4.85 carats glittered in the NFL championship dazzler (the Patriot’s 2003 Super Bowl ring had 104 diamonds; the 2004 Super Bowl ring had 124 diamonds). 
He won six rings with the Patriots during their run of success in the 2000s and 2010s with wins in Super Bowls 36, 38, 39, 49, 51 and 53. He added a record seventh title in Super Bowl 55 with the  
The Hall of Famer was part of 5 Super Bowl wins in a span of 8 years. This includes winning three out of four years in the early 90s with the Dallas Cowboys. Joey Thuney joined the list after the 2023 season when the Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII. That gives Thuney four Super Bowl rings (2 with Chiefs, 2 with Patriots). 
Between 1971 and 1979, Staubach made it to five Super Bowls – no other Heisman winner has made it to more than two. He won MVP his first time with 119 yards passing and two touchdowns in Dallas' 24-3 win. Staubach's second Super Bowl win, however, was the more impressive one because of his age and injuries. 
One year, former Louisville football quarterback Lamar Jackson will win a Super Bowl. And that will be worth more than all of his MVPs combined.  Jackson’s run to rack up MVP awards will ring  
Super Bowl I 1966: Green Bay Packers. Bart Starr, QB Designed by Packers coach Vince Lombardi and teammates Willie Davis and Bob Skoronski, Starr was beyond proud of his Super Bowl I ring.

Super Bowl rings’ history dates back to the first Super Bowl occurrence, Super Bowl I, where inaugural winners, Green Bay Packers, were awarded the single one-carat diamond ring. However, the tradition of championship rings traces to baseball in 1922, when the New York Giants won the 1922 World Series.

Both quarterbacks have won two rings.  2016 was the last time a Heisman winner made the Super Bowl behind Cam Newton’s MVP season. This year could see 2008 winner, Mark Ingram, join this list  
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
Winning three rings is impressive, but that’s just from Kansas City. Spags also won another ring earlier in his career as the defensive coordinator for the New York Giants, where he guided his defense to one of the greatest performances in Super Bowl history, holding the undefeated New England Patriots to just 14 points. </p>
