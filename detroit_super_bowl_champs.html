        <h2><strong>detroit super bowl champs super bowl parade live stream</strong></h2>
        <p>There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. The first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, so Detroit's championships do not count as Super Bowl  
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. The closest they came to winning a Super Bowl was in 1991 and 2023 when they lost the Conference Championship. Detroit Lions Pages 
Detroit: Michigan: Feb 6, 2005: XXXIX (39) New England Patriots: 24:  More Super Bowl Pages. Super Bowl History. Super Bowl Leaders; Super Bowl Standings; Welcome  
The Lions won four NFL Championship Games between 1935 and 1957. Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
In the Super Bowl era, the Lions have made three appearances in the NFC Championship Game: the 1991 season (lost to Washington) and the 2023 season (lost to San Fransisco). What Is the Lions’ Super Bowl Record? The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. 
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. The Lions also lost the 1954 NFL Championship in their quest for a three-peat. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, the Detroit Lions have won the NFL Championship 4 times, most recently in the 1957 season. 
The last championship was in 1957, nine seasons before the first Super Bowl. Hall of Famer Dutch Clark, who had an interception, 70 rushing yards, and a touchdown, led the Lions to a win over the  
Perhaps saying the Lions have never reached the Super Bowl is unfair, as they did reach and win several NFL Championship games prior to 1966. Detroit was crowned NFL champs in 1935, 1952, 1953 and 1957, although in those times, the two regular-season conference champions, Eastern and Western, automatically faced off in the championship game. 
The Super Bowl Drought. Since then, the Lions have had no championship or title. This is one of the longest droughts across all four major American sports. 66 years in the making, the Detroit Lions are poised to hang a banner up at Ford Field this season and capture their first-ever Super Bowl title. 
The Super Bowl XL rings were produced by the Minneapolis-based jewelry company Jostens, which is the primary supplier of Super Bowl champion rings and has made 31 rings in the Super Bowl's 50-year history through 2017. [84] 
By Justin Stulpe. The Detroit Lions are poised to make history this season, and it is time to believe the hype. Through the combination of strong leadership, a potent and explosive offense and a defense hitting its stride, the Lions are on the brink of unchartered territory in franchise history, aiming to win their first Super Bowl, and first pro football championship since 1957. 
4-1 in pre-Super Bowl championships: Detroit does have championship history in football, but it has been 67 years. The Lions won their first championship in 1935 over the New York Giants. 
A Super Bowl LII champion with the Eagles, Sproles rushed for 3,552 yards and 23 touchdowns in his career, though he may have been better known as a pass-catching back and returner.. He caught 553  
The result was familiar: The Chiefs won their 14th straight dating to last season, the longest streak since Carolina started 14-0 in 2014, and they became just the sixth Super Bowl champ to start
