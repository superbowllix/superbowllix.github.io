It might still be hard to believe 10 years later, but an undrafted rookie really made the play that saved the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX against the Seahawks. Saturday marked the 10-year  
Super Bowl XLIX between the Patriots and defending champion Seahawks on February 1, 2015 seemed to be the rare, evenly-matched Super Bowl, and what transpired on the field proved why. 
Malcolm Butler, New England Patriots, Super Bowl XLIX. Butler is the epitome of a Super Bowl Guy — he leaped from obscurity to immortality in one Super Bowl-clinching play. You know the play  
The Patriots' victory was their fourth overall and first since 2005's Super Bowl XXXIX, ending a 10-year championship drought.They finished the regular season with a 12–4 record en route to their eighth Super Bowl appearance, tying the record held by the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers, and sixth under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. 
See Additional Media. On February 1, 2015, the Seattle Seahawks lose Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots. The 28-24 loss is especially painful for the team and its fans because the Seahawks are just a yard away from scoring in the closing seconds, only to have victory elude them. 
It was smooth-sailing in Super Bowl XLVIII for the Seahawks, who handily obliterated the Denver Broncos in a dramatic 43-8 upset. The Seattle Seahawks returned again for Super Bowl XLIX, breaking the NFL’s 11-year drought in consecutive Super Bowl appearances by a single team. The 49th Super Bowl was perhaps one of the most dead-even [] 
The defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks looked to repeat, but it wasn’t an easy start. They began the season 3-3, but after that, they went 9-1 the rest of the way, including a six-game winning streak to end the regular season to finish first in the NFC West at 12-4. 
What quarterback has the most Super Bowl titles? Tom Brady’s seven Super Bowl titles are the most of any quarterback and player in NFL history. NFL Playoffs results from the last 10 years. 2024. Super Bowl LVIII: Chiefs (25) vs. 49ers (22) NFC Championship: 49ers (34) vs. Lions (31) AFC Championship: Chiefs (17) vs. Ravens (10) 2023 
Brady noted that the Super Bowl is a bit of an abnormality compared to most other games teams played in the Super Bowl, which played a hand in how he and his teams might have approached the game  
Dont’a Hightower, a linebacker, made a key stop for the New England Patriots in their 28-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX on Feb. 1, 2015; a pivotal sack in their 34-28  
Jason Marcum — Super Bowl XLIX.  sailed through the uprights to send New York to Super Bowl XXV and prevent the 49ers from attempting to become the only team to three-peat as a Super Bowl  
The Hall of Famer was part of 5 Super Bowl wins in a span of 8 years. This includes winning three out of four years in the early 90s with the Dallas Cowboys. Joey Thuney joined the list after the 2023 season when the Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII. That gives Thuney four Super Bowl rings (2 with Chiefs, 2 with Patriots). </p>
