The Chicago Bears have won the Super Bowl a single time, in the 1985 season. Additionally, the Chicago Bears have won the NFL Championship 6 times, most recently in the 1963 season. 
Super Bowl XX was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1985 season. 
III: The Bears taped "The Super Bowl Shuffle" at the Park West in Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 3, hours after landing in Chicago following their only loss of the season, a 38-24 defeat on Monday Night Football in Miami. Walter Payton and Jim McMahon taped their portions later via a green screen in a racquetball court at Halas Hall.

The Bears only have one Super Bowl victory, but their 1985 team that won it all is widely regarded as one of the best squads in NFL history. Led by legendary head coach Mike Ditka, Chicago lost just one game en route to Super Bowl XX. 
The Bears won Super Bowl XX, the first one they appeared in. That season was famous for the release of the "Super Bowl Shuffle," a quintessentially '80s rap song that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 immediately following Chicago's championship and is still talked about today. 
The Bears initially struggled but by Ditka's third season, Chicago had improved to 10-6 and reached the NFC Championship, where the Bears lost 23-0 to future Super Bowl champion San Francisco. The next season, Chicago had the franchise's best season to date, going 15-1 in the regular season and marching all the way to Super Bowl XX, where they  
On Jan. 26, 1986, the Bears defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, capping one of the greatest seasons in NFL history. On the 35th anniversary, we look at some of the players on that team then and find out what they've been up to since becoming world champions. 
The Bears won eight NFL Championships in the pre-Super Bowl era. Going back before they won the Lombardi in 1985, the Bears dominated the league for a few decades, but no run was more impressive  
Hester's touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did this went on to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in  
The Chicago Bears have appeared in the Super Bowl 2 times, in 1985 and 2006. How many Super Bowls have the Bears won? The Chicago Bears won the Super Bowl once, in 1985. 
On January 26, 1986, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Chicago Bears score a Super Bowl record number of points to defeat the New England Patriots, 46-10, and win their first championship since 1963  
The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. [192] The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout

Carpenters put up an orange letter “B” to read Bears over the “S” on the Sears Tower after the Chicago Bears won the Super Bowl, Jan. 27, 1986, in Chicago. 
Decades have since passed, and not only have the Bears not won another Super Bowl, but they’ve also struggled to achieve any form of sustained success. That can, and should, change in 2025. </p>
