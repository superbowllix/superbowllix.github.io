Had Warner been healthy all year, maybe the Rams return to the Super Bowl (as they did the next year) and go up against the great defense of the Ravens. 6. 49ers vs. Bills, 1988-1994. For seven straight years, ESPN personality and Buffalo native Chris Berman predicted a 49ers vs. Bills Super Bowl matchup, and it never happened. 
The Super Bowl is one of the greatest sporting events in NFL history. It matches the best NFL teams up against one another in a game viewed by millions each year 
Not good enough to be the greatest Super Bowl matchup that never happened, though. Below are the top 10 dream Super Bowls the world missed out on, based on a variety of factors -- I looked at top

Montana, of course, went on to win two more titles, while Marino never made it back to the Super Bowl during his 17-year Hall of Fame career. 8. Super Bowl XVIII: Los Angeles Raiders 38, Washington 9 
Miami vs. Chicago, Oakland vs Dallas, Minnesota vs. Denver - just a trio of Super Bowl matchups that may or not have been better games than what we ended up with. ;&lt;/p&gt;

Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda. Typically, that's the response you get when you talk about what could've been. But when it comes to these 20 Super Bowl matchups, there's no question they should've happened. 
With the NFL playoffs well underway and the AFC and NFC Championship Games mere days away, fans are more intrigued than ever to find out which two franchises will battle on the ultimate stage for  
I know this chart only says “Super Bowl era”, but the only playoff matches the Cardinals had pre-1970 were 2 games against the Eagles and 1 against the Packers. It’s absolutely insane how irrelevant the Cardinals have been outside of 2008 and 2015. 
I came in here excepting to see like historical Super Bowl match ups that everyone wanted too see but never got the chance too. Instead I got Bucs vs Steelers, Browns vs Vikings and something called the bird bowl featuring two NFC teams. What the fuck man.

This would have been a weird matchup that almost happened - Carolina vs Jacksonville in Super Bowl XXXI. Mentioning Super Bowl XXXI brings up the obvious one - Denver vs. Green Bay, although they met one year later.
