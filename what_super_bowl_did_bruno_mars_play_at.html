Grammy-award winner BRUNO MARS will perform at the PEPSI SUPER BOWL XLVIII HALFTIME SHOW on FOX in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ on Sunday, February 2, 2014, it was announced today. Bruno Mars is a critically acclaimed singer, songwriter, producer and musician. 
The last few halftime shows have basically been "who can do the most different thing." Loved the fact that Bruno Mars just focused on his performance and it was legitimately fun. Also, RHCP were supposed to be a cameo (Bruno requested they perform) but I doubt Pepsi wanted to advertise that, they just wanted as many viewers as possible. 
Bruno made history last night with the most watched Halftime Super Bowl show performance with a record breaking 115.3 million viewers. This has all been thanks to you, THE HOOLIGANS. Without you, none of this would have been possible. 
For much of the nation, the first two hours of Super Bowl 50 were nothing but pregame. When halftime finally came, it was on.  After Coldplay, Beyoncé and Bruno Mars finished their final song  
The allure of Super Bowl XLVIII is obvious for football fans, as the Seattle Seahawks and their No. 1 defense will face the Denver Broncos and their No. 1 offense.

Fast forward three years, and Bruno Mars is announced as the headliner of the 2014 Super Bowl. Unsurprisingly, many were sceptical. Since Michael Jackson turned the halftime show into the spectacle it is, the halftime performers have literally been living legends in their own right, consistently performing in stadiums for many years. </p>
