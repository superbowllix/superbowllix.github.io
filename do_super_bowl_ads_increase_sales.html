        <p>For example, Budweiser‘s sales revenue in the short run after the Super Bowl is about 15.75 percent higher per household than for their competitors, according to the research. “Budweiser‘s long-standing association with the Super Bowl is paying off during this peak sales period,” wrote the researchers. 
Winning ads and trends Growing ad revenues have made the average cost of a 30-second ad-spot skyrocket in the last two decades – leading to a seven-million-dollar price tag for Super Bowl 2024  
Super Bowl commercials have long been a cultural phenomenon, sparking conversations, laughter and even debate on social media in real time. But as technology and consumer habits evolve, so too do advertisers’ strategies. Michael Goldberg, a professor in the Department of Design and Innovation at Case Western Reserve University Weatherhead School of Management and the executive director of  
As the country finalizes preparations for Super Bowl LVIII, the impact of commercials on retail sales has become a topic of interest. The big question: Are they worth the money? According to an ad study completed in 2023 by Veylinx, a behavioral research company, Super Bowl commercials do indeed drive consumer demand. According to their results  
"It's not really a surprise to see that Super Bowl ads improve sales, but the short term bump alone may not be enough to justify the $7 million price tag," said Veylinx founder and CEO Anouar El Haji. 
20% increase in beer sales during the Super Bowl; Other studies point out that Super Bowl ads drive demand up by an average of 6%, increase online and social media interactions with the brand, raise share prices, and increase brand awareness (see graph and table below for more details). 
In 2024, a 30-second Super Bowl ad cost $7 million. With over 100 million viewers, companies use this platform to launch campaigns and boost brand visibility, betting on a significant return on investment. Although these ads have a high price tag, they often spike sales and interactions with each brand involved. 
Ad’s main KPIs: Brand awareness, household penetration, sales; Nerds centered its first-ever Super Bowl ad on its popular Gummy Clusters candy, which now makes up more than 80% of Nerds’ sales. The ad is part of a larger omnichannel campaign that Nerds began at the end of last year, Joey Rath, Nerds’ marketing director, told Modern Retail. 
The results show that 2024 Super Bowl advertising fueled a massive 16.4% increase in overall product demand among viewers, with Doritos Dinamita, Michelob Ultra and e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter  
The total word-of-mouth increases 22% the week after the Super Bowl. The impact on solely online word-of-mouth is much larger, but only lasts a few days. There is about a 68% increase on the day of the Super Bowl. “Overall, Super Bowl ads bring a big boost in word-of-mouth impressions, but it’s short-lived. 
Spice up the hot wings and buy some new fan gear: It’s almost time for Super Bowl LIII, and that means consumers are ready to start spending on the Big Game. According to the National Retail Federation, American consumers spent about $81 per person on Super Bowl-related items last year for a total of more than $15 billion. 
Specifically, Budweiser volume and revenues can increase up to 3.9 percent and 4.7 percent respectively in response to Super Bowl advertising during specific later weeks for a 10-point increase in  
The firm reached its Super Bowl conclusions through interviews with more than 1,000 consumers before and after they were exposed to the ads in the 2012 and 2013 games. 
The study design isn't assessing the correct data to come to the very broad conclusion that '80% of Super Bowl ads don't help sales'. Most of the Super Bowl ads I have seen have just been about brand building anyway, and the effect of brand building on consumer behaviour is only seen at its strongest in the long term, which this study isn't  
Previous research has determined that there really isn’t a boost in sales for brands after their Super Bowl ads air. A new university study, however, finds Super Bowl ads bring immediate spikes in online searches and word-of-mouth impressions, although short-lived. What payback should and shouldn’t marketers expect from Super Bowl ads? 
should see perennial Super Bowl advertisers exhibit a corresponding increase in their sales. We construct a panel data set consisting of nearly 200 media markets and 6 years of Super Bowl ratings and sales data from Nielsen. The relationship between Super Bowl viewership and the sales 
Coca-Cola, which the study identified as not having as strong of a connection to the Super Bowl as its competitor Pepsi, didn't see much of an increase in sales during Super Bowl week. However, ads do somewhat help sell Coke after the game among sports fans, the study found. 
According to a recent 1,000 person study conducted by the Tucson-based research firm Communicus 80% of Super Bowl ads do not achieve sales for their brands. But, the sponsors keep coming back and spending those dollars. 
According to Sports MONITOR data, two-thirds of all Americans plan to tune into this year’s game with 25% of Super Bowl viewers say they expect to pay more attention to the ads than the game itself” While Super Bowl ads offer a captive audience, promoting diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) in Super Bowl creative can deeply impact a  
In less than four hours, 65 commercials costing an average of $5.6 million per 30-second spot aired in front of 91.5 million Super Bowl LV viewers, according to the market-research firm Kantar Group. </p>
