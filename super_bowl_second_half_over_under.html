        <p>Super Bowl 57 Over/Under: Picks for betting the Chiefs-Eagles total  and both sides will try to run the ball more in the second half if they get out to a lead. In fact, these squads have led  
The Eagles won their most recent battle in late 2023, winning a 21-17 squeaker that hit the Under. However, the Over has hit in four of their last six matchups, including Super Bowl 57, which saw  
Zack Baun has averaged 8.66 tackles per game in the playoffs and 9.43 tackles per game in the regular season so I'm a bit confused why his tackles total is set at 10.5 juiced to the OVER for the  
Kansas City has hit the second-half Under in 18 out of 20 games this season. The Over 23.5 sits at -115 (bet $10 to win $18.70 total). The Under 23.5 is -105 (bet $10 to win $19.52 total). 
Understanding Super Bowl Point Spread &amp; Totals. The Super Bowl point spread is a handicap applied to create a more balanced betting field.

Super Bowl Point Spread My raw number for this game is San Francisco -2.8, so I show a tiny bit of value on San Francisco, but not enough to back the 49ers for the full game. 
The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53).

The biggest worry here is that in five 49ers games that finished under the first half total, the second half total is 3-2 to the over, including 1-1 in non-conference games. However, every other signal points to the under. In Chiefs games that finish under the first half total by at least half a point, the second half under is 5-1. 
The Chiefs opened as 1.5-point favorites against the Eagles for the Super Bowl, setting fans up for a rematch of Super Bowl 57.  (“over/under” in casual parlance) opened at 48.5 on BetMGM  
The Chiefs advanced to their third straight Super Bowl with a cover as 1-point home favorites in a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game Sunday as the Over (49) hit. QB Patrick Mahomes was 18-of-26 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD, while adding 2 more TDs on the ground as he rushed for 43 yards on 11 carries. 
In Super Bowl 58, the over/under is currently 47.5 points. To win a bet on the over, the 49ers and Chiefs must combine for 48 or more points. To win a bet on the under, the 49ers and Chiefs must
