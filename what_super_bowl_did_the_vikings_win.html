        <p>The Minnesota Vikings started playing in the NFL in 1961 before the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Since their creation, the Vikings as of 2022 have won at least three games in every regular season, excluding 1962, and are just one of seven teams to have been victorious in at least 15 regular season games. 
The Minnesota Vikings last lost the Super Bowl in the 1976 season. The Vikings lost to the Oakland Raiders by a score of 32-14. 
Minnesota Vikings (4) – appeared in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX, and XI; they won the NFL Championship in 1969, the last year before the AFL–NFL merger, but failed to win the subsequent Super Bowl. Buffalo Bills (4) – XXV , XXVI , XXVII , and XXVIII ; in 1964 and 1965 , they won the last two AFL Championships before the first Super Bowl in  
The Vikings have made four trips to the Super Bowl in their 57 years as a team.. Minnesota's first appearance in the Super Bowl was Super Bowl IV in 1970 when the Chiefs toppled the Vikings 23-7. 
In 2024, the Minnesota Vikings lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card Round. What years did the Vikings make the Super Bowl? The Minnesota Vikings have appeared in the Super Bowl 4 times, in 1969, 1973, 1974 and 1976. 
Ever since then, the Vikings have yet to qualify for another Super Bowl despite reaching the NFC Championship Game six more times. MORE: Minnesota Vikings Depth Chart. They most recently reached the conference championship game in 2017 but fell 38-7 to the Philadelphia Eagles, which went on to win Super Bowl 52 that season. 
Although the Vikings have failed to win any Super Bowl games, they have appeared in four games as of December 2024. Their first appearance was in the Super Bowl IV in 1970. 
No, they did not. The Minnesota Vikings played in four Super Bowls and lost all four.Super Bowl IV - Kansas City Chiefs (23-7)Super Bowl VIII - Miami Dolphins (24-7)Super Bowl IX - Pittsburgh Steelers (16-6)Super Bowl XI - Oakland Raiders (32-14) 
The Vikings are one of 12 NFL franchises to have not won a Super Bowl. However, they are tied with the Buffalo Bills with the most Super Bowl appearances despite never winning it all with four. Minnesota has not appeared in the Super Bowl since its last appearance in Super Bowl XI. In the 46 following seasons, the Vikings have gone 0-6 in

The Vikings have an all-time overall record of 537–438–11, [a] the highest regular season and combined winning percentage among NFL franchises who have not won a Super Bowl, in addition the most playoff runs, division titles, and (tied with the Buffalo Bills) Super Bowl appearances. 
The Minnesota Vikings have never won the Super Bowl. The Vikings have reached the Super Bowl a total of four times (1970, 1974, 1975, and 1977) but have never won. They are one of two teams in NFL history that have reached the Super Bowl four times without a win.

The Philadelphia Eagles completed an improbable run in the face of injuries to win Super Bowl LII.  The No. 2 seed Minnesota Vikings entered Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia with the NFC  
Thanks to Minnesota’s spiffy 20-14 record in the last two years, the Vikings surpassed the Patriots via win percentage since 1966, the dawn of the Super Bowl era. The NFL’s fourth-best regular season team in the last 58 years cannot win a Super Bowl. Hell, the Vikings haven’t even appeared in the big game since 1976. 
The Vikings had Atlanta beat in the 1999 NFC title game, and likely would've won the Super Bowl if it wasn't for one errant field goal. Gary Anderson hadn't missed all season. 
When Was the Last Time the Vikings Made the Super Bowl? Minnesota last went to a Super Bowl almost 50 years ago. In 1976, led by Rookie of the Year Sammy White and All-Pro Chuck Foreman, they made it to Super Bowl 11, their third Super Bowl appearance in four seasons, but lost in humiliating fashion to the Raiders 32-14. 
The Vikings squandered a 12-2 record the following year, giving up a lead to the Cowboys in the Division round. In 1976, Tarkenton, Foreman, and receiver Sammy White led the team to its fourth Super Bowl in eight seasons. Oakland scored the first 19 points in Super Bowl XI and the Raiders went on to win, 32-14. 
The 1969 Vikings won the final NFL Championship Game and advanced to play the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl IV 50 years ago this month.  The computer journeyed 25,000 miles during the 1969  
The Vikings really want to figure out if they can win a Super Bowl with Cousins at the helm, and O'Connell just might be the best coach to help them figure that out. </p>
