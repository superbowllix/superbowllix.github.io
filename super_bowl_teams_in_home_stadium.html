        <h2><strong>super bowl teams in home stadium super bowl first drive result</strong></h2>
        <p>In 2020, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were the first team in NFL history to perform in the Super Bowl at their home stadium. On Feb. 7, 2021, the Buccaneers bested the opposing Kansas City Chiefs 31-9

The Los Angeles Rams outlasted the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship to punch their ticket to Super Bowl LVI at Sofi Stadium two Sundays from now. 
A team has never played a Super Bowl game in their home stadium, but twice teams have played in their home area: In 1980, the Los Angeles Rams played in the Super Bowl in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, about 15 miles from their home stadium, and in 1985, the San Francisco 49ers played in Stanford Stadium, about 25 miles from their home stadium. 
Winning team and Losing team columns indicate the number of times that team has appeared in a Super Bowl as well as each respective teams' Super Bowl record to date. Venue column indicates number of times that stadium has hosted a Super Bowl. City column indicates number of times that metropolitan area has hosted a Super Bowl. 
In 58 editions of the Super Bowl, this phenomenon has only happened twice, and this gave rise to the “Super Bowl Curse”. The teams whose stadiums are picked for a Super Bowl usually miss the playoffs or are knocked out early in the postseason. No team whose stadium hosted the Super Bowl reached the Super Bowl until 2020. 
No Super Bowl team has played in their home stadium. The closest a Super Bowl team has been to playing at home was Super Bowl XIV when the Los Angeles Rams played the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California and Super Bowl XIX when the San Francisco 49ers played the Miami Dolphins at Stanford Stadium.

Although no team other than the Buccaneers has officially won the Super Bowl in their home stadium, the 49ers were victorious in Super Bowl XIX in January 1985 at the Stanford Stadium, home of  
Here's a list of all the cities to host the Super Bowl, with the results of those games: Super Bowls in New Orleans (11) SB 4: Kansas City 23, Minnesota 7 (Tulane Stadium)

The home-field curse is said to affect a team if the Super Bowl is played at its home stadium. As of 2024, only two teams have played the Super Bowl in their stadiums, the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs for Super Bowl LV and the 2021 Los Angeles Rams against the Cincinnati Bengals for Super Bowl LVI at their new home, SoFi Stadium; both host  
SoFi Stadium (/ ˈ s oʊ f aɪ / SOH-fy) [18] is a 70,240-seat sports and entertainment indoor-outdoor stadium in Inglewood, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.SoFi occupies the former site of the Hollywood Park Racetrack, 0.15 miles (0.24 km) southeast of the Kia Forum, 0.2 miles (0.32 km) northwest of Intuit Dome, and 3 miles (4.8 km) from Los Angeles International Airport. 
Only two teams have experienced a home Super Bowl, and both did it this decade:  Tampa Bay faced the Chiefs at their Raymond James Stadium in Super Bowl LV to conclude the 2020 campaign. The  
Super Bowl LV is at Raymond James Stadium -- where the Buccaneers play their home games -- making Tampa Bay the first team to play the Super Bowl in its home stadium in the 55 years the game has  
Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market but at a different venue than their home stadium: the Los Angeles Rams, who lost Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; and the 49ers, who won Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium instead of Candlestick Park, during a time when the league often picked a  
Where Is Super Bowl 58? Allegiant Stadium, the official home of the Las Vegas Raiders of the AFC West, is the location of Super Bowl 58. It will mark the first time Allegiant Stadium hosted football’s biggest game during the stadium’s existence since 2020. 
The Caesars Superdome has played host to seven Super Bowls before, making it the the most used venue in NFL Super Bowl history. Super Bowl 60 sees a record eighth NFL showpiece played at the state-of-the-art multi-sports stadium in New Orleans. Away from the Super Bowl, Caesars Superdome is the home stadium of NFL side the New Orleans Saints  
The Philadelphia Eagles will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. The team's will meet up again after squaring off two seasons ago in Super Bowl LVII, with the Chiefs beating the  
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are playing Super Bowl 55 in their home stadium, but that doesn't necessarily mean they get to be the home team for the game against the Chiefs. </p>
