        <p>A decade later, Joe Montana engineered the 49ers' 92-yard, game-winning drive as San Francisco won its Super Bowl rematch over the Bengals.. The second Eagles-Patriots Super Bowl was a classic, too. 
A rematch of the reigning conference champions concluded its script as the Super Bowl between them eight months ago did: with a Kansas City Chiefs win. 
That's obviously good news for the Chiefs, who are 1-0 in Super Bowl rematches after defeating the 49ers in last year's Super Bowl. Here's a ranking of each previous Super Bowl rematch, a list  
The stakes and the quality of play weren't at the same level as eight months ago when Mahomes and the Chiefs (6-0) beat the 49ers (3-4) 25-22 in overtime for their Super Bowl title in five seasons. 
For the Kansas City Chiefs, Sunday was a fairytale. The 2024 Super Bowl, which started 6:30 p.m. ET at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, was a rematch between the Chiefs and 49ers, who last met in  
Eight months after Super Bowl LVIII ended with a walk-off touchdown pass in overtime, the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers meet again — this time at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. 
The 49ers opened as a 2.5-point Super Bowl favorite over the Chiefs at DraftKings Sportsbook on Sunday night, but that line quickly fell to an even 1.0 in favor of the Niners. 
Kansas City Chiefs headed for Super Bowl rematch with San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas. In two weeks, the NFL's finale will kick off at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, February

When the 49ers meet the Chiefs this Sunday at Levi’s Stadium, it will mark the 10th time in the Super Bowl era that there will be a regular-season rematch of the previous season’s title bout  
Rematch: 1989 Super Bowl; 49ers won, 20-16; This is the longest gap between meetings on the list with the least carryover in key personnel as a result. Super Bowl 16 in 1982 marked the first  
First meeting: Chiefs 31, 49ers 20 (Super Bowl LIV) Rematch: In the second Super Bowl to reach overtime, Kansas City turned it into an all-time classic. The Chiefs won their third title in four  
The Ravens and 49ers have history on their side. No. 1 seeds are 34-14 in conference championship games, including 2-0 last season when the Chiefs went on to beat the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Home teams are 35-18 in the NFC title game, 36-17 in the AFC. If the 49ers and Chiefs advance, it’ll set up a Super Bowl rematch. 
The 49ers won't see many familiar faces on the defense of the Chiefs, which retains only defensive tackle Chris Jones and replaced 10 other starters on the crew that started Super Bowl LIV. 
The San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs don't have a primetime slot when they face off Sunday in a Super Bowl rematch. However, they will be playing on national television. According to 506

For just the 10th time in Super Bowl history, we'll have a rematch in the Big Game with the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles facing off in Super Bowl 2025 on Sunday, Feb. 9, at 6:30 p.m  
Eight months later, the pain of losing a second Super Bowl in five seasons to the Kansas City Chiefs has barely subsided for the San Francisco 49ers as they prepare for a rare regular-season rematch. 
Patrick Mahomes overcame two interceptions to deliver a few big plays with his feet and the Kansas City Chiefs remained the league’s only undefeated team after beating the San Francisco 49ers 28-18 in a Super Bowl rematch. 
Obviously, Chiefs-49ers is the Sunday night game because putting a Super Bowl rematch in that slot is the only thing that makes sense this week.OK, I don't know how to tell you guys this, but I'm  </p>
