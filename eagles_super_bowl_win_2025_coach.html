        <p>With innovative coaching staffs, dynamic playmakers, and championship pedigrees, this game promises to be an unforgettable showdown. Let’s just say both Super Bowl 2025 teams boast exceptional coaching staffs with significant NCAA experience and proven NFL success. Eagles Nick Sirianni (Head Coach) Current Pro Role: Head Coach, Philadelphia  
The harsh lessons learned from last season fueled the Eagles on their way to a 14-win regular season and three more wins in the playoffs. Team owner Jeffrey Lurie and general manager Howie Roseman declined to move on from Sirianni and the Eagles made the moves needed to bring them back to the top of the NFL — and they are one win away from reaching the pinnacle. 
The matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX is the ninth  be the first team to win a Super Bowl rematch between head coaches. Then again, so were the  
The Eagles were indeed flying high as the best in the NFL, boasting a 10-1 record with a No. 1 seed, home-field advantage in the playoffs, and yes, a Super Bowl ring all ahead as credible goals. 
The Eagles entered the season 11-1 to win the Super Bowl and +550 to win the NFC. They were tied for the second favorites to win the NFC entering the season with the Lions, trailing the 49ers (+260). 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are heading to Super Bowl LIX for a much-anticipated rematch. The Chiefs are just one win away from an unprecedented ‘three-peat’ after beating  
Hurts, Barkley each rush for 3 TDs to help Eagles reach Super Bowl with 55-23 win over Washington By DAN GELSTON AP Sports Writer Monday, January 27, 2025 1:17AM 
The Eagles (17-3) are aiming for their second Super Bowl title in five tries. Backup quarterback Nick Foles led them to a 41-33 victory over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots seven years ago. Foles presented owner Jeffrey Lurie with the Halas trophy. “We’re there to win it,” Lurie said about going back to the Super Bowl. 
Mailata’s ploy likely won’t work, though, as all signs point to the Saints keeping the 36-year-old Moore in New Orleans long after the Eagles face the Chiefs on Sunday in Super Bowl LIX. 
In 2022 he amassed a career-best 15½ sacks as the Chiefs won their second Super Bowl in four years. The next season he had 10½ as the Chiefs repeated as champions. 
The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will square off in the 2025 Super Bowl. Here are the latest predictions on who will win the big game. 
— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) February 4, 2025. Fangio’s Eagles allow just 18.3 points per game in the postseason, but they were nearly upset by the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Divisional Round. The win over the Rams is worth mentioning, given that quarterback Matthew Stafford, like Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, is a Super Bowl  
How ex-Detroit Lions center Dominic Raiola is having big impact on Super Bowl 2025.  Philadelphia Eagles win one this week. Eagles defensive ends/outside linebackers coach Jeremiah Washburn, an  
Eagles key offensive players. Jalen Hurts, QB - No. 53 pick in 2020 NFL Draft out of Oklahoma; Saquon Barkley, RB - No. 2 pick in 2018 NFL Draft out of Penn State by New York Giants; signed 3-year  
The Philadelphia Eagles have won one Super Bowl in franchise history. The Eagles were champions of the 2017 NFL season after beating the Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. Before the Super Bowl era, the Eagles won three NFL Championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA – FEBRUARY 03: Kellen Moore, offensive coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles, smiles during Super Bowl LIX Opening Night at Caesars Superdome on February 03, 2025 in New  
Just like 2023, the Eagles are headed to a Super Bowl game against the Kansas City Chiefs. And just like that matchup, Google trends data shows locals are fervently trying to figure out when the  
The answer might have something to do with the Chiefs being favored to win their third straight Super Bowl — and the color Gatorade they poured on Andy Reid after the last two. It was purple.
