        <p>The Chiefs are once again Super Bowl champions: Here are some of the scenes from their emotional celebration. From CNN Digital's Photo Team. 
2WHYB2P Las Vegas, United States. 11th Feb, 2024. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes celebrates after the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime to win Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, February 11, 2024. 
McManus's message seemed to work for most of Super Bowl LVIII, but it didn't seem to get through when it mattered most late in the game. While Romo's had many solid moments with strategy and  
Due to both its impact on popular culture and the high quality of football played on the field, Super Bowl LVIII earned its legacy as one of, if not, the greatest Super Bowls ever played. A stellar performance of 399 total yards and two touchdowns earned Mahomes his third Super Bowl MVP, tying Joe Montana for second-most all-time and trailing  
Super Bowl LVIII was a thrilling game to watch, writes sports historian Amy Bass, but the action was about far more than just the Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô defeat of the San Franscisco 49ers. Bass

Super Bowl LVIII brought viewers a rigmarole of emotions this Sunday.&amp;nbsp; As a lifetime Bills fan, I hated every second of it.&amp;nbsp; However, I must put my biases aside in order to give a rating of the final game of the 2024 NFL Playoffs fairly.&amp;nbsp; 
Super Bowl LVIII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2023 season.In a rematch of Super Bowl LIV from four years earlier, the American Football Conference (AFC) champion and defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers 25‚Äì22 in overtime. 
Chris Simms and Ahmed Fareed dive into Super Bowl LVIII tape to assess the San Francisco 49ers' offensive performance against Steve Spagnuolo and the Chiefs' 
‚ÄúWow!‚Äù That was the only word that could come out of my mouth when the Kansas City Chiefs won their second straight Super Bowl last Sunday. From a game that started out so boring with absolutely no offense from either team, to a game that was the best one in recent memory. It even had the same record broken twice in a single game! If you happened to miss this year's Super Bowl, then this  
I don‚Äôt know if Bill Hader‚Äôs Stefon character was necessarily the target audience for the Super Bowl LVIII halftime show, but the easiest way to review the Usher-centric performance would be  
Super Bowl LVIII halftime star Usher has everyone saying ‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù and then some after his Sunday-night performance. Though, to be fair, that man could‚Äôve danced his body rolls and pelvic thrusts all over the field without singing a word and I would still call it a success. 
That does tend to happen when you have 13 straight SB wins for the NFC in the 80s and 90s, though. There was a long time where the NFC Championship Game may as well have been the Super Bowl, since you'd literally have the 2 best teams (or more) all in the NFC.

Watching the Netflix series The Receivers is a reminder that NFL Films has yet to announce a release date for the home video of Super Bowl LVIII. It still appears the end of the home video market. When you have a budding dynasty, a team that brings in national ratings and the 49ers too . </p>
