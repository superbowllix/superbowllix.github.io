        <p>The World cup vs Super Bowl debate rages on,  In 2022 the USMNT’s group stage game vs. England had a record U.S. viewership of 19.9 million people tuning in across English and Spanish  
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
Super Bowl LVII — a down-to-the-wire thriller with plenty of storylines, much-anticipated commercials, and Rihanna’s hit parade of a halftime extravaganza — was watched by 113 million people  
Where to watch the FIFA World Cup in 2022: A guide on how to watch this year’s World Cup Football According to Nielsen , Super Bowl LVIII drew a record attendance of 123,714,000 through platforms such as CBS, Univision, Nickelodeon, and Nick-at-Nite. 
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
For comparison, the 2022 Super Bowl pulled in nearly 100 million viewers. When the Los Angeles Rams topped the Cincinnati Bengals, 99.18 million people were watching per Statista . 
According to Roadtrips.com five billion people watch the World Cup Final, while the Super Bowl is actually the 8th most-watched event with 115 million views. Finishing above NFL's showpiece are the Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, Women's World Cup, Olympic Games, Winter Games and the Champions League Final. 
FIFA has claimed that around 1.5 billion people watched the 2022 World Cup final on television. That is over a billion more than watched Super Bowl LVI. Robert Summerscales | Jan 18, 2023 
How many people watch Super Bowl around the world? The international numbers for the Super Bowl are impressive, though not typically comparable to other global sports phenomenas like the World Cup. 
Both the Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup have established themselves as iconic events with rich legacies that go beyond just the games themselves. The Super Bowl, which began in 1967, has grown into a cultural juggernaut in the United States. Over the years, it has become synonymous with American sports excellence and spectacle. 
A record 18,000 media credentials were issued for the World Cup in Qatar, according to FIFA. This weekend’s Super Bowl in Las Vegas will host over 6,000 credentialed members of the press.
