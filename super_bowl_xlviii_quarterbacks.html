        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Super Bowl XLVIII was the first Super Bowl held at an open-air stadium in a "cold-weather" city; previous Super Bowls in cold-weather cities were held at indoor stadiums. However, the temperature at kickoff was a mild 49 °F (9 °C), making this only the third-coldest Super Bowl. [37] A major snow storm hit the area the very next day. [38]

Super Bowl LIX is the 10th Super Bowl rematch in NFL history, but just the fourth rematch with the same quarterbacks. In the three occasions it has happened so far, Troy Aikman triumphed twice  
Mercedes-Benz Superdome following Super Bowl XLVII. This was the 49ers' second Super Bowl played at the Superdome—the first being Super Bowl XXIV when they beat the Denver Broncos 55–10. The 49ers, Broncos and New England Patriots are the only teams so far to play two or more Super Bowls at the Superdome. The 49ers also joined the Broncos  
He dazzled in Super Bowl LVII, totaling 35 touchdowns that season and rushing for an NFL-best 13 scores by a quarterback. Despite his heroic effort, the Eagles fell 38-35 to Mahomes’ Chiefs.

Today we have Super Bowl XLVIII, held on February 2, 2014, at Metlife Stadium in New Jersey between the two-time NFC champion Seattle Seahawks and the seven-time AFC champion Denver Broncos. As always, we have a pop quiz, and then homework at the end of the episode. 
The 49ers failed to get that sixth Super Bowl win that would have tied them with the Steelers for the most Super Bowls ever; they’d get another chance seven years later. Next time, we will have one of the weirdest routs in Super Bowl history, a game that brought the NFL back to the eighties, with the NFC dominating the AFC in brutal fashion.
