        <p>Which Heisman-Winning quarterbacks couldn’t win a Super Bowl?

Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
It wouldn’t take long for another Heisman-winning QB to become a Super Bowl champion. In 1980, Jim Plunkett led the Oakland Raiders to their second championship in franchise history. He was in his 9th year in the league, and was 10 years removed from being named the Heisman Trophy winner while playing for Stanford in 1970. 
Roger Staubach and Jim Plunkett are the only Heisman winners to win the Super Bowl multiple times. Both quarterbacks have won two rings. The Heisman was first awarded in 1935 but the first Super

The former Stanford quarterback was an aging star at the time, but managed to lead the Raiders to another Super Bowl win three years later. Cowboys QB Roger Staubach: 1972, 1978. Almost a whole decade separated Staubach's Heisman season at Navy and his first Super Bowl win. After serving time in Vietnam, Staubach terminated his naval commision

You won't believe how many Heisman Trophy winners have also won a Super Bowl in the NFL.  Carolina Panthers quarterback and 2010 Heisman winner out of Auburn, Cam Newton, was the last to have  
With a win in Super Bowl 50 on Sunday, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton can accomplish something done only three times before -- win the Heisman Trophy, win a college national title, and  
No Heisman winner has won a Super Bowl since Charles Woodson in Super Bowl XLV, although Burrow came within minutes of a ring last season in LVI. Overall, Heisman winners have appeared on Super Bowl rosters 27 times while a combined 10 Heisman winners have won a total of 12 Super Bowls (Roger Staubach and Jim Plunkett being the only repeat  
Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks who won the Super Bowl Jim Plunkett, Roger Staubach and John Huarte are the only three quarterbacks to win the Heisman Trophy and the Super Bowl. Also Read: 
The Heisman-related trivia question for the week is who was the last Heisman winner to win a Super Bowl and the answer, for the 13th straight year, is Charles Woodson. Woodson, while a member of the Green Bay Packers, earned his ring in 2011 at Super Bowl XLV. Lamar Jackson was the last Heisman winner [] 
Jim Plunkett, Oakland Raiders and Stanford The last Heisman winning QB that started and won a Super Bowl was Jim Plunkett who won the Heisman in 1970 (Stanford) and won Super Bowls XV and XVIII with the Raiders. The only other Heisman winning QB to start and win a Super Bowl was Roger Staubach who won the Heisman in 1963 (Navy) and won Super Bowls VI and XII with the Cowboys. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson (2016) and Tampa Bay Buccaneer signal-caller Baker Mayfield (2017) will lace ‘em up this weekend as both are trying to become the first Heisman Trophy winner to win a Super Bowl since Charles Woodson (1997) in Super Bowl XLV in 2011.

The intersection of Heisman Trophy winners and Super Bowl champions is a rare one, with only a select few achieving success at both levels of football glory.  both Heisman-winning quarterbacks  
2. Stanford University. They make athletes smarter at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, evidently. Two victorious alumni of the Stanford Cardinal have three Super Bowl rings between them: Former Denver Broncos star John Elway has two (Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII in 1997 and 1998, respectively), while Jim Plunkett also won two as the quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams in 1981 in
