Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes can win a fourth Super Bowl before turning 30. That opportunity is there when the Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59 at the Caesars  
Brady could've been on this list three separate times as he has won a Super Bowl at ages 39, 41, and his latest at age 43, making him the oldest player to ever win the Super Bowl. The seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback has racked up more Super Bowl wins than any franchise has in history.
