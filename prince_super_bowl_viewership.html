        <h2><strong>prince super bowl viewership super bowl 2025 halftime show her</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl halftime show draws millions of eyeballs, both during and after the game. We dove into the YouTube numbers to determine whose Halftime Show performance is the one true viewership GOAT. You may have been a sucker for Lady Gaga allegedly base-jumping off the scoreboard in Houston. 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl

Most-Watched Super Bowl Halftime Shows Since 2011 Some of music's biggest names have headlined Super Bowls, from Michael Jackson, whose 1993 set spurred over 133 million viewers to tune in, to Prince, whose 2007 spectacle garnered an estimated 140 million TV viewers. 
Performed live before 75,000 people, broadcast to 140 million more viewers at home, and racking up a production cost of $12 million dollars, Prince’s Super Bowl halftime performance was one of the biggest shows of his life. 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
At the time of this performance, it set a Super Bowl halftime show record of 114 million viewers. Madonna was also the most searched term on Google during the game. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
The stage was shaped like the symbol that replaced his name and 140 million TV viewers saw Prince perform live at Super Bowl XLI.According to Billboard magazine, it was the greatest Super Bowl  
They would return to sponsoring halftime shows with Super Bowl XLVII. [5] After having, in the past, been uninterested in performing in a Super Bowl halftime show, in 2006, Prince expressed interest. [6] Executives that were in charge of booking an act for the halftime show visited Prince in Los Angeles. [6] 
The most-watched Super Bowl Halftime Show is Michael Jackson’s iconic 1993 set at Super Bowl XXVII, drawing a reported 133.4 million American viewers. Before Jackson, the Halftime Show was largely uneventful and featured less appealing acts. 
In one for the ages, legendary prankster John Hargrave orchestrated an ambitious “commercial” during Prince’s Super Bowl XLI halftime show. John and his team of comedians breached one of the strictest security details in the world to distribute 2,350 LED necklaces to sections of the audience with instructions to activate the blue lights  
But the notoriously cheesy “Winter Magic” spectacle at the 1992 Super Bowl in Minneapolis was a turning point in the NFL’s strategy for maintaining TV viewership during the long mid-game break.

The Super Bowl may be the big game, but its halftime show is the real showstopper. Once a simple intermission, it has transformed into an electrifying spectacle with megastars like Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna, Beyoncé, and Rihanna, commanding the stage.
