        <h2><strong>super bowl ratings vs world cup super bowl viewers vs champions league</strong></h2>
        <p>The massive viewership numbers of the World Cup and Super Bowl pad the coffers of FIFA and the NFL respectively. FIFA has turned a profit of nearly $5 billion or more from the last three World Cups. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
The Super Bowl isn’t going to become the most-watched sporting event on Earth, and the FIFA World Cup — nor anything else — is likely going to oust the NFL title game from its domestic throne. 
[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets

The FIFA World Cup Final in 2018, which featured young phenom Kylian Mbappe and France defeating Croatia by a thrilling score of 4-2, had 3.57 billion viewers, per FIFA. For comparison, the 2022  
World Cup. A worldwide sporting event that is played only every 4 years; Brings together different cultures from all over the world; For many fans, has a deeper significance that transcends mere sport; Isn't as big a TV advertising event as the Super Bowl; Super Bowl. A championship finals series; Comprised only of American football teams from  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
More than 2.5 million people watched the 2023 Super Bowl in Brazil, making it the country with the most viewers in South America. China was the country outside of the Americas with the largest  
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
Yes: Super Bowl viewership might exceed World Cup viewership on a single game basis, but World Cup viewership will be in the billions by 2026. Three North American countries, a new format, lots of  
The World Cup has competitors from almost every nation on earth, that's why it's every 4 years due to the length of qualifying to actually be one of the 36 teams competing in the final stages. To get to the superbowl you just have to buy a franchise, move it to a new city then compete for 5 months and a bit against some of the 32 teams to win

Super Bowl Sunday is an unofficial national holiday, with parties, family gatherings, and special events taking place across the country. 
According to Roadtrips.com five billion people watch the World Cup Final, while the Super Bowl is actually the 8th most-watched event with 115 million views. Finishing above NFL's showpiece are the Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, Women's World Cup, Olympic Games, Winter Games and the Champions League Final. 
It’s official: more people in the US are streaming the World Cup than this year’s Superbowl, so it’s no surprise sports channel ESPN this week reported a 46% increase in viewership in group  
Last season’s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals, also on NBC, had a reported viewership of 208 million in the United States alone.. The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar  
The 2018 World Cup in Russia generated $5 billion – about $78 million per game. In 2021-22, the NFL brought in $17 billion, roughly $63.4 million per game. Super Bowl vs. FIFA World Cup Final Prestige. Is it the Super Bowl or the FIFA World Cup Final that carries more glory and honor for the winners? 
Peyton Manning won his second Super Bowl behind a tough Broncos defense. The average viewership number for this Super Bowl was 112,336,000. The air date for Super Bowl 50 was on February 7, 2016. 4.
