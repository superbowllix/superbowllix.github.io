        <h2><strong>what super bowl did jets win kendrick lamar super bowl old</strong></h2>
        <p>The Jets have won one Super Bowl in their only Super Bowl appearance. They won Super Bowl III in 1969 against the Baltimore Colts, who were the strong favorites to win the game. 
Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker in official marketing; the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were retroactively applied to the first two games. [4] A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. [5] 
The Jets have not played in the Super Bowl since the merger, losing the AFC Championship Game in the 1982, 1998, 2009 and 2010 seasons. [72] On the other hand, the Colts won Super Bowl V (1970), then after relocating to Indianapolis, won Super Bowl XLI (2006) and lost Super Bowl XLIV (2009). [73] [74] 
As heavy underdogs at Super Bowl III, the Jets represented the AFL with distinction as they defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts. The Jets became the first AFL team to defeat an NFL team in their combined championship game. When was the last New York Jets Super Bowl win? As noted, the Jets have been in just one Super Bowl, which they won in 1969. 
The New York Jets last won the Super Bowl in the 1968 season. The Jets beat the Baltimore Colts 16-7 in the Super Bowl. 
The New York Jets last played a home playoff game on Jan 4, 2003, nearly 23 years ago, when they hosted the Colts in the Wild Card Round of the 2002 NFL playoffs, in which the Jets scored a 41-0 win. When was the last time the Jets lost a playoff game? 
The New York Jets claim just 1 Super Bowl title over the heavily-favored Baltimore Colts (later the Indianapolis Colts) in 1969.[1] However, this was during the NFL Championships 1966-1969 (Super Bowl era-pre merger) thus before the 1970 AFL--NFL merger. But Super Bowl III in 1969 was the 1st Super Bowl that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker at the time of the game.[2]1. Read more: new-york  
Days earlier, Jets quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed a victory by New York, an 18-point underdog. The win was the first in the Super Bowl for the AFL, which merged with the NFL for the 1970 season.

Namath running a play for the New York Jets in Super Bowl III in 1969. The high point of Namath's career was his performance in the Jets' 16–7 win over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in January 1969, shortly before the AFL–NFL merger. 
January 12th, 1969: Football’s New York Jets beat the Baltimore Colts to win Super Bowl III, fulfilling an unlikely prediction made by Jets quarterback Joe Namath. 
The New York Jets, led by quarterback Joe Namath, rocked the sports world and the country on Jan. 12, 1969, by becoming the first American Football League team to defeat an NFL team with their 16-7 Super Bowl III victory over the heavily favored Baltimore Colts at Miami's Orange Bowl. 
On January 12, 1969, 75,389 football fans nationwide piled into the Miami Orange Bowl down in sunny Miami, Florida — the same stadium used in Super Bowl II. Attendees at Super Bowl III paid an average of $12 (worth $85.11 in today’s money) for a game ticket, with the stadium packed to capacity before kickoff. 
Besides all that, Namath is a superb quarterback who in the Super Bowl last week proved that his talent is as big as his mouth—which makes it a very big talent, indeed. He went from Broadway Joe to Super Joe on a cloud-covered afternoon in Miami, whipping the Baltimore Colts, champions of the National Football League, 16-7 in the process. 
The Jets were in such complete command, Namath did not have to throw a single pass in the fourth quarter. He simply ran out the clock. The Jets brought the AFL its first Super Bowl victory and the stature needed to validate the merger of the two leagues, which was agreed upon in 1966 and finally completed in 1970. 
The New York Jets defeating the then-Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III remains the biggest upset in Super Bowl history. The Colts were 18-point favorites before getting stunned by Broadway Joe  
In 1969, a few days before his team took the field as huge underdogs in the Super Bowl, New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath — known then and forever as Broadway Joe — arrived at a Miami hotel  </p>
