        <p>From viewership trends to fan opinions, we analyzed key Super Bowl statistics using results from a recent survey we conducted with 1,000 U.S. respondents. Here’s what we found. Top Super Bowl 2025 Statistics: 58% of people are excited to watch the 2025 Super Bowl; 39% of respondents want the Philadelphia Eagles to win, but only 30% think they

Super Bowl viewership has fluctuated over the years but increased by about 26% from 2021 to 2024, while the U.S. resident population increased steadily year over year.

We predict 116.8 million viewers to tune into the big game day. You heard it here first - PredictHQ machine learning models have released their predicted viewership for the Super Bowl. With 116.8 million viewers combined with $76.2 million in local spending for New Orleans, the 2025 Super Bowl LIX is expected to set records. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Fox will air this year's Super Bowl and has "a chance" to deliver the most watched audience ever, said NFL Chief Media and Business Officer Brian Rolapp. 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl

NFL recorded an international viewership of 62.5 million in 2023 for the Super Bowl. This figure excluded the domestic viewership of 123.4 million viewers in the United States. Of the recorded international viewers in 2023, 24.1 million viewers were from Mexico, the highest viewership recorded since the game began and a 5% increase compared to  
Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). 
But beyond the touchdowns, halftime performances, and record-breaking TV ratings, the game is a billion-dollar business juggernaut. And for Super Bowl LIX, set to go down in New Orleans on February 9, 2025, the economic impact will be as electrifying as the action on the field. New Orleans’ Big Win 
More than 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all-or-part of Super Bowl LVIII across all networks, the highest unduplicated total audience in history and up +10% versus last year's Super Bowl (183.6 million). Univision averaged more than 2.2 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network.

The Super Bowl LVII attained a TV rating of 40.0, with a total number of viewers exceeding 115 million in 2023. This was a massive improvement from its all-time low rating of 36.9 in 2022. The approximate figure of 115.1 million viewers consists of those who watched the event across digital streaming services, FOX, and Fox Deportes.
