        <p>Do Winners of the Super Bowl Get Paid Extra? It’s true: Winners of every Super Bowl also make an extra paycheck and receive a unique ring for that game. In terms of the paycheck, it’s substantial. The winner of Super Bowl LIX will receive a bonus worth $171,000. The loser will receive $96,000. 
How much money will the Super Bowl winners and losers get? The most recent collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and the NFL was struck in 2020. It states that each member of the winning team will receive $171,000 for winning the 2025 Super Bowl. 
The 2023 Super Bowl winners earned $164,000, while members of the winning team in 2022 received $157,000—so you can see it goes up a bit each year. This year's cash bonus is up more than $40,000 from 2020, when the winners of the Super Bowl each took home $130,000. 
What is the 2025 NFL Super Bowl prize money? Following the agreement between the NFL and NFL Players Association (NFLPA), the Super Bowl winners will receive $171,000 as prize money. The runner-up will receive $96,000. Apart from the fun and thrills, the next aspect of the Super Bowl is the monetary reward, which always turns out to be lucrative.

Under the NFL's current collective bargaining agreement (Article 37, Section 5), each player on the winning team in Super Bowl 59 will receive a bonus of $171,000. That's a $7,000 increase over  
Winning the Super Bowl is the dream of every NFL player – and doing so will net those victorious a hefty payday thanks to the prize money on the line. While lifting the Vince Lombardi trophy is the goal in the 59th edition of the Super Bowl this Sunday, players can rest assured that they’ll be rewarded financially win or lose in the New  
The bonus associated with playing in the Super Bowl grows each year, according to the agreement. Last year the winners’ bonus was $157,000. Next year, it’s set to rise to $171,000. By the 2030-31 football season (the last seasons covered in the most recent bargaining agreement), the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000. 
Back in the first Super Bowl, the winner was paid $15,000, and the loser $7,500. However, when adjusted for inflation, that equates to roughly $117,000 and $59,000 in 2022. Therefore, the change in pay for playing in or winning the Super Bowl has not increased so substantially over the years relative to the current market. 
The Kansas City Chiefs wrapped up their second consecutive Super Bowl win on Sunday, taking down the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas. Now that the party in Sin City is over and the parade back  
Way back on Feb. 14, 2024 — shortly after K.C.’s 25-22 win over San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII — a DraftKings Sportsbook customer put $22,000 on Chiefs +650 to win Super Bowl LIX. 
As in the Pro Bowl Games, Super Bowl LVIII includes a monetary incentive to win, although the $171,000 for winners and $96,000 for losers is a departure from the NFL’s usual twice-as-much payday
