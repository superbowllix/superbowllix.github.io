        <p>On the Monday after the incident at Super Bowl Sunday, CBS had Jackson release a written statement apologizing, taking full blame for what they were now calling an unfortunate “accident”. “The decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. 
The Super Bowl was always weirdly conventional, but the commercials were all weirdly edgy. Two years earlier, there was that Coor’s Light Superbowl commercial that was a parody of Tom T Hall’s “I Love (Little Baby Ducks)” but the punchline is having threesome with twins (because lesbianism and incest are comparable, and both acceptable  
JT didnt defend Janet, and did what he does best: play good boy by crying about it, bringing his mother on red carpets to appear wholesome, and screwed yet another pop princess by being shitty. His apology to Janet was a DECADE plus late. 
Jackson's performance was considered to be revolutionary, with it being the first time that the Super Bowl's ratings jumped during halftime and into the second half. 3. Dr. 
The Super Bowl and especially its halftime show are the most-watched event on TV. That's the place to make amends for overreacting in 2004.  Janet Jackson at the halftime show of the Super Bowl  
Janet Jackson, Beyoncé and Rihanna gave us unforgettable Super Bowl halftime moments: Look back in photos at the stars and their performances Yahoo News Photo Staff February 6, 2025 at 8:00 AM 
The NFL played it safe after the Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake controversy in 2004 and went with former Beatle Paul McCartney to perform solo at the Super Bowl XXXIX Halftime Show at Alltel  
Despite feeling as though he had been thrown under the bus by the press a decade earlier, Michael Jackson did publicly address the Super Bowl halftime show scandal in the aftermath of the incident. Speaking to Fox News' Geraldo Rivera in 2005, Michael said he gave Janet Jackson some words of advice after the incident. 
But that’s exactly how FCC chairman Michael Powell described the 2004 halftime show. Specifically the portion of the show that featured Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and the wardrobe malfunction seen around the world. The show’s other acts (yes, there were other performers) Kid Rock, P. Diddy and Nelly, all escaped Powell’s ire. 
That moment during Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 when Justin Timberlake grabbed part of Janet Jackson’s top and tore it off, scarring children worldwide who discovered that human anatomy includes  
“On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
I mean, up to that point, the super bowl halftime show was a PG affair. Parents can't be on defcon alert 24/7 and watching TV at home just might be one of those instances when you lower your guard. Reply reply 
TIL after Janet Jackson's incident at the Super Bowl halftime show, Viacom retaliated by keeping her music off their properties including MTV, VH1, and radio stations. They also rescinded her invitation to the Grammys. Justin Timberlake was still allowed to go and actually picked up some awards. 
I've never seen anyone make an argument about Janet Jackson not being specifically in the Super Bowl LII Halftime Show due to sexism.. The most common argument I have seen however is Justin Timberlake, the person who actually exposed Janet Jackson's breast on live television, being allowed to come back 14 years later, while Janet Jackson, the victim, is more or less blackballed due to a double  
TIL that YouTube was invented out of frustration that there wasn't a single platform to watch Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction following the now-infamous Super Bowl Halftime performance 
TIL that the term “wardrobe malfunction” was coined in 2004. Justin Timberlake first used it in an apology to Janet Jackson for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, where Jackson’s breast was exposed. Media began using the term, and eventually it was added to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary. 
Yep. And that we are still talking about it now, fifteen years later, is a testament to the insanely good marketing of it. I doubt the layman can remember who played who during that super bowl, but everyone remembers the time everyone got to see Janet Jackson's boobie.

For the longest time, I never would’ve thought that the Super Bowl 2004 halftime show with Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake would had shifted the culture from the raunchy early 2000s to the more conservative mid 2000s. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it did changed everything. 
This is rather ironic because playing the Super Bowl Halftime show is considered one of the pinnacles of a pop star’s career. This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). </p>
