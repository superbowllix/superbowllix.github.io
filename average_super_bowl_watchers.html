        <h2><strong>average super bowl watchers super bowl zeitraum</strong></h2>
        <p>From 2017-20, Nielsen measured out-of-home viewing separately. Adding in the out-of-home audience during those years, Patriots-Falcons in 2017 is the most-watched Super Bowl on record with 123.94 million, followed by this year’s game and Eagles-Patriots in 2018 (117.33M). 
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. 
About 75% of people aged 18-34 watch the Super Bowl and just over half (54%) of viewers are men. But the NFL isn’t just a young person’s game. More than 60% of adults aged 65+ tuned in to the 
The overtime thriller between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs drew a combined average household rating of 43.5, and combined household share of 83. In total, year-over-year viewership was up 7.4% from 2023. 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
The 2024 edition of the Super Bowl, which saw the Kansas City Chiefs emerge victorious against the San Francisco 49ers was watched by over 123 million viewers in the United States, making it 
The longest Super Bowl game will also go down as the most-watched program in U.S. television history. According to Nielsen and Adobe Analytics, Kansas City’s 25-22 overtime victory over San Francisco on Sunday night averaged 123.7 million viewers across television and streaming platforms. 
Approximately 200 million viewers -- 60% of all people in the United States -- watched Super Bowl LVII on Feb. 12. 
Last year's Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles drew 115 million viewers, the largest number since the epic New England Patriots-Seattle Seahawks slugfest in 
NEW YORK – February 14, 2023 –An estimated 113.06 million viewers were tuned in for Super Bowl LVII on Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The Super Bowl LVII telecast ran from 6:44 PM ET to 10:14 PM ET and averaged nearly 112.2 million viewers on FOX. 
Across the 18 categories in Table 9, the average index (214.6) is more than twice that for Super Bowl watchers—those making no purchases index lower at 95.6. More frequently purchased products, such as groceries and pet supplies, are indexed somewhat lower than less frequently purchased products, such as appliances and sporting goods. 
Football’s average age of its viewers was at 50. That’s better. It’s still not the NBA (42) or soccer (39). A 1.5-year median age jump in one year for the Super Bowl should be a slight concern. After all, just staying at the same rate should make the average median age 48.7. No league wants to be associated with an aging fanbase. 
Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). 
The Pepsi Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show averaged 103.4 million viewers from 8:15 to 8:30 p.m. ET, and Telemundo's first-ever Spanish-language Super Bowl broadcast averaged 1.9 million sets of eyeballs.

Even more viewers showed up for Rihanna's performance in the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, which drew an average of 118.7 million viewers across TV and digital platforms, per FOX. 
NEW ORLEANS -- Blame Chiefs fatigue or a simple matter of supply and demand, but ticket prices for Super Bowl LIX are down sharply ahead of Sunday's game. StubHub reported that as of Wednesday  
3 in 5 consumers plan to watch Super Bowl LVIII, and most plan to do so in the comfort of their own homes.  Compared to the average consumer, those who watch or attend NFL games are 10% more
