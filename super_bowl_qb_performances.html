        <p>Completions: 22 for 25, 268 yards, three touchdowns Quarterback rating: 150.9. Simms’ performance against the Broncos was the single-most efficient game in Super Bowl history. 
Joe Montana’s Super Bowl QB performance in 1990 is the best of all time because his stat sheet combined both of what made Young and Simms’ games so memorable. The Super Bowl XXIV MVP had an  
Following Mahomes' performance in Sunday night's 25-22 overtime win over the 49ers, we've decided to come up with a ranking of the top quarterback performances in Super Bowl history. This was the  
The best Super Bowl performance by a quarterback we have ever seen belongs to Rodgers in his one and only appearance — and it’s not even close. Rodgers had a 94.2 passing grade in his Super Bowl 45 victory over Pittsburgh and gathered up nine big-time throws while going without a single turnover-worthy play. 
That game did not earn a spot among the top 25 performances from a quarterback in the Super Bowl, but Brady did top this list with four appearances. Three quarterbacks—Brady, Montana and Kurt

Ryan put forth the greatest quarterback performance in a losing effort in Super Bowl history, staking Atlanta to a 28-3 lead midway through the third quarter. The Falcons’ defense completely fell apart from there, and the offense sputtered, with Ryan losing a fumble and taking a crucial late sack to push Atlanta out of field goal range on a  
In all, there have been 10 performances where players have recorded 30 or more completions in a Super Bowl: 1. Tom Brady, New England Patriots , Super Bowl LI: 43 
What is the record for completions in a Super Bowl? Tom Brady and Peyton Manning dominate this list. They have five of the top 10 performances in terms of completions, though there is a key difference between the two – Brady’s three appearances on the list all came in wins against the Atlanta Falcons (No. 1), Seattle Seahawks (No. 2) and Carolina Panthers (tied for No. 4), while Manning  
Throughout the first 56 Super Bowls in NFL history, there have been plenty of incredible performances from the men under center. From Hall of Famers like Tom Brady and Joe Montana to unprecedented heroes like Nick Foles and Joe Flacco, the Super Bowl often brings out the best in players. 
Either way, there have been several quarterback performances in Super Bowl history that are memorable for all the wrong reasons. 24/7 New York news stream: Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are. 
49ers QB Steve Young had six passing touchdowns in a 49-26 rout over the Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX. He had four touchdowns in the first half, and the game got so far out of reach that 49ers  
Joe Montana’s Super Bowl QB performance in 1990 is the best of all time because his stat sheet combined both of what made Young and Simms’ games so memorable. The Super Bowl XXIV MVP had an  
It's one of those plays that's been immortalized in NFL history, but also an all-time performance that deserves recognition on this list. 8. Eli Manning, QB, New York Giants (Super Bowl XLII) 
Malcolm Smith, a seventh-round pick who never received another major accolade in his 11-year career, was the Super Bowl XLVIII MVP as a linebacker after a sensational performance for the Seattle Seahawks. Before Super Bowl LIX kicks off, let's take a look at the 10 most iconic Super Bowl MVP performances in the history of the game. 
Tom Brady: Super Bowl LII. Charles LeClaire-Imagn Images. Tom Brady set a Super Bowl record by throwing for 505 yards in Super Bowl LII (he’s the only QB to surpass the 500-yard mark) while completing 28 of the 48 passes he threw for an average of 10.8 yards. 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
Patrick Mahomes has established himself as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history before even turning 30.. The 29-year-old Mahomes will play in his mind-boggling fifth Super Bowl in the  
Super Bowl XLII (win) Stats: 19-of-34, 255 yards, 2 passing touchdowns, 1 interception. Won Super Bowl MVP. 24. Roger Staubach, Dallas Cowboys </p>
