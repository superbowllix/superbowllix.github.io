The Giants had their second Super Bowl win, 20-19. Hostetler had a Super Bowl victory after coming off the bench late in the season. Anderson had the MVP award; it was revealed that Thurman Thomas was going to be named MVP should Norwood have made that field goal. The Giants held the ball for over 40 minutes, a Super Bowl record. 
Super Bowl XXV was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Buffalo Bills and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion New York Giants to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1990 season. The Giants defeated the Bills by the score of 20–19, winning their second ever Super Bowl. It is the only Super Bowl decided by one  
Collins had a passer rating for the game of only 7.1, the second worst in Super Bowl history, [32] threw four interceptions (tying a Super Bowl record that has since been surpassed by Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon's five interceptions in Super Bowl XXXVII) and completed only 15 of 39 passes for 112 yards.

Super Bowl XXXV (or Super Bowl 35) was a Super Bowl game between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Giants in the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2000 regular season. The Ravens won against the Giants 34–7. The game was played on January 28, 2001 at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The win gave the Ravens their  
Game summary of the New York Giants vs. Buffalo Bills NFL game, final score 20-19, from January 27, 1991 on ESPN. 
They beat Denver 21-3 in the wild card round, division champion Tennessee 24-10 in the divisional round, and Oakland 16-3 in the AFC Championship Game. They were headed to the Super Bowl for the first time as a franchise; the NFL considers the Ravens a separate entity from the Cleveland Browns, who still have never gone to a Super Bowl. 
The Super Bowl XXXV halftime show, titled "The Kings of Rock and Pop" took place on January 28, 2001 at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, as part of Super Bowl XXXV.

The $125 average ticket cost for the previous Super Bowl lasted a single season, with fans spending an additional $25 ($150 total) for a ticket to Super Bowl XXV (valued at $286.65 today). Now about five months into the Gulf War, American football fans across the country were more spirited than ever, a fact only highlighted by Whitney Houston
