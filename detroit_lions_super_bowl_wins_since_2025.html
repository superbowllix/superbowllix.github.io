        <p>The Detroit Lions last played a home playoff game on Jan 18, 2025, when they hosted the Commanders in the Divisional Round of the 2024 NFL playoffs, in which the Lions suffered a 31-45 loss. When was the last time the Lions lost a playoff game? 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. 
Ever since the Super Bowl became the biggest stage in American sports in 1967, the Lions have not had the best history. However, change has come in Detroit and it warrants a deeper look. To begin, it took the Lions three years to make their first Super Bowl playoff appearance in 1970. 
The Lions are one of 12 NFL teams that do not have any Super Bowl wins in franchise history. Yet while Detroit does not have a Super Bowl to its name, the franchise has won an NFL championship. 
The Lions famously had only one playoff win since that 1957 title — until last season, when they won twice: a 24-23 thriller over the Los Angeles Rams and 31-23 victory over the Tampa Bay  
The Detroit Lions are one of the oldest franchises in NFL history, as they have been in the league since 1930. However, despite the fact that they’re coming up on a century in the NFL, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. It’s worth noting that the Lions did win four NFL Championships, but these predated the Super Bowl era, which began in  
The Detroit Lions have made the playoffs 19 times in a franchise’s history that dates back to 1930 when they started as the Portsmouth Spartans. Since the merger in 1970, the Lions have made the playoffs 14 times. 
With a renowned and difficult past in the NFL, the Detroit Lions as a franchise appeared back in 1930; however, since then, they have never appeared in a Super Bowl since their formation in 1967 or recorded any meaningful playoff success since the 1991 season's NFC Championship game. They recently garnered attention again at the [] 
Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
Detroit Lions must win 3 games in NFL playoffs 2025 to win the franchise's first-ever Super Bowl.  Can Lions win Super Bowl? Yes, they can since they are one of 14 teams to make the 2024-25 NFL  
Before the Lions have to worry about 2025, the franchise has Super Bowl aspirations to pursue. As the No. 1 seed in the NFC, the team will enjoy a bye during the Wild Card weekend. They’ll welcome the conference’s lowest-remaining seed to Ford Field in two weeks because the league reseeds between rounds. 
The Lions (12-2) lost for the first time in exactly three months — when they also lost at home to Tampa Bay, 20-16, in Week 2 on Sept. 15 — and had their franchise-record 11-game win streak  
The wait begins for the Detroit Lions.. The Lions clinched the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs after pulling away to handle the Minnesota Vikings 31-9 on Sunday night.With the win, the Lions finished 15-2 and atop the NFC standings to earn a first-round bye and homefield advantage until Super Bowl 2025. 
The Detroit Lions finished the regular season 15-2, tied with this year’s Kansas City Chiefs for the best record since the NFL expanded to a 17-game regular season for the 2021 season. 
The good news for the Lions is that general manager Brad Holmes is still in Detroit and isn't afraid to take big swings to upgrade key parts of the team's roster. With that in mind, here's what a seven-round mock draft could look like for the Lions prior to addressing any needs in free agency. Lions 2025 NFL MOck Draft

The Detroit Lions fell short of their lofty Super Bowl-or-bust expectations in 2024. In case you’ve been living under a rock, they suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Washington  
Free Press sports writer Dave Birkett highlights the best and worst performances of the Detroit Lions’ 48-42 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday at Ford Field.. The Lions (12-2) lost for the first time in exactly three months — when they also lost at home to Tampa Bay, 20-16, in Week 2 on Sept. 15 — and had their franchise-record 11-game win streak snapped. 
The Detroit Lions finished the regular season 15-2, tied with this year’s Kansas City Chiefs for the best record since the NFL expanded to a 17-game regular season for the 2021 season.
