        <h2><strong>how many super bowl games went into ot super bowl prop bets non football</strong></h2>
        <p>Only one Super Bowl game has gone into overtime since the inception of the NFL. That game is one of the greatest comebacks in Super Bowl history, with the New England Patriots defeating the  
Super Bowl LI: The infamous “28–3” game. Super Bowl LI saw the Atlanta Falcons take a 28–9 lead into the fourth quarter over the New England Patriots, only for the Patriots to score 19  
This game is also legendary because it remains the only Super Bowl that went to overtime. Here's a look at how the New England Patriots made NFL history with their win in Super Bowl LI. 70% Win 
Just one of the first 56 Super Bowls of all time went into overtime. The New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in Super Bowl LI after coming back from a 25-point deficit. 
Kansas City and San Francisco were tied 19-19 to send Super Bowl into overtime .  In the first 56 Super Bowls, though, only one went into overtime, when the New England Patriots rallied from  
Prior to Sunday, only one Super Bowl had gone to overtime: the New England Patriots' 34-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. Better known as the 28-3 game. COMEBACK COMPLETE. 
Four Super Bowls have nearly gone to overtime, but were decided by field goals in the final 10 seconds of the game. They include: Super Bowl V: Jim O’Brien kicked a field goal with five seconds  
The Patriots beat the Falcons in Super Bowl LI and the Chiefs beat the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. Super Bowl Overtime Rules. Super Bowl overtime rules are the same as NFL playoff overtime rules: Both teams have the opportunity to possess the football. If the game is tied after each team’s possession, the next score wins. 
Only one other Super Bowl has ever gone into overtime in the 58-year history of game. That Super Bowl 51 in 2017. That game is famous as it featured the New England Patriots' 28-34 comeback to  
Super Bowl 51: The only overtime game in history. Five years ago, the Patriots and Falcons met in Super Bowl 51. Yep. It’s that Super Bowl. The one known simply by a score: 28-3. The odds of any Super Bowl going to overtime are slim. You can bet the game to go to overtime for around +1000. As a quick aside, do not bet the game to go to overtime. 
The 49ers coach was part of the only other OT game in Super Bowl history when he was the Falcons’ offensive coordinator seven years ago. That was the 28-3 blown lead to the Patriots. The Patriots went on to win 34-28 after their opening drive of overtime won the game, under the NFL's overtime rules at the time. 
Sometimes 60 minutes simply isn't enough in the Super Bowl. Well, only twice. The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers needed overtime on Sunday to determine the champion of Super Bowl LVIII. It was only the second time in the Super Bowl's 58-year history that the game went to overtime. 
The Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers entered overtime during the 2024 Super Bowl in Las Vegas, leading many to wonder how many times the NFL's biggest game went past four quarters  
In the first 56 Super Bowls, though, only one went into overtime, when the New England Patriots rallied from behind to win 34-28 over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. 
The First Overtime Game in Super Bowl History. The first Super Bowl to go into overtime was Super Bowl XXX, played on January 28, 1996, between the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The game was tied at 13-13, and the Steelers won the coin toss to receive the ball. 
The Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers entered overtime during the 2024 Super Bowl in Las Vegas, leading many to wonder how many times the NFL's biggest game went past four quarters  
And after NFL Regular Season Week 6, there had already been 11 games that went to OT and after the first-ever 17-game slate, an incredible 21 OT games had been played with the Raiders playing four (4-0) and the Ravens three (2-1)—and vs. each other in Week 1.
