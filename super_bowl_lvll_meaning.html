        <p>Here, Super Bowls are always referred to in numerical digits, so Super Bowl 58 is used. Why does the NFL use Roman numerals for the Super Bowl? The confusing number choice for the Super Bowl dates  
Super Bowl V was the first such game to use Roman numerals — a system the NFL put into place to avoid confusion, as a Super Bowl is played in a calendar year following a listed season. 
Why does the Super Bowl use Roman numerals? Here is the explanation from the NFL's media guide: "The Roman numerals were adopted to clarify any confusion that may occur because the NFL  
The Chiefs and 49ers will face off for the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday in Super Bowl LVIII, or in other terms Super Bowl 58. The game is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET inside Allegiant  
In the Super Bowl era, there’s one exception to the Roman numeral rule: Super Bowl 50 decided the champion of the 2015 season, with the Denver Broncos defeating the Carolina Panthers 24-10. “50" in Roman numerals is denoted simply as “L”, not exactly a positive symbol in modern culture (think of the lyrics to Smash Mouth’s 1999  
These are what the symbols mean, according to the National Archives: I = 1. V = 5. X = 10. L = 50. C = 100. D = 500. M = 1,000. The basic rules are that if a smaller number (meaning a symbol that represents a smaller number) comes before a larger number, you subtract it. So IV would be I, meaning 1, before V, meaning 5. You subtract 1 from 5  
With these basic rules, deciphering the Roman numeral for any Super Bowl is straightforward. This year's LVIII simply translates to 58: L = 50, V = 5, and III = 3. Decoding the Roman numerals for this year's Super Bowl is pretty easy. This year's LVIII simply translates to 58: L = 50, V = 5, and III = 3 (Getty Images) The curious case of Super  
It kind of looks like Super Bowl Level or something, but Super Bowl LVIII means this is Super Bowl 58 in 2024. In Roman numerals, L means 50, V means 5, and each I counts as 1. So 50 plus 5 plus 3  
The letters LVIII are Roman numerals that mean “58,” so fans will hear commentators refer to “Super Bowl 58,” but the numbers won’t appear on any official National Football League or CBS  
Super Bowl LV in Tampa, Florida, isn't too bad to figure out this year, anyway, with the "L" symbol representing "50" and "V" meaning "5." Skip Navigation Share on Facebook

Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season.The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35. 
What does Super Bowl LVII mean in Roman numerals? While the two look nothing alike, it’s true: the Roman numerals LVII equal 57. In the ancient letters-are-numbers system, L represents 50, V  
Since 2021, Roman numerals have been filled with city-inspired colors and designs: Los Angeles’s Super Bowl LVI logo featured orange numerals with palm trees; Arizona’s Super Bowl LVII logo included purple and red canyons beneath a blue-green sky; and the Super Bowl LVIII logo was purple and pink featuring the Las Vegas Strip.
