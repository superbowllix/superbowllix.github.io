        <p>But in this scenario, "He" is the center of a marketing campaign that has spread far across the U.S., spanning between billboards, banner ads online, and a forthcoming Super Bowl commercial. 
A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7 million for Super Bowl 58, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines. 
A group called He Gets Us ran two ads during the Super Bowl game on Sunday to spread the word about Jesus. One of the donors behind the ads is a craft chain billionaire worth nearly $15 billion. 
The “He Gets Us” ad campaign for Jesus, created by a Dallas advertising firm, will air a Super Bowl ad for the third consecutive year this weekend.Dallas-based  
The campaign, consisting of billboards, online ads, and television commercials, was rolled out in March 2022 by the Servant Foundation.

Jesus Christ showed up at Super Bowl LVIII – and somehow, nobody was happy about it. Here's how and why it happened, and the surprising reasons why viewers f 
The two Super Bowl ads created by the campaign will focus on “the behavior Jesus modeled in relationship and conflict,” He Gets Us spokesman Jason Vanderground told CNA. 
The 2024 Super Bowl featured a "He Gets Us" commercial. Viewers who caught it may be wondering about the song played during and who the voice behind it was. 
Naturally, the price of running a commercial during the game is enormous. A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7 million for Super Bowl 58, on top of the money it takes to create what are  
As per Newsweek, the 75 second Jesus ad (60 + 15) cost approximately $20 million. The Super Bowl has long been the standout event in the American sports calendar ever since it was created in 1966

He Gets Us Super Bowl Ad 2024 – A moment of humility in a time of glory: The ‘Foot Washing’ ad by He Gets Us. The “Foot Washing” advert’s placement in the Super Bowl lineup could amplify its message to a vast audience, offering a moment of introspection amid the event’s festivities. 
He Gets Us, a $100 million campaign reimagining Jesus’ message, is airing a 60-second “True Greatness” spot at Super Bowl 2025. Learn how the nonprofit Come Near, Jon Batiste’s Love Riot Festival, and AI-driven art are shaping this year’s faith-based outreach. </p>
