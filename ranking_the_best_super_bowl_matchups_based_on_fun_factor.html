        <p>It’d feature one of the league’s best offenses — the Lions, who rank fifth with 26.9 points per game — and one of the best defenses, as the Chiefs are No. 2 in points surrendered per contest . 
The Super Bowl is always the biggest game of the year, and one of the largest spectacles in all of sports — but that doesn’t always mean the game is fun. Look no further than last year. Sure  
Super Bowl 2024: The 5 best potential matchups ranked by fun factor A look at the best Super Bowl LVIII matchups still in play. By Jason Marcum @marcum89 Jan 20, 2024, 10:00am EST 
What are the greatest Super Bowl matchups of all time? Since the first Super Bowl in 1967, teams from the AFC (formerly AFL) and NFC (formerly NFL) have battled it out to see who could take the Vince Lombardi trophy back to their respective cities. The Super Bowl will usually pit the best two 
With that being said, here is my official rankings for which Super Bowl matchup would be the most fun to watch  1. PURE ECSTACY: Commanders vs. Bills. We deserve this Super Bowl. Two electric offenses, two shaky defenses, and most importantly—no Chiefs. 
You’ll watch anyway. But behold the definitive ranking of the four possible Super Bowl matchups, listed in order of how much fun they’d be for a person who doesn’t care for any of the involved teams. 1. Eagles vs. Bills. In pure efficiency terms, these are the two best teams left. 
The Eagles vs. Doug Pederson or Andy Reid. Stefon Diggs vs. his brother. A Chiefs-49ers rematch or Cowboys vs. Bills for a third time. All are great options. 
With San Francisco, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Cincinnati all playing in the NFL, conference championship games, Sporting News ranks the four Super Bowl 57 matchups based on the most compelling  
Peyton Manning’s final Super Bowl appearance as a member of the Colts started off strong. Indianapolis jumped to a 10-0 lead, and were still ahead when the fourth quarter began. However, Super Bowl XLIV would be defined by a pair of big plays from the Saints. The first came during the second half kickoff when the Saints recovered an onside kick. 
Super Bowl 54 is fresh enough for a legitimate revenge factor to course throughout the affair, as plenty of the primary figures in that clash are still around for both Kansas City and San Francisco. 
As conference championship week gets underway, the number of potential Super Bowl matchups left on the board has dwindled to just four. The Bills, Chiefs, Commanders, and Eagles have proven  
THIS was the best Super Bowl matchup of all time. • • • • • And there you have it — the Top 15 best uni matchups ever in Super Bowl history. As I mentioned at the outset, feel free to disagree in the comments below. 
While the country will gather together regardless of the teams involved, there are select matchups that would increase the night's overall viewership. Here are the top five Super Bowl matchups, based on the ratings they'd draw. (Self-decided rule: a team can make the ranking only twice.) 5. Bills vs. Seahawks 
But first, it deserves to be said that all four potential matchups would seemingly offer a fun Super Bowl 51. These are four of the best and most explosive offenses in the league, so fireworks  
Explore our ranking of the most likely matchups for Super Bowl LIX, as we break down each team's path to the big game. SportsGrid has more right here. 
This matchup would be a fun glimpse of the present (three-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes) vs. the future (likely 2024 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels) at the NFL's quarterback  
Let's power rank the most likely Super Bowl matchups ahead of Week 9. NFL Power Rankings: Ranking most likely Super Bowl matchups ahead of Week 9 5. Green Bay Packers vs. Houston Texans. This would be a fun and new Super Bowl. I've predicted that the Houston Texans would represent the AFC in the Super Bowl this year. 
Here's our ranking of all 49 matchups, from worst to best, ranked using a proprietary and highly scientific formula that combines team quality, history, watchability, popularity and general gut  
Big Ben vs. Eli would give us two great Super Bowl QBs. USATSI 7. Steelers vs. Giants: Loser of this one has to buy all the food for the next Rooney-Mara Thanksgiving. 
We are less than three weeks away from Super Bowl LVIII and there are just four teams left vying for the Lombardi Trophy. The Detroit Lions, Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco  </p>
