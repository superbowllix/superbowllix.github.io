Tiffany Takes 4 Months to Make the Super Bowl’s Vince Lombardi Trophy. Here’s How It’s Done. The iconic jeweler has been hand-crafting football's big prize for 55 years. 
A Lancaster County jeweler once was one of the craftsmen responsible for creating the Lombardi Trophy, awarded to the winner of the NFL's Super Bowl each year. Stephanie Perrotti, of Mount Joy, is  
The trophy received its official name ahead of Super Bowl V in 1971. It was named for legendary coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victory in the first two Super Bowls. 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. [1] 
The original trophy was produced by Tiffany &amp; Co. in New Jersey, but as of 2017, it has been made in Cumberland, Rhode Island. They say that winning the Super Bowl Trophy is priceless. Well, that’s not entirely accurate. The trophy costs $50,000 to produce and takes four months and 72 hours of labor to complete. Do Players Get Their Own Super  
The Lombardi Trophy is made by Tiffany &amp; Co., a luxury jewelry company based in New York City. They've created the trophy from the very first Super Bowl. 
The Vince Lombardi Super Bowl Trophy marks the pinnacle of gridiron glory. Tiffany has produced the coveted 22-inch, 8.75-pound trophy since the first Super Bowl in 1967. In 1970, the trophy was renamed for Vince Lombardi, the late Green Bay Packers coach who led the Packers to victory in the first two Super Bowls. 
Though American football has been played since 1869, the first Super Bowl trophy was awarded nearly 100 hundred years later in 1967 when the Green Bay Packers, led by head coach Vince Lombardi, routed the Kansas City in Super Bowl I. Lombardi also won 2nd Super Bowl the following year as well against the Oakland Raiders.

Each year, the NFL's 32 teams compete for football's greatest prize: the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Awarded to the Super Bowl champions, the Tiffany &amp; Co. creation is a sterling silver masterpiece. 
Of course, the specific story on each year’s ring is always different. For example, the bezel of the Philadelphia Eagles ring for its Super Bowl LII victory depicts a single trick play known as the Philly Special through a “waterfall” of 127 diamonds, a number representing the total of the jersey numbers of the three players who executed it—running back Corey Clement (30), tight end  </p>
