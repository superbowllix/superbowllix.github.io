The Lions won four NFL Championship Games between 1935 and 1957. Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
In the Super Bowl era, the Lions have made three appearances in the NFC Championship Game: the 1991 season (lost to Washington) and the 2023 season (lost to San Fransisco).

The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, the Detroit Lions have won the NFL Championship 4 times, most recently in the 1957 season. 
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. The Lions also lost the 1954 NFL Championship in their quest for a three-peat.

With the right coaching, a healthy roster, and a quarterback playing at a high level, the Lions are primed to make their Super Bowl dream a reality. It’s not just hope—it’s a well-earned belief that the Detroit Lions will WIN Super Bowl LX and end a decades-long championship drought. Get ready, Detroit—it’s time to celebrate! 
The Super Bowl Drought. Since then, the Lions have had no championship or title. This is one of the longest droughts across all four major American sports. 66 years in the making, the Detroit Lions are poised to hang a banner up at Ford Field this season and capture their first-ever Super Bowl title. 
The Super Bowl XL rings were produced by the Minneapolis-based jewelry company Jostens, which is the primary supplier of Super Bowl champion rings and has made 31 rings in the Super Bowl's 50-year history through 2017. [84] 
By Justin Stulpe. The Detroit Lions are poised to make history this season, and it is time to believe the hype.
