        <h2><strong>quarterbacks with super bowl rings from different teams jay z super bowl dr dre</strong></h2>
        <p>Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are the only starting quarterbacks to have won Super Bowls for two NFL teams, while Craig Morton and Kurt Warner are the only other quarterbacks to have started for a second team. Jim McMahon won a second Super Bowl ring having been a backup on the Brett Favre-led Green Bay Packers team that won Super Bowl XXXI. 
On the heels of the Chiefs second Super Bowl win in a row, one more name was added to the list in 2023. That player? Backup quarterback Blaine Gabbert. After a long career as a backup, Gabbert got his ring in 2021 when the Tom Brady-led Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV. 
Winning one Super Bowl is a goal for NFL players. There are plenty who have captured multiple rings. But which players have been on different teams that won Super Bowls? (Note: Asterisk means the play wasn’t active for the game.) 
Manning made history in Feb. 2016 as the first NFL QB to win the Super Bowl with two different teams. Tom Brady: The legendary seven-time Super Bowl winner completes this list. Brady won six of his rings with the New England Patriots throughout the 2000s and 2010s. However, he didn’t take long to win with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He won in  
Ben Roethlisberger won two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 and 2009, becoming one of the youngest quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl in his first victory. “Big Ben” was known  
It is no secret that being the ultimate team game or not, the quarterback will generally unduly endure the brunt of the blame for a Super Bowl loss but oftentimes bask in the glory of winning the Super Bowl ring. Here is a complete list of the starting QBs that took center stage after their team won in the first 58 editions of the Super Bowl. 
Players with most rings on multiple teams (NFL regular season in parentheses) QB Tom Brady: 7 (New England Patriots: 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, 2018; Tampa Bay Buccaneers: 2020) DE Charles  
Peyton Manning (2-2) Peyton Manning is the only starting quarterback to win Super Bowls with two different teams. He took the Indianapolis Colts to two Super Bowls and won his first in 2007 before taking his talents to Denver. Manning led the Broncos to the Super Bowl in 2014 and rode off into the sunset after winning Super Bowl 50 two years later.

He will always be the 1st quarterback to win a Super Bowl with 2 different franchises, a fitting record for the only quarterback to go to 4 Super Bowls with 4 different head coaches too. Manning’s playoff legacy is often criticized for his 14-13 record and 9 one-and-done postseasons, but when his team got past the opening game, he was 14-4  
Nick Foles etched his name in NFL history with his unfathomable run to Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl victory. Following an injury to MVP candidate Carson Wentz, Foles rose to prominence with the Philadelphia Eagles and guided them to victory in Super Bowl LII — earning Super Bowl MVP in the process after throwing for 373 yards and three touchdowns. 
Super Bowl Winning Quarterbacks There is an extremely rich history when it comes to Super Bowl winning quarterbacks. The history of Super Bowl quarterbacks dates back to 1967 at Super Bowl I when Bart Starr led the Green Bay Packers to a championship. From there on, the list of super bowl winning Q 
Quarterback Tom Brady has won the most NFL championships, with seven. Tom Brady (quarterback) won Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LIII with the New England Patriots after the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2018 seasons, respectively. [1] He won Super Bowl LV with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the 2020 season. [2] 
Patrick Mahomes is heading to his third Super Bowl at just 27 years old, but Tom Brady reigns supreme with 10 Super Bowl appearances and seven wins. 
The first Super Bowl rings were awarded in 1966 to the Green Bay Packers. They featured a 0.5-carat diamond surrounded by white gold. The rings were designed by Packers head coach Vince Lombardi

Editor’s note: This post has been updated with new information. With the 2025 Super Bowl on the way, we’ll soon know if a new NFL quarterback will join the eternal list of Super Bowl champions. 
Super Bowl rings are what it’s all about, and while simply winning one doesn’t make you an all-timer, it permanently etches your name in NFL lore. That’s why certain franchises and individual players who have either racked up multiple rings or taken part in some of the most memorable moments in Super Bowl history have their legacies secured.
