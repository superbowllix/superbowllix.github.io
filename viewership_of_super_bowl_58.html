San Francisco 49ers fans celebrate a touchdown as they watch the Super Bowl 58 NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs from a pool on top of the Circa Resort and Casino, Sunday, Feb. 11  
The Super Bowl 58 featuring the Kansas City Chiefs versus the San Francisco 49ers has shattered all previous TV ratings records, with a historic estimated 123.7 million viewers.

CBS Sports' presentation of the Kansas City Chiefs' overtime victory in Super Bowl 58 was the most-watched telecast in history, with more than 120 million viewers across all CBS platforms. 
Specifically, the 112 million official viewership of Super Bowl 51 – which is believed to stretch to as much as 124 million – would surpass 58’s total. CBS last broadcast the Super Bowl in 2021, when it aired Super Bowl 55, which at 91.6 million English-language viewers was the lowest-watched Super Bowl since 2006. 
Super Bowl 58 was the most-watched program ever, up 7% in viewership from Super Bowl 57, which held the previous record with 115.1 million average viewers. More than 200 million viewers watched at

That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M).
