        <p>PLAYOFF PICKS: NFL Week 19 Picks: Spread, Moneyline, Over/Under - USA TODAY Here are the Super Bowl picks from six Detroit Free Press writers, with each predicting the Lions to make it to New Orleans. 
The Detroit Lions have already become media darlings for the 2024 season, with several picking them as Super Bowl bound. By Jeremy Reisman @DetroitOnLion Feb 19, 2024, 2:30pm EST / new 
The Lions are the top seed in the NFC and the favorite to win the Super Bowl, according to top online sportsbooks. The Chiefs, the AFC's No. 1 seed, are close behind, while the Ravens, Bills, Eagles and Packers are also contenders. 
Detroit Lions must win 3 games in NFL playoffs 2025 to win the franchise's first-ever Super Bowl. Here are our game picks through the entire bracket. 
An early Super Bowl prediction. I had the Lions winning the NFC and facing the Kansas City Chiefs in my preseason Super Bowl prediction, and I don’t see much reason to change that now. The Lions are the best team in the NFC and they have the best non-weather-related homefield advantage in all of football. 
The Lions are the betting favorite to win the Super Bowl for the first time in their history, according to Caesars Sportsbook. They have a 10-1 record, a dominant offense, and a chance to win on Thanksgiving for the first time since 2016. 
The Detroit Lions are once again the favorites to win Super Bowl 59. After a dominant, exclamation point win over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18, the Lions are the favorite to win the Super Bowl at +280, according to BetMGM, meaning a $10 bet would net you $28 profit, plus your $10 back. 
The Lions now have 31-to-10 odds, or +310, to win Super Bowl 59, and are listed at +120 to win the NFC. That means a $10 bet on the Lions to win the Super Bowl would pay you $31 if they win, plus  
The Lions are the current odds-on favorite to win Super Bowl LIX, according to DraftKings, after a franchise-record 15-win season in 2024. Coach Dan Campbell is also a leading candidate for Coach of the Year, despite facing many injuries and challenges. 
Currently the Detroit Lions have the best odds in the NFL to win the Super Bowl, listed at +275. In their last outing on Jan. 5, the Lions took home a 31-9 win against the Minnesota Vikings. Jared  
Lions' Super Bowl Push. The Detroit Lions are currently second in Super Bowl odds at +400, just behind the Kansas City Chiefs, who sit at +370. The Lions’ powerful offense, led by quarterback Jared Goff and standout players like Amon-Ra St. Brown, combined with a solid defense, has them in prime position to make a deep playoff run. 
The updated Super Bowl 2025 odds for NFL Week 8 see the Lions (+800) and Commanders (+3500) on the rise while the 49ers (+850) and Jets (+5000) fall. 
The Lions' Super Bowl odds sit at +450, indicating that they are considered one of the top contenders in the league. While there are still questions about how they will perform in the high-pressure moments of the postseason, their solid all-around play and ability to compete against tough opponents suggest they could make a deep run. 
At +280, the Detroit Lions currently have the best Super Bowl odds in the NFL. The Lions took down the Minnesota Vikings 31-9 in their last outing. Jared Goff led the Lions with 231 yards on 27-of-33 passing (81.8%) for one touchdown and two interceptions. 
Super Bowl 60 Odds. Top 10 odds to win Super Bowl 60. Ravens +500; Chiefs +550; Bills +750; Lions +850; Eagles +900; Commanders +1500; 49ers +1800; Bengals +2000; Chargers +2200; Packers +2200  
Best Lions NFL futures bets. While the Lions have the best Super Bowl odds across our best sports betting apps, that isn't the only way to bet on this group in the NFL futures market.. Detroit is  
After Week 10 of the NFL season, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith made his Super Bowl prediction.  "If I had to pick, it would be the Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions in the Super Bowl, and I  
Here are the Super Bowl picks from six Detroit Free Press writers, with each predicting the Lions to make it to New Orleans. Dave Birkett I picked the Lions to play the Chiefs in the Super Bowl leading into the season in September , and there's no reason to change my prediction — except for the winner of the game. 
Lions fans searching for solace won't find it in the sports gambling world. The big picture: Detroit lost its status as Super Bowl favorites after Sunday's soul-crushing loss to the Bills. With so many key injuries, this defense is no longer seen by experts as championship-caliber. 
The Detroit Lions have officially shifted the narrative in the 2024 season. After a dominating 52-6 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Lions have become the new favorites to win the Super Bowl, according to updated odds. </p>
