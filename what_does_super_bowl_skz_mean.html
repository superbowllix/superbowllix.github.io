I Got It-I mean some pretended he he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get the top bish/dish- watch any concert performance, ge clearly enunciates bitch. I don‚Äôt know enough to explain the title in Korean but it‚Äôs vulgar too- he‚Äôs a rapper, it was a diss (it was a skz player tho) 
Ultimately, 'God's Menu 2' claimed the title track spot, rebranding as 'God's Menu' and rising to become Stray Kids' most acclaimed song. I.N., while initially favoring 'Super Bowl' as the title

They compare themselves to a Michelin-starred chef cooking up a storm at the Super Bowl, with their finger-licking good music leaving the listeners craving for more. 
Super Bowl Lyrics: Cookin' up a storm, piece of cake (Cake, cake, cake) / Spittin' out that fire, feel the blaze (Feel the blaze) / Takin' over, we don't play by the rules / If you wanna feel alive 
Super Bowl is a song recorded by South Korean boy group Stray Kids. It is the fourth track from their third studio album ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5-STAR). The song is literally a "big bowl", with a large scale of confidence like the American football championship game Super Bowl.

A pesar de los desaf√≠os ('If there‚Äôs a drought, never doubt'), Stray Kids promete continuar trabajando duro y 'traer la lluvia', lo que significa superar obst√°culos y mantener su √©xito. En resumen, 'Super Bowl' es una celebraci√≥n de su arte, un compromiso con la excelencia y una promesa de mantenerse en la cima de su juego.

They‚Äôve been performing Megaverse and Hall of Fame a lot recently in fan meets and things so I would expect those. I would also put money on Topline , Maniac , Super Bowl, and atleast one of Hellevator/ District 9/ Victory Song. Things that could be included : Thunderous, Superboard, Item, Back Door, Side Effects.
