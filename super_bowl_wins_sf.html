        <p>Super Bowl 16: 49ers 26, Bengals 21; San Francisco's first Super Bowl appearance was a success. Led by eventual Super Bowl MVP Joe Montana, the 49ers build a 20-0 lead in the first half against  
The San Francisco 49ers will try to win a sixth Super Bowl in franchise history on Sunday in Las Vegas. If the 49ers can defeat the Chiefs, San Francisco will become just the third NFL franchise  
The 49ers will be looking for revenge in this Super Bowl rematch, with the Chiefs having beaten San Francisco in Super Bowl LIV in the 2019 season. How many Super Bowls have the 49ers played in? This year marks the 49ers eighth Super Bowl appearance, which is tied for the 2nd-most by any team in NFL history. 
How many times have the San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl? The San Francisco 49ers have won a total of 5 Super Bowls, in 1981, 1984, 1988-1989 and 1994. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in San Francisco. 
The hall of fame quarterback would lead San Francisco to Super Bowl glory in 1982 and 1985 before back-to-back successes in 1989 and 1990. Following his retirement, the 49ers returned to the Super Bowl in 1995 with Steve Young under centre, and San Francisco beat the San Diego Chargers in a 10-touchdown thriller to become the first team to win  
49ers’ Super Bowl Wins. This year marks the 49ers’ eighth Super Bowl appearance, which is tied for the 2nd-most by any team in NFL history. San Francisco will join the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Cowboys, and Denver Broncos with eight Super Bowl appearances, while only the Patriots have played in more (11). 
The San Francisco 49ers have won five Super Bowls in seven appearances. Their first Super Bowl win was in 1982 (Super Bowl XVI). The team won all of their Super Bowl matches in the 1980s and 1990s  
Super Bowl XXIX. San Francisco became the first team to win five Super Bowls with another blowout victory — this one over the surprising San Diego Chargers, 49-26. The 49ers had a comfortable 28-10 lead at the half and led by as many as 32 points in the second half. 
The San Francisco 49ers are back in the Super Bowl for the third time since the 2012 season, but they’re seeking their first championship since 1994.  This is their eighth appearance in the  
Super Bowl, 1982. Who did the 49ers play: Cincinnati Bengals. Did the 49ers win: Yes. The San Francisco 49ers made their first Super Bowl appearance in 1982, defeating the Cincinnati Bengals 26-21  
Mahomes' first Super Bowl win came in 2020 — just three years after being drafted to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2017. At just 24-years-old, he led the team to victory over the San Francisco 49ers
