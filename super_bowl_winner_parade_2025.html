        <h2><strong>super bowl winner parade 2025 super bowl quiz for kids</strong></h2>
        <p>The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles go head-to-head in New Orleans this Sunday, February 9th. The winning team from the NFL’s annual Super Bowl game is usually celebrated at Walt Disney World with the Most Valuable Player (MVP) being part of the iconic “I’m going to Disney World!” commercial, before starring in a parade down Main Street U.S.A.

Based on what happened the last time the Eagles won the Lombardi Trophy, the parade would likely take place midweek. In 2018, the Eagles’ Super Bowl parade happened the Thursday following the game.

The last few years of the Super Bowl parade have been at Disneyland in California.
