        <h2><strong>super bowl wins by lions super bowl radio broadcast online</strong></h2>
        <p>The Lions are one of 12 NFL teams that do not have any Super Bowl wins in franchise history. Yet while Detroit does not have a Super Bowl to its name, the franchise has won an NFL championship. 
When was the last time the Lions lost a playoff game? In 2024, the Detroit Lions lost to the Washington Commanders in the Divisional Round. What years did the Lions make the Super Bowl? The Detroit Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl. 
The Lions won four NFL Championship Games between 1935 and 1957. Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships  
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, the Detroit Lions have won the NFL Championship 4 times, most recently in the 1957 season. 
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. 
The Detroit Lions have not yet won a Super Bowl, as of December 2024. Get detailed information on Detroit Lions Super Bowl Appearances, their championships wins and much more on Sportskeeda. 
The Detroit Lions are now one win from reaching the Super Bowl, which would be their first-ever appearance in the Big Game, after knocking out Tampa Bay, 31-23.. Yes, the Lions are the only NFC  
Detroit Lions Playoff History. Team Names: Portsmouth Spartans, Detroit Lions. Seasons: 95 (1930 to 2024) Record (W-L-T): 606-709-34 Playoff Record: 9-15. Super Bowls Won: 0 (0 Appearances) Championships Won *: 4 All-time Passing Leader: Matthew Stafford 3,898/6,224, 45,109 yds, 282 TD All-time Rushing Leader: Barry Sanders 3,062 att, 15,269  
The Lions are one of just four teams in the NFL that have never suited up on Super Bowl Sunday, a list that features two franchises that were brought into the league since the mid-1990s in the  
Detroit Lions must win 3 games in NFL playoffs 2025 to win the franchise's first-ever Super Bowl. Here are our game picks through the entire bracket. 
The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL. The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) – winning the last two. 
Detroit Lions Super Bowl appearances. The Lions have never appeared in the Super Bowl. They are the only team that has existed during the entire Super Bowl era that has not played in at least one such game. How many Super Bowls have the Detroit Lions won? As mentioned previously, the Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl and thus have never  
This shows the Lions are still searching for their first Super Bowl win. The Super Bowl Era: A New Challenge. Since the Super Bowl era started, the Lions have had trouble winning in the playoffs. They’ve had great seasons but never made it to the Super Bowl. The team’s success has changed since the 1950s. Now, they want to win a Super Bowl. 
The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX. 
An early Super Bowl prediction. I had the Lions winning the NFC and facing the Kansas City Chiefs in my preseason Super Bowl prediction, and I don’t see much reason to change that now. The Lions are the best team in the NFC and they have the best non-weather-related homefield advantage in all of football. 
Detroit Lions fans had a vested interest in Super Bowl 56.. Not only did former Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford lead the Rams to a 23-20 win with a patented come-from-behind victory, but the  
The Detroit Lions are once again the favorites to win Super Bowl 59. After a dominant, exclamation point win over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18, the Lions are the favorite to win the Super Bowl at +280, according to BetMGM, meaning a $10 bet would net you $28 profit, plus your $10 back. 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year.
