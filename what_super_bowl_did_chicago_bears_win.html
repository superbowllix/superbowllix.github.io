        <p>What years did the Chicago Bears win the Super Bowl? The Bears have won the Super Bowl only on one occasion. It was against the New England Patriots after they came off a 15-1 regular season  
The Chicago Bears have won the Super Bowl a single time, in the 1985 season. Additionally, the Chicago Bears have won the NFL Championship 6 times, most recently in the 1963 season. 
III: The Bears taped "The Super Bowl Shuffle" at the Park West in Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 3, hours after landing in Chicago following their only loss of the season, a 38-24 defeat on Monday Night Football in Miami. Walter Payton and Jim McMahon taped their portions later via a green screen in a racquetball court at Halas Hall. 
The Bears only have one Super Bowl victory, but their 1985 team that won it all is widely regarded as one of the best squads in NFL history. Led by legendary head coach Mike Ditka, Chicago lost just one game en route to Super Bowl XX. 
Super Bowl XX was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1985 season. 
The Bears won Super Bowl XX, the first one they appeared in. That season was famous for the release of the "Super Bowl Shuffle," a quintessentially '80s rap song that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 immediately following Chicago's championship and is still talked about today. 
Eight franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls: Green Bay Packers (1966-67 seasons), Miami Dolphins  Super Bowl XX: Chicago Bears 46, New England Patriots 10. MVP: Richard Dent | Location  
Chicago Bears Playoff History. Team Names: Decatur Staleys, Chicago Staleys, Chicago Bears Seasons: 105 (1920 to 2024) Record (W-L-T): 798-646-42 Playoff Record: 17-20 Super Bowls Won: 1 (2 Appearances) 
The Bears won eight NFL Championships in the pre-Super Bowl era. Going back before they won the Lombardi in 1985, the Bears dominated the league for a few decades, but no run was more impressive  
On January 26, 1986, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Chicago Bears score a Super Bowl record number of points to defeat the New England Patriots, 46-10, and win their first championship since 1963. 
Hester's touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did this went on to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in  
In 2020, the Chicago Bears lost to the New Orleans Saints in the Wild Card Round. What years did the Bears make the Super Bowl? The Chicago Bears have appeared in the Super Bowl 2 times, in 1985 and 2006. 
Carpenters put up an orange letter “B” to read Bears over the “S” on the Sears Tower after the Chicago Bears won the Super Bowl, Jan. 27, 1986, in Chicago. 
The Bears dominating Super Bowl win was brutally magnificent. More Super Bowl wins for this great team seemed sure. The Bears had one of the youngest teams in the league

"The Super Bowl Shuffle" is a song performed by the Chicago Bears football team (credited as the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew) in 1985. It was released in December 1985 on Chicago-based Red Label Records and distributed through Capitol Records [2] seven weeks ahead of their win in Super Bowl XX. 
Decades have since passed, and not only have the Bears not won another Super Bowl, but they’ve also struggled to achieve any form of sustained success. That can, and should, change in 2025. 
On Jan. 26, 1986, the Bears defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, capping one of the greatest seasons in NFL history. On the 35th anniversary, we look at some of the players on that team then and find out what they've been up to since becoming world cha 
During her tenure, the team won its first Super Bowl at the end of the 1985 season. She was born Virginia Marion Halas in Chicago in 1923. She was the eldest child of George and Minnie Bushing Halas. 
No, the Chicago Bears were the mightiest, proudest, most ferocious team in NFL history. Chicago won its first 12 games in a row, and most of them by convincing margins: 45-10 over the Redskins, 26-10 over the 49ers, 44-0 over the Cowboys, even 20-7 over the Patriots early in the season. </p>
