        <p>The team was also wearing red for Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid's first Super Bowl victory together in Super Bowl 54, also against the 49ers, to cap the 2019-2020 season. 
Well, uniforms aren't likely to determine on-field results, but if you're of a superstitious ilk, the teams wearing white away jerseys are a whopping 16-4 in the last 20 Super Bowls. 
Kansas City is 1-1 in the Super Bowl in white jerseys, including a loss to the Green Bay Packers in the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game, retroactively known as Super Bowl I, though the team  
At Super Bowl LIX, the Eagles are designated as the home team against the Chiefs so they got to chose which jerseys to wear. The AFC and NFC alternate as the home team each year, with the NFC the  
Super Bowl 59 uniforms. Each year, the Super Bowl is played at a neutral site. The "home" team alternates yearly between the AFC and NFC champions. 
Here's how each Super Bowl involving the Chiefs and Eagles has gone over the last 20 years: Super Bowl XXXVIII: Patriots defeat Eagles, 24-21 (team wearing away uniforms won); Super Bowl LII  
The Chiefs have worn red in four of their six Super Bowl appearances. They're an even 2-2 in red and 1-1 in white. In 2021, Kansas City became the first team to wear a colored uniform in consecutive Super Bowls since the Buffalo Bills in 1993 and 1994. Opposite the Cowboys, Buffalo probably didn't get a choice, either. 
A 9-7 Rams team upset the Cowboys in the divisional round then deprived the world of what may have been the strangest (for its era) Super Bowl uniform by beating the Buccaneers 9-0 in the NFC  
The 49ers defeated the Broncos, 55-10, in Super Bowl 24 while donning white uniforms, a monumental win to earn back-to-back championships, but the 'Niners lost to the Chiefs in Super Bowl 54 in white. 
The Chiefs and Eagles are set for a Super Bowl 57 matchup on Feb. 12, and the two teams with some of the most recognizable looks in the NFL are gearing up for a sexy jersey showdown, too. 
In the last 10 years, the only teams to win a championship wearing a different color were the teams competing in this year's Super Bowl: the Eagles (in Super Bowl 52) and the Chiefs (in Super  
The Super Bowl LIX uniform matchup is set. The Kansas City Chiefs will wear their away white uniforms on Feb. 9 when they take on the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles, who will wear their home greens. 
The Chiefs were the home team for Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas last season and decided to create a uniform rematch of Super Bowl LIV. Kansas City wore its red home jerseys, while the San

Super Bowl LVIII is a rematch of teams and uniforms as the Chiefs and 49ers will be wearing the same threads as the ones in Super Bowl LIV.  the same uniform matchup as the Super Bowl in 2020  
The NFL mandated home team in the Super Bowl had to wear a colored uniform; erego, Dallas, whose home jersey was actually white, wore their blue jerseys in one of the sloppiest Super Bowls in history. No wonder Bob Lilly threw his helmet 40 yards after the loss. 
The Chiefs were the home team for Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas last season and decided to create a uniform rematch of Super Bowl LIV. Kansas City wore its red home jerseys, while the San  
The Cincinnati Bengals will be wearing black jerseys with white pants and orange socks at Super Bowl LVI. As the designated home team for Super Bowl LVI, the Bengals got the first choice of what  </p>
