The Super Bowl was first played in February in 2004, held on the first day of the month, for the XXXVIII edition of the game, between the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers. It was held on the first Sunday of the month until 2021, when it subsequently moved to 2022 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic with Super Bowl LVI. 
This year marks the eighth time that the Super Bowl has been played at the Superdome. Kickoff will be on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, at 5:30 p.m. CT local time (6:30 p.m. ET, 3:30 p.m. PT).

In the Super Bowl, if the score is tied after regulation, teams will play in overtime periods until there is a winner. This would extend playing time and make the Super Bowl longer than expected. This has only happened twice, with the first being in Super Bowl LI in a game that pitted the New England Patriots against the Atlanta Falcons. Tom  
Initially, in 2018, the Superdome was chosen as the host stadium for last year's Super Bowl. After the NFL expanded its regular season to 17 games in 2020, the original date of the Big Game in
