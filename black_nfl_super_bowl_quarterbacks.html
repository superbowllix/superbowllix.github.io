        <h2><strong>black nfl super bowl quarterbacks super bowl parade event</strong></h2>
        <p>Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320  
The first Black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl, he was named the game's MVP and went on to a long career as an NFL coach and executive. Steve McNair 
Selected third overall in the 1995 NFL Draft, Steve McNair was the highest-drafted Black quarterback at the time. He was a true dual-threat, leading the Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV against Kurt  
Washington won 42-10, and Williams was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to start in and win any NFL championship game, including those before the Super Bowl was established. 
Marlin Briscoe became the first Black player to start at quarterback during the Super Bowl era, doing it in 1968 for the Broncos in the American Football League, two years before the 1970 NFL-AFL  
The following year, he became the first black quarterback to repeat as Super Bowl champion. Super Bowl LVII also marked the first time that both Super Bowl starting quarterbacks were black: Patrick Mahomes started for the Kansas City Chiefs, while Jalen Hurts started for the Philadelphia Eagles. 
But racist assumptions kept Black players from the starting quarterback position for nearly another two decades. Doug Williams became the first quarterback to start in – and win – a Super Bowl in 1988. It was not until 2017 that all 32 NFL teams had started at least one Black quarterback. 
Patrick Mahomes is the third and most recent Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl and earn the Super Bowl MVP title. Following the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs to a 31-20 Super Bowl 54 win against the San Francisco 49ers, completing 26 of 42 passes for 286 yards with two touchdown passes. 
Over 100 quarterbacks have appeared at the Super Bowl, of which only eight were Black. Of the eight who have led their teams, only three have won. In 2023, Mahomes made history by becoming the 
What started with Marlin Briscoe — the first Black starting quarterback in NFL history — and Doug Williams — the first Black quarterback to start in a Super Bowl MVP — has evolved to a moment 
In the National Football League’s (NFL) history, three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. In 1988, Doug Williams, who played for Washington, made history as the first Black QB to win the NFL’s biggest game. Decades later, Russell Wilson would lead the Seattle Seahawks to victory in 2014 and, most recently, Patrick Mahomes of Kansas City won 2019’s Super Bowl after a standout  
Washington won 42-10, and Williams was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to start in and win any NFL championship game, including those before the Super Bowl was established. 
Thirty-seven years ago on Jan. 31, 1988, Doug Williams stepped onto the field for Super Bowl XXII as the starting quarterback for the Washington Redskins (now Commanders) — and into history  
There was also Doug Williams, who led Washington past the Broncos in 1988 to become the first black quarterback to win the Super Bowl. These athletes excel as black QBs in the NFL. The reputations of black quarterbacks in the NFL are marked by groundbreaking careers and incredible athleticism. 
Two other Black quarterbacks made brief appearances in the pre-Super Bowl NFL. Willie Thrower, "the first black NFL quarterback of the modern mold", played for Michigan State in college before playing one professional game at quarterback for the Bears, in relief duty, on October 18, 1953. 
For the first time in history, two Black quarterbacks will face off in a game which will decide the championship of a professional football league — in the U.S., that is.. The outcome of Super  
Mahomes is the youngest player ever to win an NFL MVP, a Super Bowl MVP, and a Super Bowl. He was 24 when he first achieved that. He is a Black quarterback. 
On Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks walked all over the Denver Broncos, 43-8, to win Super Bowl XLVIII. Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson passed for 206 yards, ran for 26 more, threw two touchdowns  
Ahead of their historic matchup in Super Bowl LVII, where two Black QBs will go head to head for the very first time, Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts speak on the significance of their matchup. 
The NFL season began with a record 11 Black starting quarterbacks. It ends for the first time with two Black starting quarterbacks in the Super Bowl.. This Sunday's meeting, though, between the  </p>
