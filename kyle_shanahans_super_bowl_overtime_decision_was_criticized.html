        <p>Coach Kyle Shanahan said he alerted the position coaches to remind their small groups after the Kansas City Chiefs scored a late field goal to send Super Bowl LVIII into overtime at 19-19. “I did not cover it in a meeting on the Super Bowl week,” Shanahan said. “I don’t think that changes anything.” 
I touched on San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan's decision to take the ball first in overtime in my recap column last Monday, but after stories broke that some 49ers players didn't know the rules  
Kyle Shanahan and the San Francisco 49ers lost 25-22 in the Super Bowl against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs with a very controversial decision by the head coach in overtime. 
Shanahan’s decision to take the ball to open overtime was 100 percent the correct decision. However, his postgame explanation was flawed and it opened the door for an inordinate amount of second-guessing. The biggest reason why the 49ers made the correct decision to take the ball to open overtime was because of how regulation ended. 
The crux of the argument against Shanahan seems to be his decision to take the ball after winning the coin toss before overtime, the second in Super Bowl history and first in postseason play since

San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan defended his decision to receive the ball first in overtime following Sunday's 25-22 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII. 
Shanahan deserves plenty of criticism for the Super Bowl loss, but the decision to receive the ball first in overtime isn't one of them at all. Published Feb 15, 2024 JOSE LUIS SANCHEZ III 
San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan has an explanation for one of the most questionable decisions of his team's 25-22 overtime loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday. 
Kyle Shanahan stands by his decisions in the 49ers' heartbreaking Super Bowl LVIII overtime loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday at Allegiant Stadium.. Tied at 19 points at the end of regulation, the 49ers won the overtime coin flip and opted to start with the ball, which ultimately resulted in rookie kicker Jake Moody giving San Francisco a 22-19 lead on the opening drive before Chiefs  
I thought I was done with Super Bowl LVIII, but one conversation that keeps happening has pulled me back in.I touched on San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan's decision to take the ball first in overtime in my recap column last Monday, but after stories broke that some 49ers players didn't know the rules and video was released of the Chiefs celebrating Shanahan's decision on the sideline, it has  
However, Shanahan was criticized for being too aggressive by not using a ball-control running attack late in the game, a decision considered by many to have contributed to the Falcons losing their 25-point lead, as they eventually lost the game in overtime by a score of 34–28. 
Kyle Shanahan fell to 0-3 in the Super Bowl after Sunday’s loss to the Kansas City Chiefs — two losses as a head coach and one as an offensive coordinator. In all three games, his team held a
