History It's What We Do New Orleans has made the big game “super” in every decade dating back to 1970. Four times in the 70s, three times in the 80s, twice in the 90s and once in the 00s and 10s. We’ve seen Staubach, Bradshaw, Favre and Brady hoist the Vince Lombardi trophy, the Fridge 
Brett Favre threw two touchdown passes and ran for one score as the Packers won their first Super Bowl in 29 years. The big play was Desmond Howard’s 99-yard kickoff return in the third quarter. Howard, the Most Valuable Player, set a Super Bowl record with 244 return yards. 
The first Super Bowl held in New Orleans was Super Bowl IV on January 11, 1970, in which the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 at Tulane Stadium, which held a crowd of 81,000 people. This was the last championship match between the NFL and AFL before the leagues completely merged. 
And, for the coin toss, the winning head coaches of the previous six New Orleans Super Bowls were featured. New Orleans had cemented itself as a staple of the Super Bowl.

Favre’s Reaction. Favre, a Super Bowl champion and Green Bay Packers legend, took to social media to express his confusion. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, he asked, “What’s going on with the New Orleans and Trump Hotel story? A lot of information and hard to sift through to see what’s real!” 
The Green Bay Packers’ qualifying for Super Bowl XXXI was a feat in and of itself. The team’s last Super Bowl appearance was during Super Bowl II (1968) and finally turned around several decades of losing records with the help of two-time NFL MVP Brett Favre and the NFC’s best record (13-3). 
In the wake of the devastating attacks, Brett Favre, a former Super Bowl-winning quarterback, took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to express skepticism with his followers.
