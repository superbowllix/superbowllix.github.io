In addition to winning their fourth Super Bowl in team history, the Giants set a new record for the lowest regular season record (9–7, win percentage of 56.3%) by a Super Bowl champion. [12] The Patriots entered the game with a 13–3 regular season record, and were also seeking their fourth Super Bowl win. [ 13 ]

At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year.

The Giants became the first and only team in Super Bowl history to win Super Bowls in four different decades (1986, 1990, 2007, 2011). The Patriots became the first and only team in Super Bowl history to lose Super Bowls in four different decades (1985, 1996, 2007, 2011). 
The 2011 roster for the Giants included Eli Manning at quarterback, Ahmad Bradshaw at running back, Hakeem Nicks at wide receiver, Jake Ballard at tight end and David Diehl at offensive lineman. 
The Packers would also win Super Bowl II, and in 1970, the NFL would rename the “World Professional Football Championship Trophy” to the Vince Lombardi Trophy.  XLVI. Feb. 5, 2012. New York

The New York Giants served the New England Patriots a surprising 3-point upset in a game presumed to be a landslide opportunity for Tom Brady’s legendary Patriots. Super Bowl XLVI was New England’s one shot at redemption after an embarrassing conclusion to [] 
They became the first team to finish the regular season 9-7 and win the Super Bowl. New England had the ball for all of one play in the first 11 1-2 minutes, and that play was an utter failure, a  
Super Bowl XLVI was played on Feb. 5, 2012 and like its predecessor four years earlier, was a Giants-Patriots classic. Characteristic of both the Super Bowl showdowns and the Giants' 2011 season, the winners needed a late comeback orchestrated by Manning to win the game, 21-17.
