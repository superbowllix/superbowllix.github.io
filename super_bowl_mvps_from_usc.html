        <p>Super Bowl MVPs have come from colleges big and small, from the Division II ranks to powerhouses like Alabama.  USC - 3 (one each for Lynn Swann, Marcus Allen and Malcolm Smith) 
Smith attended William Howard Taft High School, where he was a letterman in football and track. [2] In football, he was named to the Student Sports Sophomore All-American and Cal-Hi Sports All-State first-team as a 2004 sophomore when he had 800-plus yards of total offense and 8 touchdowns, plus 2 interceptions, as Taft won the L.A. City title. 
Three USC football players have earned the Super Bowl MVP Award. Marcus Allen was the MVP for the Los Angeles Raiders in Super Bowl XVIII against the Washington Redskins in January of 1984. Malcolm Smith gave USC another Super Bowl MVP when he took home the hardware for Super Bowl XLVIII in February of 2014 against the Denver Broncos. 
The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's  
Some surprising schools on the list are represented by the 58 Super Bowl MVP winners. Whether you view that in the negative or positive light, it can be eye-opening. Perhaps that is due to the recency bias of Michigan being at the top. Some national powers on this list don't have a Super Bowl MVP that might surprise you such as Auburn, LSU, or

Jan 20, 1980; Pasadena, CA, USA; Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Lynn Swann (88) celebrates in the end zone during Super Bowl XIV against the Los Angeles Rams at the Rose Bowl. Pittsburgh went on and defeated the Rams 31-19 and earn their fourth Super Bowl Championship and their second back to back Super Bowl victory. 
In the 2013 season, Malcolm Smith became the first defensive player to win Super Bowl MVP in a decade. Smith’s career as a linebacker started at USC, where he posted solid stats from 2007-10. Smith posted numbers in the top 10 for the Pacific-10 Conference for assisted tackles and interception return yards. 
A total of 54 Super Bowls have been played. That number will grow to 55 after this upcoming Sunday evening. A total of 36 Super Bowls have been played since Marcus Allen’s reverse-of-field, change-of-direction, loop-and-cutback 74-yard touchdown run against the Washington Redskins in Tampa, the same city where Super Bowl LV will be contested between the Buccaneers and the Chiefs. 
Players who have won multiple Super Bowl MVP awards will be counted for each. ACC (6) Florida State (2) Fred Biletnikoff, WR, Oakland Raiders (Super Bowl XI) Dexter Jackson, S, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Super Bowl XXXVII) Louisville (1) Deion Branch, WR, New England Patriots (Super Bowl XXXIX) Miami (2) Ottis Anderson, RB, New York Giants (Super  
Super Bowl LVIII is on the horizon, with Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers set to face Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Both teams aim to claim the iconic Lombardi Trophy, while one player will etch their name in history as Super Bowl MVP. 
Mahomes enters Super Bowl 59 tied with Joe Montana for the second-most Super Bowl MVPs at three apiece. The only other players to win the award multiple times are Terry Bradshaw (2), Eli Manning  
However, a few universities do stand out. The University of Alabama, Purdue University, and University of Southern California (USC) each have produced three Super Bowl MVPs. - From the University of Alabama, Bart Starr, Joe Namath, and Julian Edelman were recognized as Super Bowl MVPs. 
For the second time in four years, the Chiefs won it all on the shoulders of Patrick Mahomes, who claimed his second Super Bowl MVP. Over the last 10 Super Bowl games, there have been seven players to claim the Most Valuable Player trophy. Of the 10 games, five belong to Mahomes and Tom Brady. 
The highlight of that game was Allen's iconic, 74-yard run on a sweep to the right side of the formation, where the USC product reversed field and outran the Washington defense to the end zone. 
USC now has 67 players that have won a Super Bowl in the NFL following the Tampa Bay Buccaneers win with Ronald Jones II.  Of the 55 Super Bowls, USC has featured an alumni in 48 of the sports
