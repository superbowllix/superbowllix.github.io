The Superbowl 53 is kicking off Sunday, February 3, 6:30 PM live from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, in Atlanta, Georgia. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots will play the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams to decide the league champion for the 2018 season. 
The NFL gives teams $4,000 for each Super Bowl ring, and team owners spend their own money to improve them. The rings Chicago Bears players received from the McCaskey family for Super Bowl XX cost $4,000. 
Many of those ads have delivered moments that are remembered as much as the games themselves. Ahead of Super Bowl LIX (Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX), here are the 10 greatest Super Bowl commercials  
25. Nationwide Insurance — 'Boy' Super Bowl: 46 (Feb. 5, 2012) This is the most controversial one on the list, not because of its humor — because there isn't any — but because of its pure  
A funny ad goes a long way, or at least it did for two amateur advertisers who won Doritos' "Crash the Super Bowl" contest in 2009, an ad contest where the winning commercial was played during the  
Here are 10 of the best Super Bowl commercials of all time, following the blueprint Apple established in 1984. “Budweiser Frogs” (Budweiser, 1995) A good ad doesn’t need to be complicated  
The Kellogg School Super Bowl Advertising Review, an annual ranking from Northwestern University’s business school, reported shortly after the game on Sunday that Reddit’s commercial was among  
The use of celebrities in a Super Bowl commercial doesn't get any better than Betty White getting laid out trying to catch a slant over the middle of the field. Snickers has done multiple  
The truncated commercial is probably the shortest to air this Super Bowl season, but its impact is undeniable. Kicking off with a pair of racing SUVs, the ad cuts to a screen with Reddit's  
I gathered this data myself, beginning at the exact time the official Super Bowl broadcast began (6:30 EST this year) and finishing at the end of the trophy presentation. The y axis represents the number of commercials or ads, of any sort, that appear throughout the broadcast. Repeats and duplicates were counted. 
I'm going to be grading every commercial as it goes, break by break. I'll update this comment with all of my ratings, and I'll also try to link to every commercial on youtube later. Grades are my personal opinion, and may change over the course of the night. Will be commenting in the main threads, and editing them onto this one. Cheers!

The Broncos have traded 3 first round picks, 3 second round picks, a third and a fourth round pick. And will pay Sean Payton and Russell Wilson a combined 335 million dollars, all to start the season 1-5 with the third worst point differential in the NFL 
Super Bowl commercials are stupid, too overhyped and they are just simply regular tv commercials with bigger bells and whistles! Not worth any hype. I know a ton of posts on this sub are actually semi popular posts and constantly get critiqued for being such.

Super Bowl commercials are stupid, too overhyped and they are just simply regular tv commercials with bigger bells and whistles!  r/Music — Reddit’s #1 Music  
The great Super Bowl commercials are the ones you still remember not matter how long they aired. To this day I still remember the Terry Tate Office Linebacker commercial and how hard it hit during a Super Bowl Party, everybody was laughing at that commercial. 
TSN Plus ($8 monthly, included with TSN) will show a "data-enhanced" stream of the Super Bowl. DAZN will carry the Super Bowl as part of NFL Game Pass International ($30 monthly). This is probably true in many other countries where NFL GPI is available on DAZN. None of these will carry all of the American commercials. 
I liked Larry David’s reluctance to new ideas a lot “I HAVE TEN FORKS RIGHT HERE!” And the NFL commercial where the video games characters came out. Lays with Seth and Paul was decent. I think the Super Bowl spots being the golden standard for commercials is no longer a thing. They’ve been flat for years now. Often just a few good ones. </p>
