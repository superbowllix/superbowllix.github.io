        <h2><strong>last super bowl over under tampa kc super bowl box score</strong></h2>
        <p>The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
The smallest Super Bowl spread of the past two decades was Seattle -1 against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX; The largest Super Bowl spread over the past 20 years was New England -12 versus the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII; Recent Super Bowls have been closer contests, with three of the last four games decided by just a field  
Taking out two pushes and one pick ’em game, favorites are 28-27 (51%) in the game against the spread. The over/under is split exactly down the middle with 29 games going over the total and 29 staying under (Super Bowl I had no over/under odds posted, but one would have to assume it would have gone over with 45 points scored). 
Super Bowl betting history has seen the underdog cash the past four years, with the Chiefs winning in that role in the last two. Check the chart below for ATS &amp; OVER/UNDER results in all Super Bowls. 
The Under has been the play lately, hitting in five of the last six Super Bowls. The Under barely hit last year, however, and the 2023 game between the Chiefs and Eagles was the only one to hit  
The Chiefs were a +1.5 underdog in last year's Super Bowl, and Kansas City escaped with a 38-35 win over the Eagles in one of the most exciting games in recent memory. 
The ‘over/under’ has gone 29-28 in the first 58 Super Bowl matchups. No total was posted on Super Bowl I between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. In the 2019 Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
Super Bowl XIX (19) Game: San Francisco 49ers vs. Miami Dolphins Spread: 49ers (-3) Over/Under: 53.5 SU Result: 49ers, 38-16 ATS Result: 49ers covered by 19 points Super Bowl XX (20) 
Here's a look at the past Super Bowl Over/Under history: Super Bowl LVI: Under (49.5 – Rams 23, Bengals 20) Super Bowl LV: Under (56 – Buccaneers 31, Chiefs 9) Super Bowl LIV: Under (53  
The Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers clashed in Super Bowl 58, a thrilling matchup that went down to the wire. With the over/under line set at 47.5, all eyes were on the scoreboard to see if the Super Bowl 58 Total would fall short or eclipse this modest number. Let’s take a quick trip down memory lane, and review Super Bowl  
Chiefs vs. Eagles Total for Super Bowl 59. OVER 48.5 (-110) UNDER 48.5 (-110)  I'm going to take the UNDER, despite the last two Chiefs Super Bowl wins hitting the OVER. 
We're looking at the 2025 Super Bowl Over/Under odds for the Feb. 9, NFL championship matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles.  It was a shootout when these teams last met in Super Bowl 57, with  
Heading into Super Bowl 59, the over has cashed in 4 straight Super Bowls and in 5 of the last 6. Country singer Reby McEntire sang the national anthem last year and it clocked in at a prompt 1:35. The anthem does typically come in at around 2 minutes, and a lot of what can determine whether the national anthem goes over or under is how long  
Recent Super Bowl Over/Under History. The Under has been the play lately, hitting in four of the last five Super Bowls. Last year’s game between the Chiefs and Eagles was the only one to hit the  
Highest Total (Over/Under): The highest total (over/under) in the Super Bowl was 58.5 points in Super Bowl 58.5, when the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34-28 in overtime. Lowest Total (Over/Under): 33 is the lowest total posted for the Super Bowl and it has happened four times: XXXV: Giants vs Ravens 
Super Bowl 57 Over/Under: Picks for betting the Chiefs-Eagles total  Mahomes and the Chiefs got smoked 31-9 by the Buccaneers when they last made the Super Bowl two postseasons ago, but they  
In last year's Super Bowl LVIII, Reba McEntire's rendition seemingly hit the Under on length. But an extra "brave" at the end technically sent the song Over. Ultimately, some sportsbooks ended up  
Heading into Super Bowl 59, the over has cashed in 4 straight Super Bowls and in 5 of the last 6. Country singer Reby McEntire sang the national anthem last year and it clocked in at a prompt 1:35. The anthem does typically come in at around 2 minutes, and a lot of what can determine whether the national anthem goes over or under is how long
