The wild thing about this particular Super Bowl matchup, though, is that the phenomenon of teams from the same cities facing off in two consecutive title games is very rare. By virtue of having Red Sox-Dodgers and Patriots-Rams both taking place in the 2018 (or 2018-2019 season), it marks the first time since Super Bowl III in 1969 that this
