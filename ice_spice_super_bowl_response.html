        <p>Rapper Ice Spice appeared slightly confused during Super Bowl LVIII, sparking many viral memes 
Ice Spice detailed her experience attending the Super Bowl with her friend Taylor Swift — and how she was 'confused' by some of the on-field action while appearing on 'The Tonight Show' on  
While many fans tuned into the 2024 Super Bowl to see Taylor Swift cheer on Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, it was Ice Spice who stole the show with her confused reactions to the rules of football. 
Ice Spice is not in her football era. The rapper, 24, recently revealed her confusion when attending Super Bowl LVIII alongside Taylor Swift. When reflecting on the game during Friday’s episo

Ice Spice, Taylor Swift's Friendship. Before getting invited to the Super Bowl LVIII, Ice Spice became one of Swift's fast friends last year. The pair collaborated for the remix version of "Karma  
Ice Spice looks confused at Super Bowl. The 24-year-old rapper arrived at the NFL championship on Sunday alongside Swift and Blake Lively. The trio watched the game from Kelce's VIP suite, where  
Videos of Ice Spice appearing bewildered during the Super Bowl gain viral traction on social media, prompting uproarious reactions from netizens. by Srijita Saha February 12, 2024 
Ice Spice said it was good timing for her first Super Bowl commercial, as her dad’s favorite team, the San Francisco 49ers, beat the Detroit Lions on Jan. 28 to make it to the championship. 
Basically Ice Spice is a young rapper. She's African-American and Dominican. She's already been nominated for a Grammy. She's not super, super famous but after the Super Bowl on Sunday she got more attention. She's a friend of Taylor Swift and she went to the game with her. At one point a photo of Jason Kelce talking to Ice Spice was released. 
Ice Spice throws up satanic signs and holds up upside cross while Taylor Swift downs beer at the Super Bowl 
Ice Spice has yet another celebrity admirer after bumping into Shaquille O’Neal at the Super Bowl.. Taking to Instagram on Monday (February 12), the NBA legend posted a picture of himself with  
Ice Spice admitted what many fans had been speculating when they saw the rapper in a private suite with Taylor Swift at Super Bowl LVIII. When the 34-year-old was in Las Vegas to support her partner Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs take on the San Francisco 49ers for a Super Bowl championship, Swift brought along a bevy of her friends. 
Ice Spice responded to the growing buzz around her size with a SpongeBob SquarePants meme, using humor to brush off the scrutiny.. Reports state that she received comments about her weight after posting new images of herself on Instagram on Friday (Dec. 6). 
No, Ice Spice did not make satanic signs nor wear an upside-down cross with demonic intentions at Super Bowl 58. The pendant, designed by Alex Moss, represents the Cross of St. Peter, a symbol of humility and martyrdom in Catholic tradition, not satanism. Unraveling The Unholy Mystery: Ice Spice Pendant Explained 
Ice Spice was born and raised in The Bronx, New York, a huge epicenter of hip-hop music. This melting pot of African-American and Dominican cultures provides a fertile ground for artistic development. 
About. Ice Spice's Satanic Hand Gestures and Upside-Down Cross at Super Bowl LVIII refers to conspiracy theories that rapper Ice Spice was purposely flashing supposed satanic hand signs and wearing an upside-down cross necklace at Super Bowl LVIII in mid-February 2024 whenever the camera switched to her sitting next to Taylor Swift. 
Nevertheless, not all Super Bowl viewers saw red, as many highlighted Ice Spice’s feared hand gestures as the classic “rock on” sign, which she did while music was playing, HuffPost reported. 
Also to give more context to understand the jokes. Jason Kelce is the older brother of Taylor Swift’s boyfriend Travis. Jason is recently retired future hall of fame football player in his own right but generally jokingly known as the more well meaning and even tempered of the two brothers if a bit of a fun-dopey super dad to his three daughters. </p>
