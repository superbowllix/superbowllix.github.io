        <h2><strong>usher super bowl first song predictions sheryl lee ralph super bowl black national anthem</strong></h2>
        <p>We're offering our top Super Bowl halftime show first song predictions based on the best NFL odds, with a focus on Usher's hit single "Yeah!" (+700). 
“Yeah!” is tempting since its odds have climbed after opening as the favorite, but I’ll go with “DJ Got Us Fallin’ In Love” at +800 odds. To start, you need an upbeat, fast-paced song (unlike “Burn”) with a recognizable opening rift. “DJ” satisfies both requirements. Lock in our NFL expert’s Super Bowl 58 Same Game Parlay at +700 odds. 
What will Usher's first song be at the Super Bowl halftime show? "My Way," "OMG" or "Yeah" all are safe bets for Usher's opening song at the Super Bowl 58 halftime show. Let's be a 
Additionally, he's predicted to close his awaited performance with the chart-topping collaboration with David Guetta, "Without You," marking Usher's testament to his versatility and making it a memorable conclusion. Check out the graphs below for a deep dive into the first and last song predictions. 
The big question that BetMGM has posed to the bettors is what will Usher's first song be? The sportsbook has 10 songs with odds. The favorite for the first song is Usher's "My Way" at -110. The next most likely is "OMG" at +150 odds. After those two, there is a significant drop-off. "Love in This Club" and "Yeah!" are both at +700 odds at BetMGM. 
If you’re looking to make a safe bet on the Super Bowl Halftime show props, taking Yeah! as the first performed song might be the way to go. The 2004 chart-topper featuring rappers Lil Jon and Ludacris is Usher’s most iconic song and a +225 favorite in the odds. 
According to Breen, each song only needs to be played for 10 seconds to qualify, so our prediction is that fans will be treated to at least nine distinctly different snippets on Sunday. Prediction: 
Eight-time Grammy Award winner Usher will be headlining the Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show. The singer, songwriter, actor, dancer and businessman will hit the stage after two 
Our picks for Usher's Super Bowl halftime show prop bets, including the first song, last song, and potential guests. 
First song prediction: OMG. The Super Bowl halftime show is a sprint, not a marathon. Performers are trying to jam a careers worth of hit songs into a 12-15 minute window, with most shows averaging 13 minutes.

Super Bowl halftime prop bets: Usher last song odds. Similar to how you can bet on Usher’s first song to be performed, you can also bet on the last song to be performed at the Super Bowl halftime show. These songs are based on the final 10 seconds played in the show. Let’s take a look at the Super Bowl halftime odds: 
To summarize my Super Bowl halftime predictions, they are: Yes (first song is “Humble”, closer is “Not Like Us”) (+750) Anderson Paak to appear (+600) Squabble Up as first song off GNX (-140) Not Like Us to close (+230) Under 10.5 songs (-115) Yes to wearing a bandana at some point (-115) No to wearing a hoodie for first song (-115)
