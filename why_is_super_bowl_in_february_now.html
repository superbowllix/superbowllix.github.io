        <h2><strong>why is super bowl in february now super bowl restaurant promotions</strong></h2>
        <p>Aside from a January game in 2003, the Super Bowl was held on the first Sunday in February going forward. That schedule shifted a second time in 2021, when the NFL elected to add another regular  
The Super Bowl was first played in February in 2004, held on the first day of the month, for the XXXVIII edition of the game, between the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers. It was held on the first Sunday of the month until 2021, when it subsequently moved to 2022 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic with Super Bowl LVI. 
An 18 th regular season game could push the Super Bowl to the third week of February – lining it up with Presidents Day Weekend and creating a holiday for many fans the day after the Super Bowl. 
The Super Bowl then had to be shifted a week, too, from the first to the second Sunday in February. This isn't the first time the date for the Super Bowl has changed. 
Super Bowl" became official beginning with the third annual game. [15] Roman numerals are used to identify each Super Bowl, rather than the year in which it is held, since the fifth edition, in January 1971. [16] The sole exception to this naming convention tradition occurred with Super Bowl 50, played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015  
The biggest reason the Super Bowl is played on Sunday is simple: TV ratings. In a 2018 interview, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell made it clear that audience size drives the decision. 
Super Bowl Sunday is the day on which the Super Bowl, the National Football League (NFL)'s annual championship game, is played. It was the first Sunday in February from Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 until Super Bowl LV in 2021, but is now the second Sunday, beginning with Super Bowl LVI . 
The Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, Feb. 9 in 2025. That will continue the NFL's new tradition – which began after the league expanded the season to 17 games – of hosting the game on the  
Super Bowl LVIII (which stands for Super Bowl 58) kicks off on Sunday, Feb. 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, around 6:30 p.m. Eastern (5:30 p.m. Central Time, 4:30 p.m. Mountain Time  
Super Bowl LVIII (which stands for Super Bowl 58) kicks off on Sunday, Feb. 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada, around 6:30 p.m. Eastern (5:30 p.m. Central Time, 4:30 p.m. Mountain Time  
With the extra game, that means the regular season is now 18 weeks long, which means the Super Bowl is now being moved back from the first Sunday in February to the second Sunday in February. The fact that Super Bowl LVII is being held on Feb. What year did the Super Bowl move to February? Super Bowl history The first game took place back in  
Each year, the Super Bowl starts sometime around 6:30 Eastern. This is the story of why this happens, and the first time the league ever played the game in p 
This Sunday, the Philadelphia Eagles will be pitted against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX held at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Temple University sport business faculty member Rick Ridall discusses why this year’s average Super Bowl ticket price of $6,304, as of Monday is down roughly 33% from last year's median ticket price of $9,400. 
Over 300,000 fans are boycotting Super Bowl LIX, and the controversy is only growing.  Watch now to find out why fans are turning away from the biggest game of the year! Producer: Hammad  
The ticket resale market for Super Bowl LIX is crashing, and historic hotel pricing in New Orleans is a primary factor. Low-end, get-in pricing for the game across multiple marketplaces is now hovering around $3,300 per seat, down by nearly 30% from levels seen a week ago, after the Chiefs-Eagles matchup was set. 
We now have the Stephen A. Smith generation screaming over colleagues. Most everything in sports today is bolder, louder.  (15) pose with the trophy during Super Bowl 59 Opening Night, Monday  
Super Bowl 2023 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles is scheduled to be played on Sunday, February 12. However, the date of the game being played this year is later than usual. 
With the right coaching, a healthy roster, and a quarterback playing at a high level, the Lions are primed to make their Super Bowl dream a reality. It’s not just hope—it’s a well-earned belief that the Detroit Lions will WIN Super Bowl LX and end a decades-long championship drought. Get ready, Detroit—it’s time to celebrate! 
People who are saying "bye week"' are only telling you how the league is able to push the Super Bowl into February. It doesn't explain why the league is doing it. I believe TV ratings is the reason why Super Bowls are being played in February these days. February (and November) are called "sweeps" months in TV lingo. Those are the times when  
Regardless of what happens in Super Bowl LIX, history will be made. As you likely know, with a win at New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome on Sunday, Feb. 16, the Chiefs become the first NFL team to  </p>
