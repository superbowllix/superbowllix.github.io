The MPV award is given to the most valuable player in the Super Bowl final. The award is currently decided by a fan vote during the game (20%) and by a panel of 16 American football writers and broadcasters who vote after the game (80%). Quarterbacks have won the award more than 50% of the time. See more Super Bowl MVP Trivia.

The Super Bowl MVP voting system is a bit complex. The MVP is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel’s ballots count for 80% of the vote tally, while the viewers’ ballots make up the other 20%. 
A quarterback has taken home MVP honors in 32 of the 58 Super Bowls. The position with the second-most Super Bowl MVPs is wide receiver, at eight. Here’s a full breakdown of Super Bowl MVP  
There have been a total of 57 Super Bowl MVPs handed out in the history of the NFL, yet only 48 players have actually received a Most Valuable Player trophy given out after the league championship game takes place. Here is the Complete list of NFL players to ever win Super Bowl MVP honor from SB I to LVII ( 1967-2024). 
Super Bowl History of MVPs by year with team and position included. Also included below is the number of times each player has won multiple Super Bowl MVP awards (1967-2024). &lt; SUPER BOWL PAGE  
Patrick Mahomes doubled up his second regular-season MVP with his second Super Bowl MVP trophy in leading the Kansas City Chiefs to a thrilling, come-from-behind 38-35 victory in Super Bowl LVII  
Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls. Since 1990, the award has been presented by the NFL. At Super Bowl XXV, the league introduced the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, for the Super Bowl MVP. Ottis Anderson was the first to win this trophy. NFL Super Bowl MVP List 
A total of seven QBs have won both NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP. Patrick Mahomes was the last to accomplish the feat, having done so in 2023. Here is the full list of players who won both an NFL MVP  
He was the first quarterback to throw for more than 4,000 yards and rush for more than 800 as he totaled 5,087 yards. He had the fourth-highest passer rating of all time, finishing at 119.6. 
Lynn Swann became the first receiver to win the Super Bowl MVP after a Super Bowl-record 161-yard performance, nabbing a 64-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help put the trailing Steelers  
We are days away from Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers where one player will receive the honor of the Most Valuable Player once the confetti falls. There have been 57 Super Bowl MVP Awards handed out for the title game in NFL history but only 47 men can call themselves Super Bowl MVP Winners.

The end of the 2003-2004 season brought Tom Brady his second Super Bowl and one more Super Bowl MVP award. In the final game, Brady threw for 354 yards and three touchdowns and recorded 32 completions, the most made by a quarterback in a Super Bowl. 
Over the past couple of decades, the Super Bowl has been the stage to some truly iconic performances from legendary players, and equally memorable surprise showings from more unsung stars. Let’s take a look back at the Super Bowl MVP winners since 2000, the top performers from a fascinating era of football. Super Bowl MVPs Since 2000 
The first overall pick of the 1989 NFL Draft, Aikman played 12 consecutive seasons as the starting quarterback with the Cowboys, the most number of seasons by any Cowboy quarterback. During his career he was a six-time Pro Bowl selection, led the team to three Super Bowl victories, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXVII. 
Three Super Bowl wins, three Super Bowl MVPs, two NFL MVPs, two first-team All-Pros, six Pro Bowls, and nothing less than an AFC Championship appearance in his seven years as a starter. Super Bowl 59 will be Mahomes' fifth Super Bowl he's started, so it's almost become routine for him with the comings and goings leading up to the big game. 
The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom. 
A Super Bowl MVP would certainly put a bow on Barkley's impeccable 2024-25 season, which might be the most dominating regular-season and playoff campaign by a running back in NFL history. </p>
