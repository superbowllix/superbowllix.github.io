        <h2><strong>super bowl winner predictions reddit super bowl 2025 game video</strong></h2>
        <p>Spags has been a part of three Super Bowl championship teams. CMC was not on the field in that last Super Bowl, and he stands to get 20-plus touches in this game. Samuel against Sneed will be a must-watch matchup. Kittle is the key player for the Niners, going up against Bolton, who was a star in last year’s Super Bowl. 
Right, I’m kind of considering this actually. Steichen engineered a Super Bowl offense two years ago. It’s possible Richardson goes nuclear; he has the physical capacity and coaching staff to do so. They really weren’t even bad last year. +3500 to win AFC isn’t quite as compelling but should be noted.

2024-25 Super Bowl predictions: Experts pick who will play in, win SB LIX  facebook x reddit link. FOX Sports NFL Staff  (Betting odds to win Super Bowl via DraftKings as of 9/4). 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles meet in Super Bowl 59 and experts are split on who will win. Here are the latest predictions and odds: 
Why: Another close win for the Chiefs to complete the three-peat as Chris Jones takes advantage of the Eagles' OL injuries to win Super Bowl MVP. Mike Band: Chiefs 24, Eagles 20 
More than 60 experts picked the winner of Eagles-Chiefs, including the final score of the game and who they think will win Super Bowl MVP. Here's a breakdown of their picks, plus betting odds from  
The season is closing and we're in for a pretty great matchup. I hope you were all able to do well in your predictions this year and come out over .500. For the Championship games, I went 0-2, bringing me to 8-4. I've heard this matchup being called the Reid Bowl, or the Kelce Bowl. I'm just hoping for a great game. Here we go! 
But you can hedge out of futures for guaranteed profit. If the 9ers win this week, my +2500 super bowl ticket will be some easy guaranteed cash. I will agree that after the wildcard round, there's very little value on futures. At this point just bet individual games. 
Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money.

Every year, some friends and I like to make our own predictions for how the season will play out. We pick the 7 playoff teams from each conference, in order, and pick the main awards. We also make our Super Bowl picks, and then we share our predictions with each other and see how they held up after the season. 
I know a ton has to go right for this to happen, but it’s a bold prediction for a reason. Just wanted to get it on the record and put the notion into the universe. The Lions miss the playoffs in 2022, win their first playoff game this millennium in 2023, followed by a historic Super Bowl victory in 2024. You heard it here first. 
Right now their path looks easier which improves their odds of winning. The Bucs are in front of you because Tom Brady is their QB, and if we don’t put Tom at the front of these lists, he will get mad and win the Super Bowl. 
I’ve been tracking the Superbowl odds every week since the start of the season. Odds are all pulled from DraftKings before each week kicks off on Thursdays. So the latest odds are the odds entering Week 7. I cut the chart off at +10,000 because it’s too hard to read otherwise. So the bottom teams have fallen off already. 
The Super Bowl is set. Let's make our picks and score predictions for the big game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. In a rematch of Super Bowl 57, KC and Philly again battle for Lombardi Trophy, the hardest trophy to win in all of sports. The stakes are a lot different in this one, too. </p>
