        <h2><strong>super bowl trophy by team what super bowl did kansas city win</strong></h2>
        <p>The Jets' most recent championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002  
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. [1] 
Of the 28 franchises to have played in a Super Bowl, 20 have actually won a championship. And a whopping 30 of the 56 Super Bowls have been won by just six franchises. 
Two NFL teams have won the Super Bowl a record six times, the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Patriots' last title was 2018. 
Super Bowl 50: Denver Broncos 24, Carolina Panthers 10 MVP: Von Miller | Location: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif. | Date: Feb. 7, 2016; Super Bowl XLIX: New  
The NFL casts a new trophy every year to award to the Super Bowl champion. The Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots have the most Lombardi Trophies with six. The 49ers can claim their  
An MVP has been honored for every Super Bowl, but the trophy, which is named after longtime NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, was first given out at Super Bowl 25. And one player in this year’s Big  
There’s a reason why Vince Lombardi has the Super Bowl trophy named after him: the Packers were dominant in the 1960s.  Eventually, there may be a team with more Super Bowl wins, but for now  
Winning a Super Bowl and being part of a team that lifts the Lombardi Trophy is no easy task, and therefore when the moment finally arrives, it is hard to put in words just exactly the emotions of  
The trophy costs $50,000 to produce and takes four months and 72 hours of labor to complete. Do Players Get Their Own Super Bowl Lombardi Trophy? Due to the labor-intensive project to create the Lombardi Trophy, players don’t get to take one home that is an exact match. Instead, each player on the winning team gets to take home a small  
As the Kansas City Chiefs aim for a Super Bowl three-peat at Super Bowl LIX when they face the Philadelphia Eagles in a repeat of the 2023 NFL showpiece, both teams will be aiming to get their hands on the coveted Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Chiefs have won four Lombardi’s to date, including three  
Every team that wins the Super Bowl receives its own Vince Lombardi Trophy. The trophy is engraved with the team’s name and the year of their victory, making each one a unique symbol of that  
The Lombardi Trophy is awarded annually to the winner of the Super Bowl, crowning that team as the NFL champion. It was first presented to the Green Bay Packers on Jan. 15, 1967, at the conclusion  
Currently, the trophy is named for the Green Bay Packers head coach whose teams won the first two Super Bowls. To many, that trophy name seems as embedded in league lore as the NHL’s Stanley Cup. Belichick now coaches the University of North Carolina Tar Heels, but Brady led the Pats to six Super Bowl victories with Belichick as head coach  
Super Bowl LIX is set as the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will go head-to-head for the Vince Lombardi Trophy in New Orleans on Sunday evening. A lot is on the line for both teams. 
Winning the Super Bowl and hoisting the Lombardi Trophy is the ultimate goal for every team at the beginning of the season. The emotional and physical journey to reach the Super Bowl, overcome formidable opponents, and emerge victorious is encapsulated in the gleaming trophy that awaits the champions. Notable Lombardi Trophy Moments 
After the Green Bay Packers won Super Bowl I, league officials presented the team with the first trophy. In 1971, the NFL renamed the trophy in honor of legendary coach Vince Lombardi. Unlike the  
Each year, one team in the NFL takes home the Lombardi Trophy after winning the Super Bowl. What is the history of the iconic trophy? Lombardi Trophy History The Vince Lombardi Trophy has been the  </p>
