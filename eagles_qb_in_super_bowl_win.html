        <h2><strong>eagles qb in super bowl win super bowl top performances</strong></h2>
        <p>Hurts does not have a Super Bowl ring, as he is 0-1 in big game. However, when the Eagles played the Chiefs in Super Bowl 57, Hurts had one of the better performances for quarterbacks in a losing  
The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, who was considering walking away from professional football just last offseason, won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award after leading Philly past the  
Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
The Eagles have won just one Super Bowl during their franchise's history. That came in Super Bowl 52, which was played in 2018 as part of the 2017 NFL playoffs. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33  Philadelphia had overcome a late-season ACL tear by QB Carson Wentz and  
Philadelphia won its first and only Lombardi Trophy in the 2017 season, when backup quarterback Nick Foles and the Eagles took down the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots in Super Bowl 52  
Nick Foles completed his fairy-tale season by leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a win in Super Bowl LII and being named the game's MVP. Jeffri Chadiha chronicles an unbelievable run. 
With this win, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl and their first NFL title since 1960. [9] Both teams managed to set an all-time NFL record for total combined yards in a game (1,151), and the 74 game points were one short of the Super Bowl record set in 1995. [10] [11] 
Foles’ TD pass to Ertz moments later gave the Eagles the lead for good. There have only been three 4 th-quarter 4 th-down completed passes in Super Bowl history by a team that was trailing, and Foles’ completion to Ertz is the only one that led to a win. One of the most clutch throws in Super Bowl history. 10. 
There was the overlooked quarterback, the underestimated head coach, and the demoted general manager, all of whom banded together to form the foundation of Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl-winning team. The 2017-18 Eagles embodied the spirit and the persona and the bite of their hometown. A team of  
What Is the Eagles’ Super Bowl Record? The Eagles have a 1-3 record in the Super Bowls they’ve appeared in. How Many Super Bowls Have the Eagles Won? The Eagles have won one Super Bowl. Super Bowl Wins by the Eagles. While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. 
In the history of the Philadelphia Eagles, the 2017 season stands alone. It’s not hard to understand why. It’s because the Eagles won the one and only Super Bowl in franchise history that year  
Now he will try to become the fourth quarterback to win the NFL’s ultimate prize as a starting quarterback after losing his first Super Bowl start. Hurts came close two years ago when Philadelphia lost 38-35 to Kansas City in Glendale, Arizona. With a win next week in New Orleans, Hurts would become the first quarterback since John Elway 27  
He earned Super Bowl MVP honors after leading the Eagles to a 41-33 win over the Patriots. Need a reminder? The 2017 championship banner hangs inside Lincoln Financial Field. 
Their first Super Bowl win came seven years ago, when quarterback Nick Foles and coach Doug Pederson led the 2017 Eagles to a 41-33 defeat of the New England Patriots. 
The Eagles last made the Super Bowl just two seasons ago against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 57. During that season, Jalen Hurts first emerged as an MVP candidate. His partnership with head coach Nick Sirianni immediately led to outstanding results for the team, which ran through the NFC with an unreal average margin of victory (27.5  
Quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley rushed in three touchdowns each as the Philadelphia Eagles reached the Super Bowl with a 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders in the NFC  
With a win, Hurts would be the third QB to win a College Championship and a Super Bowl as a starter. He would join Joe Namath and Joe Montana as the only players to accomplish the feat. If Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley combine for 27 yards in the Super Bowl, they will break the record for most rushing yards in a season by 2 players on the same  
The first Black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl, he was named the game's MVP and went on to a long career as an NFL coach and executive.  The youngest quarterback in Eagles  </p>
