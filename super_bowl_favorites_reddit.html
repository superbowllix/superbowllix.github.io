Confidence: Low - In three previous Super Bowl appearances, Mahomes has a 61.8% completion with five TDs and four INTs. He was clutch in the Super Bowl victories against the Niners and Eagles. Kelce has 23 receptions on 27 targets with 257 yards and three TDs in the playoffs, and that is going to be the key matchup against Warner and Greenlaw. 
The question really isn't "who has the highest likelihood of winning super bowl 59", it was about value, and the Browns looked way stronger this year than their record and seed, and the Colts probably should have won that division this year and will be much stronger in 2024.

My heart wants Cincy to win but I think the Rams experience in the Super Bowl will give them the slight edge. I have this game playing out like Pittsburgh/Arizona SB43 did. A couple of exciting late lead changes, but ultimately the Rams come out on top. SUPER BOWL 56 
Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money.

I’ve been tracking the Superbowl odds every week since the start of the season. Odds are all pulled from DraftKings before each week kicks off on Thursdays.

Yup. Such is life. Not sure what both franchises have done to deserve this. Another interesting fact: the Chargers have won the AFC west 15 season, which matches the Raiders, Chiefs, &amp; Broncos who all have multiple SB's. It took the Chiefs winning the AFC west the last 7 straight seasons to match the Chargers for 
Every year, some friends and I like to make our own predictions for how the season will play out. We pick the 7 playoff teams from each conference, in order, and pick the main awards. We also make our Super Bowl picks, and then we share our predictions with each other and see how they held up after the season.

The season is closing and we're in for a pretty great matchup. I hope you were all able to do well in your predictions this year and come out over .500. For the Championship games, I went 0-2, bringing me to 8-4. I've heard this matchup being called the Reid Bowl, or the Kelce Bowl. I'm just hoping for a great game. Here we go! 
Take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I think odds-wise, the Ravens don't beat the 49ers a second time around. My rationale: regardless of how lucky or not the bounces were (let's give the Ravens credit), the odds of another 5 turnover game is pretty slim, and even with all those turnovers the Niners were only down by 6 points at the half. </p>
