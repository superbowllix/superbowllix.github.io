        <p>Ten years ago, Jordan Mailata watched the Super Bowl for the first time. The then-17-year-old only cared about one thing: The halftime show. 
Jordan Mailata’s path from rugby to the NFL is one of the league’s greatest stories. Now, the Eagles left tackle is a key player in Super Bowl 2025. 
Monday’s Super Bowl will feature Australian Jordan Mailata, a former rugby league junior. How did he become such a brilliant NFL player? 
Unfortunately, no Australian has won the game that matters most every year but Mailata has a chance in his second Super Bowl, against the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday morning.

Considering the first ever down of football he ever played came in the NFL, the 27-year-old Mailata is still blown away that all of this – the games in front of tens of thousands of screaming fans, the bright lights of the Super Bowl, the appearance on “The Masked Singer,” the Christmas albums he’s recorded with his teammates – is real.

Ten years ago, Jordan Mailata watched the Super Bowl for the first time. The then-17-year-old only cared about one thing: The halftime show.
