        <p>The #2 seed has also done well in the Super Bowl, with the AFC's #2 seed winning six Super Bowls since 1975, and the NFC's #2 seed winning four Super Bowls. Funnily enough, the #4 seed has managed to win the Super Bowl seven times since 1975, with AFC teams accounting for four of these wins. #3, #5 and #6 seeds have all won the Super Bowl twice  
They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, giving them four Super Bowl appearances in five years and putting them one win away from three consecutive Super Bowl titles.

The Rams were also the #4 seed in the NFC who defeated the #2 seed to play the SB in their home stadium. Your chances of winning improve drastically once you get to the big game. 
Here's a look at the wild-card Super Bowl winners they could join.  The 1975 Dallas Cowboys were the first wild-card team to reach the Super Bowl. As a No. 4 seed, Dallas won two playoff games

Now they would become the only franchise in the modern playoff era to win a Super Bowl as the No. 6 seed and lose a Super Bowl to a 6-seed. The Packers built leads of 14-0 in the second quarter and 21-10 in the third, then held on to beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round 21-16, sealing the victory by intercepting Michael Vick in
