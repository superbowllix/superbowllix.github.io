        <h2><strong>philadelphia eagles super bowl win quarterback super bowl xlviii ring</strong></h2>
        <p>Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
The Eagles won their first Super Bowl in 2018 over the New England Patriots. It was an improbable victory given the team started their backup quarterback, Nick Foles. Police greased the poles in  
The Eagles also appeared in the Super Bowl two years ago but lost to the Chiefs in Super Bowl 57.. Eagles Super Bowl appearances. Entering Super Bowl 59 this year, Philadelphia has been to four  
Philadelphia's first Super Bowl appearance was a 27-10 loss to the then-Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 15. Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett threw for three touchdowns while Eagles signal-caller Ron  
Despite a late surge by the Patriots, the Eagles’ defense, led by Brandon Graham, made a crucial strip-sack of Brady in the final minutes. Philadelphia emerged victorious with a 41-33 win, and Nick Foles was named Super Bowl MVP. The triumph marked the franchise’s first Super Bowl win and solidified their place in NFL history. 
PHILADELPHIA – He was the only quarterback to win a Super Bowl for the Eagles. That at least should stamp Nick Foles’ legitimacy as one of the best five quarterbacks in franchise history  
Foles’ TD pass to Ertz moments later gave the Eagles the lead for good. There have only been three 4 th-quarter 4 th-down completed passes in Super Bowl history by a team that was trailing, and Foles’ completion to Ertz is the only one that led to a win. One of the most clutch throws in Super Bowl history. 10. 
While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
The Philadelphia Eagles won their first-ever Super Bowl championship Sunday night, beating the New England Patriots, 41-33. 
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles  
Carson Wentz once again will mostly be a spectator on the sidelines during a Super Bowl appearance by the Philadelphia Eagles. Seven years after he watched his backup Nick Foles win the MVP after delivering the Eagles their first Super Bowl title, Wentz is back on the big stage as a backup to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes as the Chiefs prepare to take on his former team and his former backup  
When Super Bowl 59 kicks off, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will become one of just two active players to start in multiple Super Bowls, joining his counterpart, Patrick Mahomes. The two signal

Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
The Philadelphia Eagles, a historic NFL franchise, have won one Super Bowl in their history, famously clinching the title in 2018.This win came after a stellar 2017 season, where the team, led by backup quarterback Nick Foles, triumphed over Tom Brady's New England Patriots in Super Bowl 52. 
The Philadelphia Eagles ran their way to the Super Bowl. The Eagles tied an NFL playoff record with seven touchdown runs in the NFC title game win over Washington, matching the mark Chicago set against Washington in the 1940 NFL title game. 
In the history of the Philadelphia Eagles, the 2017 season stands alone. It’s not hard to understand why. It’s because the Eagles won the one and only Super Bowl in franchise history that year  
Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, Nelson Agholor, Zach Ertz, Trey Burton, Brent Celek, Jay Ajayi, LeGarrette Blount, and Corey Clement all had critical roles as skill-position players in the win. No Eagles player accumulated more than 1,000 yards this year, making it the first team to win the Super Bowl with that stat since the New York Giants in
