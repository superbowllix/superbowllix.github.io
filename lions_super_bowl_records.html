Free Press sports writer Dave Birkett highlights the best and worst performances of the Detroit Lions’ 48-42 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday at Ford Field..

The Lions have won four NFL championships, all of which pre-date the existence of the Super Bowl. The Lions' four championships are tied for the tenth most total championships amongst all 32 NFL franchises; [7] the last of these was in 1957, which gives the club the second-longest NFL championship drought behind the Arizona Cardinals.
