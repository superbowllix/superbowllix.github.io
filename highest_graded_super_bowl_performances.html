        <p>The best Super Bowl performance by a quarterback we have ever seen belongs to Rodgers in his one and only appearance — and it’s not even close. Rodgers had a 94.2 passing grade in his Super Bowl 45 victory over Pittsburgh and gathered up nine big-time throws while going without a single turnover-worthy play. 
Completions: 22 for 25, 268 yards, three touchdowns Quarterback rating: 150.9. Simms’ performance against the Broncos was the single-most efficient game in Super Bowl history. 
Following Mahomes' performance in Sunday night's 25-22 overtime win over the 49ers, we've decided to come up with a ranking of the top quarterback performances in Super Bowl history. This was the  
Super Bowl III: New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7. Passer rating: 9.3. Passing stats: 6-for-17, 71 yards, 0 TD/3 INT. In the first game to be officially dubbed “Super Bowl” — the first two iterations were known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game and retroactively renamed — Morrall and the Colts went down to Joe Namath and the Jets in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. 
The first of Aikman’s three Super Bowl victories was his best: He completed 22-of-30 for 273 yards, four touchdowns and zero interceptions in a 52–17 rout of the Bills. 
Joe Montana’s Super Bowl QB performance in 1990 is the best of all time because his stat sheet combined both of what made Young and Simms’ games so memorable. The Super Bowl XXIV MVP had an  
The Super Bowl is the biggest event in American sports and many of the game's greatest all-time quarterbacks have been labeled either a legend or a disappointment based on their Super Bowl performances and whether or not their team took home championship rings.The best quarterbacks in NFL history 
The 2020-21 NFL season has nearly reached its conclusion; the Super Bowl 55 matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers is firmly in sight.. Many players have cemented or created their legacies in Super Bowls of old; some have even produced the best single game of their careers on the game's biggest stage. 
Facing an equally determined foe in Roger Staubach, Bradshaw put together his best Super Bowl performance, throwing for 318 yards and four touchdowns. Both were records at the time. 19. 
What is the record for completions in a Super Bowl? Tom Brady and Peyton Manning dominate this list. They have five of the top 10 performances in terms of completions, though there is a key difference between the two – Brady’s three appearances on the list all came in wins against the Atlanta Falcons (No. 1), Seattle Seahawks (No. 2) and Carolina Panthers (tied for No. 4), while Manning  
It would have been shit if he was a fumble machine all year and it's rough that it happened in the Super Bowl but fumbles happen especially with more mobile QBs. My biggest takeaway is that Jalen Hurts balled the hell out and spent four quarters showing everyone that he was the best player on that field. 
The way PFF grades work is that super negative plays don't actually affect a grade that much the same way it might for EPA. Which can be good, but it underrates the damage of a play like Hurts singlehandedly losing the ball untouched and spotting the other team 7 points. 
The last time the two teams faced, the Chiefs pulled out a late fourth-quarter comeback to win 31-20 and secure their first-ever Super Bowl win. Since then, they’ve been the dominant team in the NFL, and Super Bowl 58 will be their fourth Super Bowl appearance in the last five years. The 49ers will be looking to right the wrongs of Super Bowl 54.

Not bad at all, but Manning’s play in Super Bowl XLII pales in comparison to his performance in Super Bowl XLVI, which is one of the highest-graded Super Bowl performances in history. 2. ELI  
PFF gave Nick Foles the highest Super Bowl grade by any quarterback since 2006. Jalen Hurts had the second-best grade.  Foles' performance against Bill Belichick's defense was one for the ages  
The highest graded official in each different position is then chosen for the play-offs and the Super Bowl. So even though there is a lot of noise about them, the team for Sunday has been the best  
2. Phil Simms, Super Bowl XXI Denver led Super Bowl XXI at halftime by the score of 10-9. But in the second half, Simms led the Giants to 24 straight points without throwing a single incomplete  
The narrative highlights the seven best Super Bowl quarterback performances in NFL history, showcasing standout games that resonate with fans. Top performances include Nick Foles leading the Eagles to victory over the Patriots, Joe Namath's iconic upset with the Jets , and Joe Montana's remarkable efficiency, culminating in his legendary
