        <h2><strong>quarterbacks to win super bowl on rookie contract super bowl teams lineup</strong></h2>
        <p>Seneca Wallace didn't win in his rookie season in Super Bowls in Super Bowl XL versus the Steelers on February 5, 2006. 
Since 2000, there have been only 9 of a total 23 Super Bowl winning quarterbacks to win the big game on a rookie deal. One notable exception is the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles who were led by second-year quarterback Carson Wentz much of the season until a torn ACL resulted in veteran Nick Foles stepping in and leading the team to a championship. 
Rookie quarterbacks have made the AFC and NFC championship games but have not gone on to the Super Bowl. These include Ben Roethlisberger, Joe Flacco and Mark Sanchez. NFL rookie QBs have a lowly  
One of the most compelling storylines in this year's NFL postseason is 49ers rookie Brock Purdy being are a win away from a Super Bowl appearance.  QB has won a Super Bowl. In fact, no rookie  
While the Packers are set to clash with the 49ers, the Texans will have a go against the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday in the AFC Divisional Round Game, determining whether Stroud, in his rookie season, could reach a conference championship or even a Super Bowl. Thinking about it, one might wonder: Has a rookie QB ever won the Super Bowl? 
The Youngest QB To Win The Super Bowl While no rookie has claimed a Super Bowl title, a young quarterback still holds the record for the youngest to do so. Ben Roethlisberger won Super Bowl XL in  
While it was even up through the 2019 season, the last three Super Bowls saw a quarterback on a veteran contract defeating a quarterback on a rookie contract in the Super Bowl. 
No rookie quarterback has ever started in the Super Bowl. In fact, just five quarterbacks have ever gotten the starting nod during conference championship week, with Jayden Daniels set to make it six. 
Which young QBs are best set up to win a Super Bowl in 2024, 2025 or 2026? Ranking teams from 14 to 1. Pittsburgh Steelers.  Group I: When rookie quarterback contracts go wrong. 
But perhaps the biggest catalyst was the NFL introducing the rookie wage scale in 2011, which essentially bases a player’s pay rate on where they are drafted and leaves little room for negotiating. Mahomes is the most recent quarterback to win the Super Bowl while on a rookie deal. After signing his huge extension, the team has had to  
Now there’s Burrow showing up in the Super Bowl in his second season still working on his rookie contract, a bargain-basement four-year, $36 million deal. Burrow was the 19th highest paid quarterback in the league at a little more than $8 million for the 2021 season. Stafford, his Super Bowl counterpart, was paid $20 million. 
Wilson, Patrick Mahomes and Carson Wentz have won Super Bowls as their team's primary quarterback on a rookie deal since then, and nearly half of the remaining playoff field is quarterbacked by a  
Since the inception of rookie contracts as we know them today, only 2 of 11 Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks were on rookie contracts at that time. Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. 
Super Bowl 57: Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes, Eagles’ Jalen Hurts, NFL salary cap, quarterback contracts. Pete Carroll, John Schneider, Geno Smith, Seahawks watching. 
The easiest way to build a championship contender is by having a quarterback on a rookie contract. Over the last 11 Super Bowls, there hasn’t been a single Super Bowl that hasn’t included either a quarterback on a rookie contract or one of Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes. One Super Bowl had both and Mahomes was technically still on his rookie  
Super Bowl Losing QBs: 6/12 on rookie deal 1/12 5th-year option 4/12 &gt; 10% of the cap (1 in last 6 years) Does having a QB on a rookie deal allow for better roster construction? Absolutely. But you know what trumps a better roster? A franchise QB. We can quit worrying that paying Jalen Hurts closes the Super Bowl window. 
The easiest way to build a championship contender is by having a quarterback on a rookie contract. Over the last 11 Super Bowls, there hasn’t been a single Super Bowl that hasn’t included  
In the nine Super Bowls to be played since the collective bargaining agreement establishing a rookie wage scale, seven of the 18 participants in the Super Bowl have had a quarterback on his rookie

With Aaron Rodgers now eliminated from winning the Super Bowl, it means that Steve Young’s record as the highest salary cap clogging QB to win a Super Bowl remains intact. Young’s cap figure that season took up 13.1% of the 49ers salary cap. That year was 1994, the first year the salary cap was in existence. </p>
