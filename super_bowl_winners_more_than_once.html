It drives me crazy when a list like this can't even get the basics right. Super Bowl I was the 1966 Champions not 1967. New England just won the last Super Bowl for the 2018 Season. When we think if the 2 best all time defenses it's the 1985 Bears and 2000 Ravens. Their Super Bowl games were played in 1986 and 2001 respectily. George Ford (2019) 
Which team has won the most Super Bowls? There are two teams tied with the most Super Bowl wins. Both the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots have won the Super Bowl 6 times. There are two teams tied with the third most Super Bowl wins. 
With Super Bowl ticket prices routinely hitting $1,000+ today, it might be a bit shocking to know that Super Bowl I failed to sell out, with more than 30,000 empty seats at kickoff.

As mentioned, there are just five players who have won Super Bowl MVP more than once in the first 56 Super Bowls. Not surprisingly, Tom Brady has won Super Bowl MVP the most times, winning MVP honors five times while leading his team to a Super Bowl victory seven times. Brady’s first Super Bowl MVP came in Super Bowl XXXVI when he had 220  
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year.

It’s the hardest thing to do in the NFL: Once you win a Super Bowl, winning another one the very next year is nearly impossible. But it’s happened, eight times to be exact, although only once
