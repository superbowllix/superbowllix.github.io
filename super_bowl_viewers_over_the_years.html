        <h2><strong>super bowl viewers over the years nfl super bowl 2025 ot rules</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl ratings dating back to the very first game in 1967. The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. 
While the trend for average Super Bowl ratings decreased in the second half of the decade, Super Bowl LI on Fox in 2017, the first Super Bowl ever decided in overtime, currently holds the record for the largest total viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history at 172 million people. 
Beginning in 2006, the NFL broke viewership records for six-straight years, peaking at more than 111 million people watching Super Bowl XLVI. Things would remain in the 113-million range 
The average viewership number for this Super Bowl was 114,810,000. The air date for Super Bowl XLIX was on February 1, 2015. 2. Super Bowl LVII: Kansas City Chiefs vs Philadelphia Eagles. Super Bowl LVII was aired on FOX. While the Chiefs and Eagles will square off in this year’s Super Bowl, they also faced each other two years ago in the  
The NFL said that last year's Super Bowl drew in 62.5 million global viewers, which was a 10 percent increase from the year prior. Mexico and Canada combined for over 42 million viewers, but  
Last year's Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles drew 115 million viewers, the largest number since the epic New England Patriots-Seattle Seahawks slugfest in 
The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M). Men 18-24 placed second with a 20% increase (from 3.86 to 4.61 million) and girls 12-17 third with an 11% jump (from 2.63 to 2.85 million). 
The 2024 edition of the Super Bowl, which saw the Kansas City Chiefs emerge victorious against the San Francisco 49ers was watched by over 123 million viewers in the United States, making it 
How many viewers watched Super Bowl LVII? The Kansas City Chiefs’ 38-35 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, which was broadcast last Feb. 12 on Fox, had a total 
In total, year-over-year viewership was up 7.4% from 2023. “We are excited to work with the NFL, CBS, Paramount+, Nickelodeon and Univision to capture the full breadth of audience engagement for this record breaking Super Bowl,” said Nielsen CEO Karthik Rao.

NEW YORK (AP) — Eugene Levy’s trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars. A tongue dances to Shania Twain to promote Nestle’s Coffee Mate Cold Foam. And Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reunite at Katz’s Deli in an ad for Hellmann’s. A frenzied mix of silliness and celebrities is hitting the  
Aliens, sloths and silliness: Super Bowl ads offer laughs, celebs and surprises to win over viewers With a few ad spots going for a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year, the stakes have  
Over the years, I have seen Super Bowl streaming numbers misreported with numbers that have no source to them and don’t match the numbers put out each year by the broadcast networks. For example, Statista produced a chart saying streaming viewership for the 2023 Super Bowl was 21.8 million, which is inaccurate. 
Australia: Total audience reach of nearly 3 million, averaging over 1.2 million viewers — the highest since records began and up +26% year-on-year. China: Most-watched Super Bowl in the last 7  
Super Bowl LVII was also the most-streamed Super Bowl in history, per FOX, with 7 million streams, up 18% over last year's game, and the most-watched Super Bowl game in Spanish-language cable TV

This year, the Super Bowl will air on Fox. The biggest wild card for Super Bowl LIX is Tubi, a FAST service. With Tubi, consumers can watch the Super Bowl for free through the Tubi app or on Tubi.com. Will the ability to watch the Super Bowl for free entice more viewers? Super Bowl LIX kicks off on Sunday, Feb. 9, at 6:30 p.m. ET.
