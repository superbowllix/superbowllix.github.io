        <h2><strong>jesus didnt hate super bowl commercial nfl qb super bowl records</strong></h2>
        <p>One year after ads by the He Gets Us campaign ignited a social media debate, a new round of Jesus-centric Super Bowl commercials on Sunday night found believers divided once again. 
The commercial ends with the phrase, "Jesus didn't teach hate. He washed feet."  Some conservatives voiced outrage over a Christian pro-Jesus commercial that aired during the Super Bowl. 
Per the ad, it’s because “Jesus didn’t teach hate. He washed feet.” While this is technically biblically true, as depicted in the commercial, this is a far weirder ethos even than it  
Most Super Bowl adverts plug things like fizzy drink and cars, but one of the most talked-about commercials the day after the big game was selling Jesus - and it upset several very different  
It ends with these words on the screen: “Jesus didn’t teach hate, he washed feet. He gets us.”  Estimates suggest that 30 seconds of commercial time during Super Bowl LVIII cost $7  
Green discussed his involvement in the campaign, and the Super Bowl ad spots, during a November 2022 interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck. “We are wanting to say — ‘we  
‘He Gets Us’ ads on Jesus. The Super Bowl commercials from “He Gets Us” aired during the first and second quarters of Sunday’s game. Each one focused on the Bible’s call to love your neighbor, reminding viewers that “Jesus didn’t teach hate.” “Jesus washed the feet of friends and enemies. No ego or hate. He humbly loved his  
Jesus: “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.” — Matt  
As the commercial ends, words appear on the screen: “Jesus didn’t teach hate. He washed feet.”  I still don’t know how I feel about spending so much money on a Super Bowl ad about Jesus  
Super Bowl commercials are designed to provoke discussion, though most companies aim for a bit of watercooler chat about how funny, cool, or celebrity-packed their effort was. While a minute-long effort from the Servant Foundation's "He Gets Us" campaign has certainly ticked the discussion box (as it did during last year's Super Bowl spot

Jesus Christ showed up at Super Bowl LVIII – and somehow, nobody was happy about it. Here's how and why it happened, and the surprising reasons why viewers f 
A U.S. nonprofit that aired two ads during Sunday’s Super Bowl attempting to rebrand Jesus for Gen Z is also the main funder of a designated hate group opposing abortion and LGBTIQ rights, openDemocracy can reveal. 
The first commercial break of the Super Bowl featured Jesus Christ. In an ad titled “Jesus washes feet” religious company HeGetsUs.com shows various photos of regular citizens washing each others feets. Text reading “Jesus didn’t teach hate, he washed feet” then jumps up on the screen to conclude the commercial. 
This likely explains why the two Super Bowl commercials this year, valued at 20M dollars, feature a police officer washing a black man’s feet, a woman washing a pregnant woman’s feet outside of an abortion clinic, and a priest or pastor washing a gay man’s feet at the beach, with the caption reading “Jesus Didn’t Teach Hate.

Text at the very end said: “Jesus didn’t teach hate,” in all-capital letters. “He washed feet.”  PolitiFact’s verdict: No, the images from the He Gets Us Super Bowl commercial were  
“Jesus didn’t want us to act like adults,” said the ad. There were two ads: Be Childlike and Love Your Enemies. JESUS Super Bowl Commercials 2023 He Gets Us </p>
