        <p>Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
I used average viewership data from Wild Card Round, Divisional Round, Conference Championship, and Super Bowl games played between 2021 and 2025 (representing the 2020-2024 regular seasons) to  
The Super Bowl has proven to be a bigger hit with UK viewers than any Premier League football match has ever been in the US, according to recent viewing figures.. The clash between the Kansas City  
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of

The Super Bowl proved more popular with viewers in the UK than any Premier League soccer game ever has in the US as the viewing figures on both sides of the Atlantic were laid bare. The game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium proved to be one of the most watched broadcasts in American history. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
Last year's "Kelce Bowl" matchup between the Eagles and Chiefs was previously the most-watched Super Bowl ever, followed by the New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks game in 2015 (114.4  
For instance, the Premier League claimed that the division had 1.87 billion fans worldwide in May. League officials also declared that Premier League matches were available in 900 million homes in 189 countries across the globe. Regardless of statistical discrepancy within the Premier League, these impressive figures still dwarf NFL viewership. 
UEFA’s Champions League final also has a huge audience, pulling in around 400million viewers every year in late May/early June, which means it also beats the Super Bowl in terms of global  
The most recent FIFA World Cup (2018) had a viewership of 1.2 billion. How does the Super Bowl viewership compare to the Indian Premier League final? The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 season turned out to be the most-viewed IPL season ever, breaking all previous records. 
The Super Bowl may take the top spot next week, but it'll be knocked off in May when the CL final is played on a Saturday for the first time. I had to take a day off of work to watch it and I know a lot of soccer fans here in California that weren't able to watch it because of work. 
Before the Super Bowl era, the Packers won the final NFL championship in 1965 and those two Super Bowl games in 1966 and 1967. Green Bay also won the NFL championship three years in a row between

What Has More Viewers: Super Bowl or Champions League Final? Champions League final vs. Super Bowl viewership reaches into the hundreds of millions, easily, for both games! Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, which ended as a 25-22 overtime win for the Chiefs, was the most-watched telecast in US history. </p>
