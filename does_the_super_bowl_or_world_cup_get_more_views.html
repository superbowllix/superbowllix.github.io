        <p>The massive viewership numbers of the World Cup and Super Bowl pad the coffers of FIFA and the NFL respectively. FIFA has turned a profit of nearly $5 billion or more from the last three World Cups. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
The FIFA World Cup Final in 2018, which featured young phenom Kylian Mbappe and France defeating Croatia by a thrilling score of 4-2, had 3.57 billion viewers, per FIFA. For comparison, the 2022  
The Super Bowl isn’t going to become the most-watched sporting event on Earth, and the FIFA World Cup — nor anything else — is likely going to oust the NFL title game from its domestic throne. 
Does the Super Bowl generate more money than the World Cup? According to FIFA , the 2022 Qatar tournament generated $6.314 million in rights sales and $929 million in hospitality and ticketing. Al Jazeera revealed that the 2022 Qatar Tournament brought $7.5 billion in revenue, $1 billion more than the 2018 tournament held in Russia. 
This is because even by FOX’s assumptions, Super Bowl LVII could have fetched around 114.5 million views. The actual Super Bowl viewership numbers will come out in a couple of days but even if we go by the most optimistic assumptions, there is still a lot of catching up to do for NFL as far as attracting global viewership is concerned. 
When it comes to the most viewed, then the men's FIFA World Cup Final trumps them all. According to Roadtrips.com five billion people watch the World Cup Final, while the Super Bowl is actually the 8th most-watched event with 115 million views. Finishing above NFL's showpiece are the Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, Women's World Cup, Olympic  
How does attendance data compare in the World Cup vs. Super Bowl? SoFi Stadium’s capacity is over 70,000, which adds up to the sold-out Super Bowl LVI attendance of 70,240 . Qatar is expected to have 3 million fans across the world come into the country to attend live matches, which is just shy of the 3.1 million fans in the 2018 World Cup in

Finishing above NFL's showpiece are the Tour de France, Cricket World Cup, Women's World Cup, Olympic Games, Winter Games and the Champions League Final. 
The 2018 FIFA World Cup final polled a viewership of 1.12 billion viewers while the highest grossing NFL Super Bowl grossed 114 million viewers, more than ten times its size. The 2021 Super Bowl had a revenue of $545m while 2018 FIFA World Cup had a revenue of $5.36 billion. 
The official Super bowl vs World Cup view totals are in, and they may surprise some of you Futbol does indeed still beat football, but not by as much as FIF

More people watch Europe's version of the Super Bowl than the actual Super Bowl - about 350 million at last count, depending on the participants (and the sporadic, year-long tournament obviously brings in more viewers than that).There's no good way to compare one 90-minute game to a 17-day event but that's why arbitrary lists exist. 
More people tune into the World Cup Final than the Super Bowl, simply because soccer is a worldwide sport. However, FIFA's claim that more than 1 billion people tune into the World Cup final is exaggerated.According to a 2007 article in the UK newspaper The Independent, "Fifa's overblown figures, the World Cup finals of 1998, 2002 and 2006 respectively attracted global audiences of 1.3 billion  
I think it is because the two teams that play in the Super Bowl are the "National Football Conference Champions" and the "American Football Conference Champions", so then saying "National Champions" for the Super Bowl might be confusing. I haven't really seen "World Champions" much anyway, "Super Bowl Champs" is much more common. 
Unfortunately, Sports Media Watch hasn’t released data on 2019’s Super Bowl, but when it does, we will update this story comparing 2018’s Worlds to 2019’s Super Bowl. Dot Esports is  </p>
