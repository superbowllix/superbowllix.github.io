        <p>The 2025 Super Bowl logo was revealed in February 2024, and coincidentally, the colors are primarily red and green, which appropriately represent the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles  
The Super Bowl 59 logo follows the same pattern, but it also marks the first time the NFL has collaborated with an artist local to the championship city to craft the Big Game's logo.

The 2025 Super Bowl logo reflects the character of New Orleans, chosen as the match’s host city. The design conveys the city’s festive atmosphere, known for its lively festivals and unique Mardi Gras Indian traditions. Additionally, the emblem highlights the dynamism of the sporting event that unites football fans worldwide.
