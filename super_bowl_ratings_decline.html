        <h2><strong>super bowl ratings decline super bowl food to buy</strong></h2>
        <p>With Super Bowl LIX, days away, NFL ratings have overall dropped compared to last season. This decline includes the regular season and all three rounds of the postseason leading up to Super Sunday. 
The sharp decline of in-home viewership tracks with the trend in household ratings (which by definition do not include out-of-home viewing). The Super Bowl averaged a 36.9 rating last year and a 38.6 two years ago, the two lowest ratings for the game since 1969. 
[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets  
The Super Bowl isn't the event it once was. 
According to an article from CNBC, the Super Bowl ratings for viewers aged 18 to 49 have decreased every year for the past 10 years - from 52.2 million in 2011 to 34.3 million in 2021. While the decline in viewership could be partially attributed to the rise of streaming, as 5.7 million people streamed the Super Bowl in 2021, the streaming  
The 9 percent decline in television viewership from last year’s Super Bowl is roughly in line with season-long trends. N.F.L. games this season were watched by 7 percent fewer people than the  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
This game and Super Bowl LIII (Patriots over Rams, 98.48 million) were the only games since 2009 not to crack nine-figure TV viewership marks. This decline was obvious from the early returns. 
Last year’s Super Bowl, in which the Chiefs topped the 49ers 31-20, amassed 102 million viewers across Fox, Fox Deportes and all digital properties, with viewership on Fox alone totaling 99.9  
The pace of the NFL's ratings growth over the past few years won't last forever. In part, the league's recent successes have just been making up for a downturn during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018  
2025 Super Bowl Viewership Prediction Method. I decided to use a very simple method to predict the viewership numbers for the upcoming Super Bowl: the tried-and-true linear regression. 
The lowest scoring Super Bowl in history tied a 16-year ratings low. Sunday’s Patriots-Rams Super Bowl 53 earned a 41.1 rating and 98.2 million viewers on CBS, down 5% in ratings and viewership from Eagles-Patriots on NBC last year (43.1, 103.4M) and down 9% and 12% respectively from Patriots-Falcons on FOX in 2017 (45.3, 11.3M). 
Taking place in the middle of a global pandemic Super Bowl LV was an NFL championship game unlike any other. But the big game still brought in another Super Bowl victory for Tom Brady and a  
Every year, the story of the Super Bowl is partly a story of its gargantuan audience. Of the 20 most-watched TV broadcasts in U.S. history, 19 are Super Bowls.(The other one is the series finale  
After a decline in 2021, NFL fans came out in droves to watch Super Bowl LVI. The program resulted in 112.3 million viewers in 2022, according to NBC Sports.. The game — which featured the Los  
(Nielsen began including out-of-home viewing in their ratings service in September 2020. Sports Media Watch said, unofficially, the 2017 Super Bowl overtime game Patriots-Falcons had averaged 124.  
After a twenty-four-hour delay, the ratings are in for Sunday night’s Super Bowl LV, in which the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9, giving quarterback Tom Brady his  
Super Bowl 56 Ratings Soar to 112.3 Million After Last Year’s Decline A 16% increase over 2021's game on CBS The audience included 99.2 million on NBC, 1.9 million on Telemundo and 11.2 million  
The Super Bowl drew 100.7m viewers across traditional TV channels and streaming platforms — a decline from recent years for the most-watched live television event in the US sporting calender. 
The Super Bowl on Sunday drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers who watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in a nail-biting overtime triumph, CBS Sports said in a  </p>
