        <h2><strong>joe gibbs super bowl qb miaa super bowl results</strong></h2>
        <p>Joseph Jackson Gibbs (born November 25, 1940) is an American auto racing team owner and former football coach. He served as the head coach of the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) from 1981 to 1992 and then 2004 to 2007, leading them to nine playoff appearances, five NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowl wins over 16 seasons. 
The second triumph in an NFL championship game followed in January 1988 with a rout of the Denver Broncos, and Gibbs scored his hat trick in Super Bowl 26 by downing the Buffalo Bills. What made the three Super Bowl triumphs unique is that they came in just a 10-year span, but with three different quarterbacks at the helm: Joe Theismann , Jay  
Joe Gibbs is different from these great coaches in that he didn’t have a marquee quarterback. He won three Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks. Only Bill Parcells has ever won even two  
Gibbs’ only championship-game losses came at the hands of the Los Angeles Raiders in Super Bowl XVIII and the New York Giants in the 1986 NFC title contest. In 12 years, the Gibbs-led Redskins compiled a 124-60-0 regular-season record and a 16-5 record in 21 postseason games. 
It was during Gibbs’ “first term”, his 12-year run as head coach from 1981-92. That run produced four trips to the Super Bowl and three Lombardi Trophies. Even more impressively, Gibbs won his Super Bowls with a different starting quarterback each time. Glory Years recaptures that 12-year run in all of its detail. Each individual season

Most coaches find one winning QB and stick with them. Gibb won Super Bowl XVIII with Joe Theismann, Super Bowl XXII with Doug Williams, and Super Bowl XXVi with Mark Rypien.

Williams was the first black quarterback to win a Super Bowl. He was named the game’s Most Valuable Player. Williams, now 62, and Gibbs, 77, will sit down Sunday on NBC before this year’s  
Most notably, Gibbs generated his Super Bowl triumphs using a succession of different quarterbacks, beginning with Joe Theismann in 1982, Doug Williams in 1988, and Mark Rypien in 1992. In the heyday of his winning leadership, Gibbs stunned the sporting public on 5 March 1993 by announcing his resignation as head coach of the Washington Redskins. 
Joe Gibbs won 3 Super Bowls with 3 Different Quarterbacks- none of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In 1982 it was Joe Theismann at QB, in 1987 it was Doug Williams., and in 1991 it was Mark Rypien. I saw this on the Ask Vic article on Packers.com, and it's pretty impressive. 
Gibbs was named the 1982 and 1983 NFL Coach of the Year and is the only head coach to have won Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks.He and his sons founded the NASCAR team Joe Gibbs Racing in 1992, which has since won five NASCAR championships.
