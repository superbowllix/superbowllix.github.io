        <h2><strong>super bowl xlii reddit who won super bowl xl vii</strong></h2>
        <p>Before kickoff Super Bowl XLII (2007 Patriots vs Giants), Giants backup QB Jared Lorenzen went and checked the Giants' Gatorade color. He then texted his friend who had financial difficulties and told him the color so that friend could gamble on the Prop Bet and make money if the Giants won. 
Super Bowl they were 12.5 point underdogs. The entire game was filled with incredible tension. Not a single person watching didn’t care who won. The helmet catch was bonkers in real time. I just can’t imagine anyone who lived through it would have this opinion about Super Bowl XLII. 
Tom Brady won me money in the Eagles pats super bowl. Being a 3rd grader and winning 125 will make you love anyone lmao. Then he helped win me a fantasy league a few years back. 
On February 3, 2008, the Giants faced their most daunting task ever in Super Bowl XLII: taking on the 18-0 New England Patriots. Not only were the Patriots looking to become just the second team  
In doing so, the Patriots became the first team ever to go 18-0 in a season. The New York Giants spoiled New England’s place in history with a narrow win in Super Bowl XLII. Despite the loss, the Patriots joined an elite group of teams that have posted undefeated regular season records. 
The New York Giants: Road to Super Bowl XLII was released on June 3, 2008. It was a 5 disc set that featured the full broadcasts of the last game of the regular season and all four playoff games. On August 26, 2009 New York Giants 10 Greatest Games was released, in which Super Bowl XLII was included as well.

GLENDALE, Ariz. – The imperfect team picked the perfect time to deny perfection. There was 2:39 remaining last night in Super Bowl XLII and the Giants had fought the good fight, the gallant f 
Given that today is 18-1 day, I rewatched these Super Bowl highlights, and noticed something crazy. The patriots failed to convert on 4th and 20 and there was 2 seconds left of the clock. Coughlin gets his Gatorade bath and players start to celebrate, but the Giants offense still needs to run a kneel down. 
This Sunday the 12th Super Bowl XLII will be re-aired at 3:00 pm est, 12:00 noon PST.  Not on reddit. This game is so old it happened 222 days BEFORE r/nfl even  
The season is closing and we're in for a pretty great matchup. I hope you were all able to do well in your predictions this year and come out over .500. For the Championship games, I went 0-2, bringing me to 8-4. I've heard this matchup being called the Reid Bowl, or the Kelce Bowl. I'm just hoping for a great game. Here we go!

SUPER BOWL 42 Re-Watch, April 12th, 2020. The broadcast will have real-time analysis of the game, provided by the players who were on the field, there will be a live post-game Q&amp;A on Twitter and the Giants will run a giveaway featuring a David Tyree signed football. 
Nothing will ever stand up to that Super Bowl run for me. Picked to lose every week. Eli, no gloves, vs Mr. Cold Weather Favre bundled up for the sub zero temps. Capped off with the 18 and uh oh Super Bowl stomping those arrogant fuckers out.
