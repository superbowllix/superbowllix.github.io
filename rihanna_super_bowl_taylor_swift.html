Speculation abounded about Taylor Swift earlier this week, after Variety reported three sources allegedly close to the singer confirmed she would be performing at the Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show.

According to an anonymous insider source who allegedly spoke with TMZ, Swift was indeed offered the Super Bowl performance opportunity but turned it down.As for why the Grammy winner said ‘no’ to the idea, she reportedly wants to focus on re-recording the rest of her albums— her 2006 self-titled record, 2010’s Speak Now, 2014’s 1989 and 2017’s Reputation— as she already released

Also Taylor has shown how versatile she is with her recent albums, she’s being able to cross into multiple different genres.
