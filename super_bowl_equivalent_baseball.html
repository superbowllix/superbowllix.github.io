The Cubs are the first Major League Baseball team to come back from a 3–1 series deficit to win the World Series since the 1985 Royals and the first since the 1979 Pirates to do so by winning Games 6 &amp; 7 on the road.

If we’d won the Super Bowl in 2019, Shanahan would’ve almost perfectly replicated Bill Walsh’s first three years. Walsh went 4-12 in 1979, 6-10 in 1980, and 13-3 in 1981. Shanahan went 6-10 in 2017, 4-12 in 2018, and 13-3 in 2019.
