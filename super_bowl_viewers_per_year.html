        <h2><strong>super bowl viewers per year what day is the super bowl in 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people.

The Super Bowl proved to be a record-breaking culmination of an already historically impressive year for NFL games—matchups during the 2023 regular season drew an average of 17.9 million viewers  
Over the years, I have seen Super Bowl streaming numbers misreported with numbers that have no source to them and don’t match the numbers put out each year by the broadcast networks.

NFL recorded an international viewership of 62.5 million in 2023 for the Super Bowl. This figure excluded the domestic viewership of 123.4 million viewers in the United States.
