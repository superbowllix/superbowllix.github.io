A record 62.5 million viewers outside of the U.S. watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers in last month's Super Bowl, confirming on Wednesday that the National Football League  
In the United States, a custom survey from Nielsen and the NFL revealed that Super Bowl LVIII reached approximately 210 million viewers – nearly 2/3 of Americans – across CBS Television  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
According to the NFL’s viewership numbers, global (non-US) viewership of the Super Bowl increased an impressive 10 percent for the 2024 game, compared to the previous year. This is reflected in some of the league’s largest markets below, which all drew more Super Bowl viewers.

The NFL said Wednesday that more than 62 million people outside the U.S. watched this year’s Super Bowl, a 10% increase from 2023. 
American football’s NFL has announced an international total viewership of 62.5 million people for the 2023 edition of its showpiece season finale, the Super Bowl. The figure, which excludes the league’s record domestic viewership of 123.4 million viewers in the US, is a 10% increase on the 2023 edition of the game. 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four

With Super Bowl LVI just around the corner and lots of buzz around this year's Super Bowl commercials, many non-American viewers might be wondering exactly how they can view them outside the US. The commercial breaks during the Super Bowl are every year's most sought-after advertising slots due to the sheer size of the Super Bowl's audience

LONDON (AP) — The NFL’s aggressive international growth plan could include holding a Super Bowl outside the United States for the first time, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Saturday. Goodell has shot down the idea in the past, but he told a fan forum in London that it’s a possibility.
