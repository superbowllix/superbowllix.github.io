Experts didn't give the New York Jets much of a chance of winning Super Bowl III in 1969, but Joe Namath and the rest of the Jets players proved them wrong. 
In 1969, New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath became famous for his prediction that the Jets would beat the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, which they did, 16-7 But Joe Namath the celebrity also became a key figure in changing the allure of pro football, making it more exciting &amp; telegenic, more appealing to fans &amp; advertisers, and  
Joe Nameth “Guaranteed” Super Bowl III Victory. The video by Peyton Manning’s production house took everyone back to the Super Bowl III game which took place on 12th January 1969. That particular game changed the NFL landscape altogether. However, even Peyton noticed that in the end, the game was largely about just one man – Joe Namath.
