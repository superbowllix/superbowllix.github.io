        <p>The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. [1] 
The trophy everyone dreams of hoisting at the end of the Super Bowl carries a name that wasn’t always its own. Discover the story behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, a tribute to a legendary coach. 
The Lombardi Trophy is awarded annually to the winner of the Super Bowl, crowning that team as the NFL champion. It was first presented to the Green Bay Packers on Jan. 15, 1967, at the conclusion  
Before the game was even called the Super Bowl, it was known as the AFL-NFL Championship. It was only four years later the NFL changed the name of the trophy. In 1970, the league decided to change the name of the award from “World Championship Game Trophy” to the “Vince Lombardi Trophy” after his passing. 
The NFL casts a new trophy every year to award to the Super Bowl champion. The Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots have the most Lombardi Trophies with six. The 49ers can claim their  
The Vince Lombardi Trophy is 22 inches tall, weighs seven pounds and was designed on a napkin in 1966 for the 1967 Super Bowl by Oscar Riedner, the vice president of design at Tiffany &amp; Co. The  
The Super Bowl trophy is named after Vince Lombardi, the legendary coach of the Green Bay Packers who won the first two Super Bowls. Learn how the trophy was created, what it looks like and how it is presented to the winning team. 
The pinnacle of professional football is the Vince Lombardi Trophy, awarded each season to the Super Bowl champion. But how did the Super Bowl trophy name, the Lombardi Trophy, come to represent excellence in the NFL? The Lombardi football trophy is named in honor of Vince Lombardi after losing his battle with cancer in late 1970 at the age of 57. 
The base of the trophy is designed to accommodate the names of the winning team, the Super Bowl number, and the game’s date. As a result, the trophy serves as a tangible record of NFL history, showcasing the teams that have achieved greatness on the grandest stage. 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy has been the highest accolade in the football stratosphere for the past 57 years, since the Super Bowl was born in 1967. The trophy is named after the one and only Vince  
The first team to hoist the newly-named Lombardi Trophy was the Baltimore Colts, who defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V in 1971. The trophy stands 22 inches tall and is made from seven  
While the Super Bowl trophy has been named after Lombardi, the AFC Championship trophy has been named in Hunt's honor. Fittingly, Hunt's team, the Chiefs, will vie to become the first team to win  
Here’s how Tiffany &amp; Co. came to create the first-ever Super Bowl Trophy for the NFL in 1966, plus how it’s made year after year. 
Where did the name Vince Lombardi Trophy come from? Although the essence of football has been practiced in the United States since 1869, the first Super Bowl trophy was awarded almost 100 years  
But Belichick, who became head coach at North Carolina in December, suggested naming the trophy after Tom Brady, who won an NFL-record seven Super Bowl rings in his career. 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy, the iconic symbol of triumph in American football, has become synonymous with the Super Bowl, the pinnacle of the NFL season. But have you ever wondered 
Super Bowl Trophy wasn’t always the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Super Bowl trophy wasn’t always known as the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Originally, it was called the World Professional Football Championship Trophy. This name was used for the first few Super Bowls before it was changed in honor of Vince Lombardi after his untimely death in 1970. 
Currently, the trophy is named for the Green Bay Packers head coach whose teams won the first two Super Bowls. To many, that trophy name seems as embedded in league lore as the NHL’s Stanley Cup. Belichick now coaches the University of North Carolina Tar Heels, but Brady led the Pats to six Super Bowl victories with Belichick as head coach. 
A new trophy has been crafted every year since Super Bowl I, made entirely of gleaming silver over the course of a painstaking four-month process at Tiffany’s workshop in Cumberland, Rhode Island. </p>
