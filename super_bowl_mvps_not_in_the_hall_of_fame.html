Bud Abell didn't win the Super Bowl MVP award in Super Bowls in his rookie season in Super Bowl I versus the Packers on January 15, 1967. how many super bowl mvps did not make hall of fame Bud Abell didn't win the Super Bowl MVP award in Super Bowls in his rookie season in Super Bowl I versus the Packers on January 15, 1967. 
Only 13 players who have won the Super Bowl MVP have not made it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Forty-eight players have been named the Super Bowl MVP at least once. Out of the 37 retired  
Rich Gannon may have never won a Super Bowl but he was named NFL MVP in 2002.  For a NFL player, being inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio is the greatest honor 
Now, let’s not feel sorry for Julian Edelman when he doesn’t make the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He still has those three Super Bowl rings and that Super Bowl MVP trophy and made more than $44 million during his career with the Patriots. And it’s not as if he’ll be the only Super Bowl MVP not to get the call to Canton. 
Super Bowl LIII marked the only other time Tom Brady wasn’t named the MVP of a Super Bowl he won, as that honor went to Julian Edelman. New England’s 13-3 win over the Rams is widely regarded as one of the dullest Super Bowls ever played, and Edelman’s performance on a night where he tallied 10 passes for 141 yards is really the only

Eli Manning’s two Super Bowl runs weren’t enough to get him into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on the first try. The 2025 Canton class includes Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jared Allen  
Eli Manning was not selected to the 2025 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. He is a two-time Super Bowl MVP and 16-year NFL veteran. 
Eli Manning's inclusion in the Pro Football Hall of Fame will have to wait at least another year. The New York Giants' legendary quarterback and two-time Super Bowl MVP did not make the final cut  
The Hall of Fame class of 2025 was announced at the NFL Honors Thursday night, which will send four football legends to be enshrined forever in Canton. Not amongst the inductees, however, was the most famous of the 15 modern-day finalists: New York Giants QB Eli Manning. 
Other Super Bowl MVPs are not in the Hall of Fame. Winning a Super Bowl MVP award does not guarantee you a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Just ask Jim Plunkett, Phil Simms, Doug Williams  
NFL Honors and 2025 Hall of Fame Class The annual event on the Thursday before the Super Bowl took place in New Orleans. NFL Honors saw all sorts of great players, celebrities and entertainers in  
imagine a qb who has 2 super bowl wins, 2 super bowl mvps, is 11th all time in passing yards and passing tds and yet hes not a 1st ballot hall of famer. eli manning remains the most underrated and  
Plunkett holds the distinction of being the only retired quarterback who won two Super Bowl MVPs but is not enshrined in Canton. Curse of the dreaded "game manager" moniker. 
For Eli: He won two Super Bowl MVPs. His brother, while also a winner of two Super Bowls, only won MVP once. For Eli: The list of quarterbacks in NFL history who won at least two Super Bowl MVP  
Accolades: Two-time Super Bowl champion, Super Bowl MVP, and two-time Pro Bowl selection Phil Simms gained a lot of early criticism despite playing with inferior talent for the New York Giants. By 1985, Simms grew into a Pro Bowl talent, and in the next season, he led the Giants to their first Super Bowl victory. 
Manning’s case was always a polarizing one—two Super Bowl MVPs, legendary playoff performances, and undeniable clutch moments versus a .500 career record and a lack of individual accolades. 
The fact is he has two Super Bowl MVPs, the history and longevity. No one - even us who love Eli more than anything - would argue he was the top QB in the league or should have been MVP. But Hall of Fame is different. He's for sure that. You don't do what he did in 2007 and 2011 and not make it. 
That’s not a simple question for the Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee, which has to decide if the two-time Super Bowl MVP is worthy of first-time entry into Canton. </p>
