        <p>The Jets' most recent championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002  
How many times have the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl? The Dallas Cowboys have won a total of 5 Super Bowls, in 1971, 1977, 1992-1993 and 1995. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in Dallas.

Super Bowl 30: Dallas Cowboys 27, Pittsburgh Steelers 17 Super Bowl 31: Green Bay Packers 35, New England Patriots 21 Super Bowl 32: Denver Broncos 31, Green Bay Packers 24 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
Another Super Bowl followed six years later before the Cowboys' dominance faded in 1982, and so started a nine-year stretch in which Dallas only reached the post-season twice. But as the 1980s came to an end, life under new owner Jerry Jones was about to begin, and under head coaches Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer, the Cowboys were crowned  
The Dallas Cowboys are a team with a rich Super Bowl history. With five Super Bowl wins, the team has the second-most Super Bowl wins in the history of the NFL. The Cowboys have made it to eight  
Dallas Cowboys All-Time Super Bowl Record The Cowboys are one of the winningest teams in NFL history, owning a 5-3 all-time record in the Super Bowl. They've won the title in each of their past three SB appearances, rattling off wins in 1992, 1993 and 1995. 
Dallas returned to the Super Bowl, following the 1978 season, losing to Pittsburgh 35–31. Bob Ryan, an NFL Films editor, dubbed the Cowboys "America's Team" following the Super Bowl loss, a nickname that has earned derision from non-Cowboys fans but has stuck through both good times and bad. [30] 
The New York Giants upset a Patriots team that was favored by 12.5-points in Super Bowl XLII, preventing New England from becoming the second team in history to finish undefeated. 
Fans of Texas NFL teams tend to consume the most calories and are the biggest pregamers in the country on Super Bowl Sunday, a recent survey reveals.  Dallas Cowboys: 3,442 calories; Chicago  
Owner/President/General Manager: Jerry Jones (Owner serves as team's de facto General Manager) Head Coach/Player Personnel: Jimmy Johnson. Defensive Alignment: 4-3. Preseason Odds: Super Bowl +1000; O/U: 9.5. Training Camp: St. Edward's University (Austin, Texas) More Team Info 
While the Cowboys won't be participating, they're tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the most Super Bowls in NFL history with five, capping off back-to-back Lombardi trophies in 1993 by defeating the Buffalo Bills 30-13 in Super Bowl XXVIII. 
MGM's John Ewing joins Bet the Edge to tell Croucher and Dinsick about some popular prop bets for Super Bowl LIX, including Dallas Goedert's receiving yards over and a clever touchdown play. 
Super Bowl LIX is gearing up to be a huge game.But Dallas Cowboys fans will probably be upset at the obvious: The division rival Philadelphia Eagles will be playing on their third Super Bowl since the 2017 NFL season, while America's Team has yet to make even an NFC Conference Championship Game since 1996. 
Owner/President/General Manager: Jerry Jones (Owner serves as team's de facto General Manager) Head Coach/Player Personnel: Jimmy Johnson. Defensive Alignment: 4-3. Preseason Odds: Super Bowl +350; O/U: 11.5. Training Camp: St. Edward's University (Austin, Texas) More Team Info

The 1995 team lands right in the middle of Dallas’ five Super Bowl-winning squads, as this unit was great but not quite as dominant as the top two. 4 1971 The Cowboys' first championship team  
Two teams have won five Super Bowls, the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers. The Green Bay Packers, Kansas City Chiefs and New York Giants each have four.  The team’s first Super Bowl  
Dallas was the only NFC team to win the Super Bowl during the 1970s (although both Baltimore and Pittsburgh were pre-merger NFL teams). Both Cowboy victories in the decade came in New Orleans against teams making their first Super Bowl appearance. This was the first Super Bowl between two teams who had met in regular season play. </p>
