        <h2><strong>super bowl tv tropes katy perry super bowl budget</strong></h2>
        <p>The Big Game of American Football.. In all of North American sports, there's no single event quite like the Super Bowl. Occurring in late January or (since 2004) early February every year, the Super Bowl is the championship game of the National Football League, pitting the champion of the American Football Conference (AFC) against the champion of the National Football Conference (NFC). 
The Super Bowl XLV commercial for the Chrysler 200 was seen as a positive moment for Detroit, Eminem, and Chrysler. Super Bowl XLV also had the Volkswagen Passat ad where a kid dressed as Darth Vader tries using "The Force" on everything and failing until his dad helps him with Forcing the car to start.

Amazon’s Super Bowl LII commercial takes a comedic approach to the idea of technological glitches by imagining a world where Alexa, the virtual assistant, loses her voice. The ad features a star-studded lineup of celebrities, including Rebel Wilson, Gordon Ramsay, and Cardi B, stepping in as replacements for Alexa with humorous results. 
This remains the best market share of any Super Bowl and potentially any TV broadcast outside of a massive news event, even though its total ratings (i.e. the percentage of all households watching the game) were pretty average by Super Bowl standards, indicating that there really wasn't much else on. Regardless, this game had the biggest  
This quote eerily applies to the Super Bowl’s massive viewership. With over 100 million viewers annually, the game’s significance lies in its perception. Players’ performances, controversial calls, and even commercials gain importance because they’re widely observed, embodying Berkeley’s idealist philosophy in a modern, sports-centric

Ranked the 31st best Super Bowl by NFL Throwback in 2022. First (and only) Super Bowl in which the same two teams met in consecutive years. Ironically, due to the reshuffling of the network rotation a few years prior, this was also the only time the same broadcast duo covered the Super Bowl in consecutive years (These were also the only Super Bowls with Bob Trumpy in the booth, who had been

Super-Hero-Bowl! Super-Villain-Bowl! The face-off between three Dark Lords in "Villain Bowl". Just the mental idea of Sauron being married is hysterical in of itself. Pennywise taunts Davy Jones by taking the form of his worst fear: A sushi chef  
This Is Us is a dramedy series aired by NBC that started in 2016 and ended in 2022 after six seasons. Created by Dan Fogelman (best known for Crazy, Stupid, Love and Tangled), it tells the story of four characters all turning thirty-six years old  
In "Super-Villain-Bowl!", we have a scene where Darth Vader battles The Alien Queen, what more needs to be said. At the end of "Villain-Bowl" Thanos and Jean Grey as Phoenix are seemingly the only ones left. Thanos uses the Time Stone to revert Jean to her younger self when she was less powerful.
