        <p>The Chiefs can become the first team in NFL history to win the Super Bowl in three consecutive seasons. Kansas City beat Philadelphia 38-35 in Super Bowl 57 and beat San Francisco 25-22 in Super  
Has any NFL team won 3 Super Bowls in a row? The Kansas City Chiefs are back-to-back Super Bowl champions. The Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers in overtime in Super Bowl 58 to win 
Although no franchise to date has won three Super Bowls in a row, several have had eras of sustained success, nearly accomplishing a three-peat: The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. 
Only three teams in NFL history have reached the Super Bowl three straight times, and all of them hail from the AFC East. Interestingly, no NFC team has ever accomplished this feat. Here’s a closer 
The Chiefs will meet the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans with a chance to become the first team in NFL history to capture three straight Lombardi Trophies. 
There has never been a team that won three straight titles in the Super Bowl era. Several teams won three or more consecutive NFL Championships, but those took place before the Packers and Chiefs squared off in January 1967. 
New England won a tight battle over the Panthers in Super Bowl 38 to claim the franchise's second championship, and the Patriots would narrowly defeat the Eagles in Super Bowl 39 to become 
The Chiefs are attempting to become the first team to win three Super Bowls in a row after defeating the Eagles in 2023 and the 49ers last year. So any Chiefs player on the roster for a third  
In the Super Bowl era, the Patriots and Cowboys came closest to winning three straight. New England won three titles in four years between the 2001 and 2004 seasons. Meanwhile, the Cowboys won three Super Bowl titles in four years between the 1992 and 1995 seasons. 
No NFL team has ever won three consecutive Super Bowls. In fact, no team in NFL history has even reached the Super Bowl stage after winning two championships in a row. 
Yet, not even Brady and Belichick could win three straight championships despite being among the teams to reach the Super Bowl three years in a row. What Made The Patriots Great The combination of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady made the Patriots one of the league’s premiere franchises. 
The New England Patriots last won the Super Bowl in the 2018 season.  twice in a row in the 2003-2004 seasons. All National Football League Teams  
The Miami Dolphins were the first team to reach three straight Super Bowls. Miami was the runner-up in the 1971 season before winning two straight Super Bowls. The New England Patriots had been  
Both of Dallas’ wins were relatively comfortable, as three fourth-quarter touchdowns secured a 52-17 drubbing over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII and 24 unanswered second-half points led them to a 30-13 win in the rematch a year later. 
The Green Bay Packers previously won three championships in a row from 1965-67, but the first was an NFL championship before they won the first two AFL-NFL world championships. 
Are Chiefs Chasing History With 3 Super Bowls in a Row? Since the Super Bowl became a thing in 1967, only eight teams have managed to win it in consecutive years: the Kansas City Chiefs (2023-2024  
It counts as only back-to-back Super Bowl wins, but it was indeed three straight titles. Heck, the first title — a 23-12 victory — even came against a future AFC team in Cleveland. 
That's right: Since the first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, there has been exactly ONE player who has managed to win three Super Bowls in a row, and that player is Ken Norton Jr. 
A win by the Chiefs would give the franchise a fourth Super Bowl championship in six years, including three in a row. 
Teams that reached 3 Super Bowls in row had one thing in common: Lots of Hall of Famers  1967 &gt; SUPER BOWL WIN. Green Bay 35, Kansas City 10. 1968 &gt; SUPER BOWL WIN. Green Bay 33, Oakland 14  </p>
