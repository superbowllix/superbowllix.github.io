        <p>Super Bowl XLV is the 8th Super Bowl appearance for the Steelers and the 5th for the Packers. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey (ankle) and defensive end Aaron Smith (triceps) will not play, cornerback Bryant McFadden is healthy enough to start. Packers receiver Donald Driver (quad) questionable. 
Ya there were some big plays like the Nick Collins pick-6, Clay forcing that fumble on Mendenhall, the much maligned Jarrett Bush's game sealing pick, the Jennings TD where he got lit up by Polamalu and the Jennings 3rd down conversion with that great throw from Rodgers were the main ones I remember. 
Super Bowl XLV. Noteables: Date: 2/6/11 Stadium: Cowboys Stadium, Arlington TX Attendance: 103,219 National Anthem: Christina Aguilera Halftime Show: Black Eyed Peas  
Super Bowl XLV is no exception. I'll even take it one step further. When all factors are added together, this won't only be the biggest NFL championship game ever played on Feb. 6 (6:30 p.m  
Re: Superbowl XLV I'm indifferent on who I'm rooting for, though I will probably end up rooting for the Steelers, since I like Roethlisraper, and I think he's unfairly gotten a bad rap. But with that said, just looking at it, and going with my gut feeling, I think the Steelers will win. They just know how to win Super Bowls. 
Recapping the winners and losers of Super Bowl XLV finds Aaron Rodgers and Ted Thompson on the right side of the ledger, while Ben Roethlisberger and the NFL take their lumps. 
They were 10-6 and a wild card, but they came into Super Bowl XLV as three-point favorites over the Steelers. Rodgers threw for 3,922 yards and 28 touchdowns, with 11 interceptions, a high number for him. 
However, Super Bowl XLV was the first Super Bowl game to break the 100,000 threshold in attendance since Super Bowl XXI in 1987. Due to numerous delays, including damage sustained from an ice storm, 1,250 temporary seats weren't ready in time for the game. 
Super Bowl XLV is the 8th Super Bowl appearance for the Steelers and the 5th for the Packers. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey (ankle) and defensive end Aaron Smith (triceps) will not play, cornerback Bryant McFadden is healthy enough to start. Packers receiver Donald Driver (quad) questionable.

As an Eagles fan, I remember anticipating Super Bowl 39 and I really loved that game's logo (not so much the game itself lol still hurts). After Super Bowl 44, The NFL decided to go into more of a unified and corporate identity for the big game which is kind of disappointing now.

10 Years ago today: The Ravens defeat the 49ers 34-31 in Super Bowl XLVII Yes, it's been a full decade, February 3, 2013, since the Baltimore Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in SB XLVII, nicknamed the "Har-Bowl" because of the brothers coaching each team or the "Blackout Bowl" for the half hour delay in the middle of the game  
Counting Super Bowl 46 the next year, this meant a 5 year period during which every quarterback that played in the Super Bowl would/is expected to go to the Hall, the longest such streak. The next closest is 4 straight from Super Bowls 8 to 11, featuring Terry Bradshaw (x2), Fran Tarkenton (x3), Roger Staubach, Bob Griese, and Ken Stabler  
I just bought the DVD that has all their Playoff Games from that run and the Super Bowl. Haven't watched it yet though. Bought the BluRay seasons highlight from that year and watched that.
