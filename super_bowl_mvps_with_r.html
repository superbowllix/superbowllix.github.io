The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game.

The MPV award is given to the most valuable player in the Super Bowl final. The award is currently decided by a fan vote during the game (20%) and by a panel of 16 American football writers and broadcasters who vote after the game (80%). Quarterbacks have won the award more than 50% of the time. See more Super Bowl MVP Trivia. 
Mahomes enters Super Bowl 59 tied with Joe Montana for the second-most Super Bowl MVPs at three apiece. The only other players to win the award multiple times are Terry Bradshaw (2), Eli Manning

The Super Bowl MVP voting system is a bit complex. The MVP is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel’s ballots count for 80% of the vote tally, while the viewers’ ballots make up the other 20%. 
Super Bowl Most Valuable Players: NO. PLAYER: HIGHLIGHTS: I: Bart Starr, QB, Green Bay: Two touchdown passes: II: Bart Starr, QB, Green Bay: 202 yards passing, 1 TD 
There have been a total of 57 Super Bowl MVPs handed out in the history of the NFL, yet only 48 players have actually received a Most Valuable Player trophy given out after the league championship game takes place. Here is the Complete list of NFL players to ever win Super Bowl MVP honor from SB I to LVII ( 1967-2024). 
Here is a complete list of Super Bowl MVPs, from I to LVI: Super Bowl I — QB Bart Starr, Green Bay; Super Bowl II — QB Bart Starr, Green Bay; Super Bowl III — QB Joe Namath, N.Y. Jets; Super  
Over the course of 57 Super Bowls, a defensive player has won the MVP award only 10 times. Here's a list of every Super Bowl MVP. 
Mahomes, a two-time NFL MVP, has the Chiefs on the brink of claiming his fourth Super Bowl victory and third consecutive win despite doing it with very different personnel surrounding him. 
Malcolm Smith, a seventh-round pick who never received another major accolade in his 11-year career, was the Super Bowl XLVIII MVP as a linebacker after a sensational performance for the Seattle Seahawks. Before Super Bowl LIX kicks off, let's take a look at the 10 most iconic Super Bowl MVP performances in the history of the game. Ranking Top  
Lynn Swaan had one of the Best Super Bowl performances of all time and he was awarded with being the first wide receiver to ever win a Super Bowl MVP. He racked up 161 yards and a touchdown on only 4 receptions; however, he had one of the most famous catches of all time with his balance and ball tracking skills being able to complete the reception. 
Super Bowl 50: Denver Broncos 24, Carolina Panthers 10 MVP: Von Miller | Location: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif. | Date: Feb. 7, 2016; Super Bowl XLIX: New  
Patrick Mahomes is now one of five players in NFL history with at least 5 total MVPs (Regular Season + Super Bowl) upvotes  
There have been 8 wide receivers to win the Super Bowl MVP award, and I have ranked their performances: 8. Fred Biletnikoff Super Bowl XI (Original Caption) Fred Biletnikoff (25) playing for Oakland in Super Bowl against Minnesota. Biletnikoff’s performance is underwhelming when considering how explosive the rest of the players on this list are. 
There were a lot of guys that could have been considered. Butker and McDuffie would have been my other 2, but the stat line considering the pressure he was under from the D-Line along with 3 clutch drives in the second half including the GW makes it hard to ignore. 
Super Bowl MVP, Position, Team Stat line I Bart Starr, QB, Green Bay Two touchdown passes in the Packers' 35-10 win over the Chiefs: II 
I think something along the lines of 250+ yards, 65% completion, 1 INT or less and 3+ TDs should be enough since the awards is for the most VALUABLE player, not the best. A QB putting those numbers and winning means he was the most valuable since QB is the position that has more impact on the field. 
The largest difference was both 2017 and 2018, in which the Super Bowl Winner's defense was 22nd places higher than the MVP Best defense to win the Super Bowl; tied 2013 Broncos/2015 Panthers. Worst defense to win the Super Bowl; 2011 Giants (Only team with a defensive EPA/Play ranked in the bottom half of the league). </p>
