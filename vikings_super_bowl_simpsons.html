When Homer asks the Viking masseuse what Vikings can't do, the masseuse responds with "Win the Super Bowl", a reference to the Minnesota Vikings NFL team never winning a Super Bowl (the Vikings did reach the Super Bowl four times but lost all four).

1. Super Bowl Predictions. In 1992, Lisa Simpson predicted the team would win the Super Bown in season 3, Episode 14. It was Super Bowl XXVI, and she said the Washington Redskins would win. This ended up coming true. 2. Simpsons Predict the Super Bowl, Again! In 1993, the Simpsons made another prediction for who would win the Super Bowl. 
Mythology Gag: Wally Kogen is named for classic Simpsons writers Wallace Wolodarsky and Jay Kogen, who'd written for the show during the first 4 seasons, including the original "Treehouse of Horror" special, "Bart The Daredevil", and "Lisa the Greek", which was also about the Super Bowl.

The Vikings squandered a 12-2 record the following year, giving up a lead to the Cowboys in the Division round. In 1976, Tarkenton, Foreman, and receiver Sammy White led the team to its fourth Super Bowl in eight seasons. Oakland scored the first 19 points in Super Bowl XI and the Raiders went on to win, 32-14.

Have the Vikings Ever Won the Super Bowl? No. The Minnesota Vikings have never won the Super Bowl. The Vikings have reached the Super Bowl a total of four times (1970, 1974, 1975, and 1977) but have never won. They are one of two teams in NFL history that have reached the Super Bowl four times without a win. The other is the Buffalo Bills. </p>
