        <h2><strong>what super bowl did the philadelphia eagles win ultimo super bowl chiefs</strong></h2>
        <p>The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
The Eagles have won just one Super Bowl during their franchise's history. That came in Super Bowl 52, which was played in 2018 as part of the 2017 NFL playoffs. 
While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have won the Super Bowl a single time, in the 2017 season. Additionally, the Philadelphia Eagles have won the NFL Championship 3 times, most recently in the 1960 season. 
The Philadelphia Eagles are going back to the Super Bowl. Top-seeded Philadelphia defeated the division rival No. 6 Washington Commanders 55-23 in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday, setting the  
Super Bowl: 4 (1-3) Pre-Super Bowl Championships: 4 (3-1) In all, the Philadelphia Eagles have played 54 postseason games in their 90+ year history. They are currently 28-26 in those contests. Their conference championship record sits at 5-4, and they are 1-3 in Super Bowls. They did win three championships in the pre-Super Bowl era (1948, 1949  
Despite a late surge by the Patriots, the Eagles’ defense, led by Brandon Graham, made a crucial strip-sack of Brady in the final minutes. Philadelphia emerged victorious with a 41-33 win, and Nick Foles was named Super Bowl MVP. The triumph marked the franchise’s first Super Bowl win and solidified their place in NFL history. 
The Eagles have just one Super Bowl win, where they bested the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII (2018). Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl history: Super Bowl 1981: 27-10 loss to the  
The Philadelphia Eagles have only won one Vince Lombardi trophy and that came in their Super Bowl appearance back in 2018. With backup quarterback Nick Foles having to start for the Eagles with starter Carson Wentz injured, it seemed like the writing was on the wall against a New England Patriots team led by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. 
Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl win years: What years did the Eagles win the Super Bowl? The Eagles have played four Super Bowls but won only one of them, as of January 2025. Philly will be  
The Philadelphia Eagles fell just short of winning Super Bowl LVII and are now seeking revenge on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. While the team has had plenty of success since 2017, it  
The last — and only — time the Eagles won the Super Bowl in 2018, they famously snubbed the former and current president. “The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow,” Trump said in a statement the last time the Eagles snubbed the offer. 
Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) scores a touchdown past Philadelphia Eagles safety Marcus Epps (22) during the first quarter in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on  
The Philadelphia Eagles are back in the Super Bowl for the first time in five years after easy wins over the New York Giants and the San Francisco 49ers in their first two playoff games.. They  
The Philadelphia Eagles have won one Super Bowl in franchise history. The Eagles were champions of the 2017 NFL season after beating the Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. Before the Super Bowl era, the Eagles won three NFL Championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960. 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles play on Sunday, Feb. 9 at Caesars Superdome in the Super Bowl game of the NFL playoffs. Will the Eagles or the Chiefs win the Super Bowl? The Chiefs  
Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, Nelson Agholor, Zach Ertz, Trey Burton, Brent Celek, Jay Ajayi, LeGarrette Blount, and Corey Clement all had critical roles as skill-position players in the win. No Eagles player accumulated more than 1,000 yards this year, making it the first team to win the Super Bowl with that stat since the New York Giants in  
Team History. The Eagles have won four NFL championships and one Super Bowl. Their previous titles came before the Super Bowl era (1948, 1949, 1960). In 1978, the Eagles pulled out an improbable win over the New York Giants after the Giants fumbled the football in the final seconds while attempting to run out the clock. 
The Philadelphia Eagles won Super Bowl LII over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. The Eagles aren't universally-beloved, by any means, but even Giants fans were rooting for Philly to knock  
The last time the Eagles earned an N.F.L. championship, in the pre-Super Bowl era, they also conquered an iconic coach in Vince Lombardi and a Hall of Fame quarterback in Bart Starr, but that win  </p>
