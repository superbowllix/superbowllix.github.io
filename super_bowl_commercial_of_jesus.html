        <p>Jesus Commercial at Super Bowl 2025: “He Gets Us” Returns to Champion Love and Community. This year’s Big Game is shaping up to be more than just a showdown on the gridiron—He Gets Us, a campaign dedicated to reshaping the public perception of Jesus, is once again airing a commercial during Super Bowl 2025. This marks the campaign’s  
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Who Is My Neighbor,” the 15-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” 
But in this scenario, "He" is the center of a marketing campaign that has spread far across the U.S., spanning between billboards, banner ads online, and a forthcoming Super Bowl commercial. 
The ad will explore “how Jesus redefined true greatness.” Lerma, the lead creative agency behind He Gets Us’ previous Super Bowl spots, created the 2025 ad as well. 
It’s becoming a Super Bowl tradition: He Gets Us, the billion-dollar effort to overhaul the public image of Jesus, the Son of God, will be back on the airwaves during Super Bowl LIX. Greg Miller  
Green discussed his involvement in the campaign, and the Super Bowl ad spots, during a November 2022 interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck. “We are wanting to say — ‘we

A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines.

Most Super Bowl adverts plug things like fizzy drink and cars, but one of the most talked-about commercials the day after the big game was selling Jesus - and it upset several very different

A Christian commercial about Jesus that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday angered some conservatives who felt like the advertisement justified certain sins. 
“He Gets Us,” the ad campaign centered around rebranding Jesus for the contemporary world, will be returning to the Super Bowl in 2025. Come Near, the non-profit that manages the “He Gets Us

As the final countdown to Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, begins, it’s clear that Matthew McConaughey stars in Uber Eats Super Bowl Ad 2025 with a mission: to tickle our funny bones while encouraging us to get even hungrier—and, of course, order from the Uber Eats app when cravings strike. 
Setting a record with a staggering 123.4 million viewers, the Super Bowl was the most-watched American television broadcast in a generation, and all of those 
The 2024 Super Bowl featured a "He Gets Us" commercial. Viewers who caught it may be wondering about the song played during and who the voice behind it was. 
He Gets Us Super Bowl Ad 2024 – A moment of humility in a time of glory: The ‘Foot Washing’ ad by He Gets Us. The “Foot Washing” advert’s placement in the Super Bowl lineup could amplify its message to a vast audience, offering a moment of introspection amid the event’s festivities. 
After making a splash on America's biggest secular holiday with two ads during last year's Super Bowl, "He Gets Us" is back airing more spots during Super Bowl 58.. Both of last year's commercials
