        <h2><strong>super bowl wins bears did kanye super bowl commercial air</strong></h2>
        <p>This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos). 
How many Super Bowls have the Chicago Bears won? The Chicago Bears have won one Super Bowl in two appearances as of 2024. The Bears won Super Bowl XX in 1985. It was the first-ever

The Bears won Super Bowl XX, the first one they appeared in. That season was famous for the release of the "Super Bowl Shuffle," a quintessentially '80s rap song that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 immediately following Chicago's championship and is still talked about today. 
Led by LB Brian Urlacher, WR Devin Hester, and QB Rex Grossman, the Bears won the NFC North with a 13-3 record and then defeated the Seattle Seahawks and New Orleans Saints on their path to the Super Bowl. Super Bowl XLI, played on Feb. 4, 2007, pitted the Bears against the Indianapolis Colts. 
For decades, now, Chicago Bears fans have held on dearly to the lone Super Bowl victory back when the 1985 squad brought home the Lombardi Trophy. It is one of the only firm achievements 
February 4, 2007: Highly-regarded quarterback Peyton Manning and head coach Tony Dungy each won their first Super Bowl title when they led the Indianapolis Colts to a 29-17 victory in the Miami, Fla. rain versus the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI. 
The detail of the Bears’ Super Bowl victory is as follows: 1985: Super Bowl XX After an example season of 15 wins, the Chicago Bears hosted the Patriots in New Orleans, Louisiana, in January 1986. 
Hester's touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the ninth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only three of the nine teams who did this went on to win the game (the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI, the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowls XXXV and XLVII, and the Seattle Seahawks in  
Super Bowl XX was played on January 26, 1986, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. This was the fourth Super Bowl and, to date, the last time in which both teams made their Super Bowl debuts. [a] The Bears entered the game after becoming the 
The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. [192] 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
In 2020, the Chicago Bears lost to the New Orleans Saints in the Wild Card Round. What years did the Bears make the Super Bowl? The Chicago Bears have appeared in the Super Bowl 2 times, in 1985 and 2006. 
2007 Super Bowl (41): Indianapolis Colts 29, Chicago Bears 17 2008 Super Bowl (42): New York Giants 17, New England Patriots 14 2009 Super Bowl (43): Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Arizona Cardinals 23

They defeated the New England Patriots 46-10 to cap off one of the greatest defensive seasons in NFL history. Super Bowl XX: vs. Patriots. The Bears won their  
In one of the greatest moments in franchise history, the 1985 Bears beat the New England Patriots 46-10 in Super Bowl XX 32 years ago Friday.
