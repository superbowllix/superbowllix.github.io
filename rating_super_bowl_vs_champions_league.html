        <p>The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to date. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
The Champions League final vs. Super Bowl argument rages on between football and soccer (also known as “football”) fans. It’s the biggest game of the season in either sport, as the Super Bowl is the marquee matchup in the United States, while the Champions League final rules the parts of the world, where soccer reigns supreme. 
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
Real Madrid lifted a 14th European Cup / Champions League title on Saturday night in a game that will have been watched across the world.. While figures for the 2022 Champions League final global viewership are not yet finalized, the 2021 final between Chelsea and Manchester City pulled in an estimated 700 million viewers, a remarkable figure given the two clubs in question play in the same  
The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
The Champions League has also now incorporated a Super Bowl-esque showbiz element with on-field musical performances before kick-off. So, while the Super Bowl is, and likely will always be, the king of US sports, the wider sporting world pays much more attention to the Champions League final. 
Super Bowl 2015: New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks The Patriots beat the Seahawks 28-24 in Super Bowl 2015. As per reports, a total of 114.4 viewers tuned in to watch the game. 
However, there’s another annual sporting event that competes with the Champions League Final in terms of popularity and revenue: the US’s Super Bowl Sunday, which concludes the NFL season. Back in 2015, the Super Bowl brought in 114 million viewers compared to the Champions League Final’s 380 million, according to Infographics. 
Champions League has a bigger viewership when its two popular teams like Real Madrid, Man U, Barcelonaetc, but when its Inter vs. Bayern or some of these smaller teams then the Super Bowl wins. Reply reply 
Combined Twitter Following: 25.5M (Champions League) vs. 2.22M (Super Bowl) Champions League has over 10x the number of Twitter followers but only third of the total tweets. According to my quick math, Super Bowl viewers are tweeting 38 times more per Twitter follower compared to Champions League viewers. 
With the 2021 Super Bowl 55 about to take place and the 2021 Champions League also very much underway i thought i would battle the two against eachother to s

In American football, underdogs are a little easier to determine. Five wildcard teams in the past 23 years have won the Super Bowl: the Denver Broncos in 1997-98 (despite having the second-best

The Super Bowl is the sports ratings king of the United States, but it seems it has to settle for second place as an annual worldwide sports spectacle. Reuters: UEFA’s Champions League final has for the first time replaced the NFL’s Super Bowl as the most-watched annual sports event, according to a survey. 
A pesar de ello, en el país de las Barras y las Estrellas, la final de la Champions fue vista únicamente por 2.6 millones de personas entre CBS y Paramount, es decir menos del 1% de Estados Unidos vio la final del torneo más importante de Europa a nivel de clubes. 
Both the Super Bowl and the Champions League final occur annually and both pit professional organizations against each other, rather than national teams. But yet again, the comparison ends with
