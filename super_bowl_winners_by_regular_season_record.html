The years listed indicate the year the Super Bowl was played, the regular season is played during the year before. The New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers have won the most Super Bowls, with six wins each. 
Players and teams, along with their records, are noted with the Super Bowl game played. All records can be referenced at the National Football League (NFL)'s official website, NFL.com.

The Green Bay Packers had a record of 1-0 in Super Bowls in Super Bowl I against the Chiefs on January 15, 1967.

8 teams are tied for the worst record in Super Bowls, with a record of 0-1. The first three are the Arizona Cardinals, the Carolina Panthers and the Tennessee Titans. 
There is simply no denying that the 2011 New York Giants are one of if not the most improbable Super Bowl winners in history. They had a middling 9-7 record in the regular season, going 2-4 in their final six games. The Giants had to go play away games at Green Bay and San Francisco to make it to the Super Bowl. 
The New York Jets defeating the then-Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III remains the biggest upset in Super Bowl history. The Colts were 18-point favorites before getting stunned by Broadway Joe
