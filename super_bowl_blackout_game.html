        <p>The 34-minute delay created two distinct halves of football and, according to the Ravens, nearly cost them a Super Bowl title.  It was as if the blackout had created two distinct games. 
Last Updated 9:16 a.m. ET. NEW ORLEANS Super Bowl XLVII's dramatic second half was made more so by a power blackout, which halted play and left millions of TV viewers in the dark.. The biggest pro  
Super Bowl XLVII was a thriller between the 49ers and Ravens, but it will forever be remembered for the power outage inside the Superdome.

The outage, which lasted more than thirty minutes, makes Super Bowl 47 one of the most memorable Super Bowls in history. The game featured 34 minutes of darkness and a stunning second-half comeback. 
Super Bowl 59 will be the first held in the city since 2013, when a power outage delayed the game for 34 minutes – the first and only time the nation's biggest sporting event has been delayed by  
And at that moment, it was clear that the legacy of that Super Bowl wouldn't be the final game of Ray Lewis' Hall of Fame career, Colin Kaepernick's last moment on the NFL's biggest stage, the

The Baltimore Ravens grabbed all the momentum to start the second half after a Jacoby Jones touchdown, but then the lights went out. Get a sneak peek at what 
The game marked the first Super Bowl in which both of the teams had appeared, but had not yet lost a previous Super Bowl; the 49ers came into the game having won all five of their previous Super Bowl appearances, while the Ravens had won in their lone previous Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. 
The last Super Bowl played in New Orleans has gone down as the ‘Blackout Bowl’, due to a 34-minute power outage in the Superdome shortly after Beyonce’s half-time show. Sandwiching the powercut was another hugely entertaining game as brothers John and Jim Harbaugh faced off as the Ravens and 49ers head coaches.
