        <p>The next year, Super Bowl LVII had a color scheme of green and red and the two teams to make the Super Bowl were the  Ranji Trophy 2024; Women's U-19 T20 WC 2025; BPL 2024; Super Smash 2024; 
In the last 10 years, the only teams to win a championship wearing a different color were the teams competing in this year's Super Bowl: the Eagles (in Super Bowl 52) and the Chiefs (in Super  
The Super Bowl is headed to New Orleans in 2025. New Orleans was actually supposed to host Super Bowl LVIII this year, but the city had to give up hosting duties after the NFL added an extra week  
Super Bowls 51 through 55 (2017-21) went solely with Roman numerals and a Lombardi Trophy, with a rotating color band over the words "Super Bowl" at the bottom. 
This year, the 2024 Super Bowl logo mixes purple and red — and both of those colors correspond with the teams still vying for a spot in the NFL Championship game. 
This year, for Super Bowl LIX, the logo has a similar layout to the one the NFL has used since 2017: A silver Lombardi Trophy runs through the middle of the Roman numerals, all of which sit atop a horizontal bar reading “Super Bowl.” But as the Big Game returns to New Orleans, the logo is also markedly different. 
The day after the Chiefs defeated the Eagles at Super Bowl 57 in February of 2023, the league revealed the logo for Super Bowl 58. So the design and color scheme was determined well before the  
Starting with Super Bowl XLV in 2011, the Lombardi Trophy became a prominent part of the logo, and silver was the only color featured until gold was incorporated for Super Bowl 50 (2016).

The National Football League’s (NFL) forthcoming championship game, Super Bowl LIX, is set for February 9, 2025. This will be the 59th Super Bowl in NFL history. The event will occur at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
The Super Bowl logo opened a new chapter in the race for the trophy, focusing attention on the location of the year’s main game. The designers faced a tough challenge: they had to do everything possible to shift sports fans’ attention from the Winter Olympics to the contest of the best U.S. football teams. 
The Super Bowl is currently played in early February (the game originally took place in early to mid-January), culminating a regular season that generally begins in September of the previous calendar year. For example, Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, determined the league champion for the 2015 NFL season. The years shown  
By strategically adding bright green accents to their classic blue and gray colors, they achieved a 32% boost in merchandise sales in just the first year.

When it comes to the Super Bowl, color has always been a big deal: the sterling silver shine of the Lombardi Trophy, the neon splash of a victorious Gatorade bath, the glory of franchise-colored  
The original trophy was produced by Tiffany &amp; Co. in New Jersey, but as of 2017, it has been made in Cumberland, Rhode Island. They say that winning the Super Bowl Trophy is priceless. Well, that’s not entirely accurate. The trophy costs $50,000 to produce and takes four months and 72 hours of labor to complete. Do Players Get Their Own Super
