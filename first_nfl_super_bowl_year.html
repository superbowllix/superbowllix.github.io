        <p>The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL. The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) – winning the last two. 
The first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (known retroactively as Super Bowl I and referred to in contemporaneous reports, including the game's radio broadcast, as the Super Bowl) [5] was an American football game played on January 15, 1967, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California.

Super Bowl 1 Marked the Start of the NFL-AFL Merger. The Packers won Super Bowl 1 and Super Bowl 2, but the AFL soon got its revenge in Super Bowl 3. New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed a victory over the Baltimore Colts and ultimately delivered with a 16-7 win, giving the AFL its first Super Bowl win. The Chiefs, losers of Super

Who won the first Super Bowl and what was the score? The Green Bay Packers emerged victorious in the first-ever Super Bowl (AFL-NFL World Championship Game), defeating the Kansas City Chiefs with a commanding score of 35-10. The game was played on January 15, 1967, at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. 
They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do so (after the 1990s Dallas Cowboys). In Super Bowl XXXVI, first-year starting quarterback Tom Brady led his team to a 20–17 upset victory over the St. Louis Rams, who two seasons earlier won Super Bowl XXXIV. [78] [79] Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. 
The first-ever Super Bowl featured the NFL's Green Bay Packers taking on the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs, with the Packers taking an easy 35-10 victory. Green Bay also won the title the following  
Super Bowl, in U.S. professional gridiron football, the championship game of the National Football league, played by the winners of the league’s American Football Conference and National Football Conference each January or February. The game is hosted by a different city each year. 
They are the first defense to enter the Super Bowl ranked first in both categories since the 2014 Seattle Seahawks, who would have won the Super Bowl if Marshawn Lynch got the ball on the goal line. 
The soon-to-be named NFL Offensive Player of Year found the end zone 13 times in the regular season and five more times in the playoffs, easily a new-career high for the former No. 2 overall pick

Entering Super Bowl 59 this year, Philadelphia has been to four NFL title games and holds a 1-3 record in Super Bowl matchups. The Eagles lost in each of their first two Super Bowl appearances.

With Super Bowl LIX set for February 9, 2025, let's review the history of the game. The first-ever AFL-NFL World Championship Game in professional American football is also known as Super Bowl I  
USATSI 1. Super Bowl LIX will be held on Sunday, Feb. 9. 2. The Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles in the big game.. 3. Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. 
Considering how expensive it is to purchase air time during the Super Bowl -- a 30-second spot will cost around $8 million this year -- it only makes sense that these companies would leave all on  
Super Bowl LIX has the makings of a classic, as the Chiefs look to complete the NFL's first three-peat, while the Eagles aim to avenge their loss to Kansas City two years ago. Here are the FOX  
NEW ORLEANS -- The first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, and in the 58 years since then, no sitting president has ever attended the game, but that's going to change this year. Donald Trump  </p>
