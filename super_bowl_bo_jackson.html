        <p>Called "the greatest athlete in video game history", [60] Jackson's digital counterpart was nicknamed by fans "Tecmo Bo" since being featured in the 1991 video game Tecmo Super Bowl for the Nintendo Entertainment System, where he is all but untacklable.

During his Pro Bowl season (1990), Jackson rushed for 698 yards and five touchdowns (for a 5.6 yards-per-carry average) despite receiving just 125 carries. On one side: Bo Jackson trucking defenders.

On defense, four CBs have 75 like Bo (Rod Woodson, Deion Sanders, Darrell Green, and  Wayne Haddix of TB). But I think the numbers have different meanings on D, since on long runs, defenders can almost ALWAYS catch up to the offensive players--or at least make headway.

Jackson’s career was unfortunately cut short in 1991 due to a severe hip injury, preventing him from achieving this pinnacle accomplishment in professional football. </p>
