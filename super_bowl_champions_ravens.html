        <p>Baltimore Ravens A (1, 1–0)  In the intervening year, they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos. 
Baltimore Ravens: 34: New York Giants: 7: Ray Lewis+ Raymond James Stadium: Tampa: Florida: Jan 30, 2000: XXXIV (34)  You are here: PFR Home Page &gt; Super Bowl

The Ravens were champions in both appearances they've made, in Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII. By Jason Butt Jan 28, 2015, 11:01am EST Share this story 
The Baltimore Ravens last won the Super Bowl in the 2012 season. The Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in the Super Bowl. 
The Ravens went on to breeze through the postseason — rolling past the Denver Broncos, the top-seeded and defending AFC champion Tennessee Titans, and then the Oakland Raiders to secure the conference title. Baltimore ended its run by dismantling the New York Giants in the Super Bowl. 
Coming off as the defending Super Bowl champions, this was the first year in franchise history for the team without Ray Lewis. [82] The Ravens started out 3–2, and started the 2–0 Houston Texans 14-loss streak by shutting them 30–9 in Week 3. 
Here are the Ravens’ Super Bowl appearances: XXXV: Ravens 34, Giants 7 (2001) XLVII: Ravens 34, 49ers 31 (2013) What teams did the Baltimore Ravens win the Super Bowl against? The Baltimore  
The Ravens’ two Super Bowl appearances were both wins. In Super Bowl XXXV, which was played on Jan. 28, 2001, Baltimore recorded a dominant 34-7 victory over the New York Giants . Baltimore allowed only 152 yards of offense by New York — the third-lowest total ever in a Super Bowl — while also recording four sacks and forcing five turnovers. 
The formula for the Baltimore Ravens at the Super Bowl is simple: Make it to the big game and win. Baltimore has played in two Super Bowls and won both of them, scoring 34 points in each. They have yet to taste defeat on the grandest stage, but they also only make it to the title game every decade or so. 
Believe It, Baltimore, your Ravens are once again Super Bowl Champions! With their thrilling 34-31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, the Ravens put an exclamation point at the end of Ray Lewis' Hall Of Fame career, and rode the talents of Lewis, quarterback Joe Flacco, tailback Ray Rice and a host of others to the second World Championship in franchise history. 
Today we have Super Bowl XLVII, held on February 3, 2013 at Mercedes-Benz Superdome between the six-time NFC champion San Francisco 49ers and the two-time AFC champion Baltimore Ravens. As always, we have a pop quiz, and then homework at the end of the episode.

Francine Lubera and Kevin Byrne of the Ravens' public relations office chronicled the run to the Super Bowl in the book "Super Journey: Diary of the Ravens World Championship Season", published in

The Baltimore Ravens have won 2 Super Bowls as they were crowned champions of the 2000 and 2012 NFL seasons. They defeated the Giants 34-7 in Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 and they beat the 49ers 34-31 in 2013 in Super Bowl XLVII.

Super Bowl XLVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2012 season. 
Polymarket | This market will resolve to "Yes" if the Kansas City Chiefs win Super Bowl LIX. Otherwise, this market will resolve to "No". If at any point it becomes impossible for this team to win the Super Bowl based on the rules of the NFL (e.g. they are eliminated in the playoff bracket), this market will resolve immediately to "No". 
On Feb. 3, 2013, the AFC Champion Ravens battled the NFC Champion 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. It was the first time in NFL history that two brothers, John and Jim Harbaugh, faced each other as head  </p>
