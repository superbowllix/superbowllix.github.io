        <p>As visitors gather in New Orleans this week and millions tune into the Super Bowl on Sunday, Williams will be celebrating her artistry and culture. “I come from a great and beautiful culture, and I want the world to see it the same way as I do,” said Williams, 26, who is the first person to handcraft both the Super Bowl logo and theme art. 
This part of the 2025 Super Bowl logo is the most prominent because the vividly painted Roman numerals “LIX” occupy most of the space. Between them, just after the “L,” stands the silver Vince Lombardi Trophy—a football, rising on a vertical pedestal with a heraldic shield and the “NFL” inscription. 
The NFL has unveiled the official logo for Super Bowl LIX, which will take place on February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.

This year, for Super Bowl LIX, the logo has a similar layout to the one the NFL has used since 2017: A silver Lombardi Trophy runs through the middle of the Roman numerals, all of which sit atop a horizontal bar reading “Super Bowl.” But as the Big Game returns to New Orleans, the logo is also markedly different. 
The Super Bowl 59 logo follows the same pattern, but it also marks the first time the NFL has collaborated with an artist local to the championship city to craft the Big Game's logo.

NEW YORK – Jan. 8, 2025 – The NFL announced today that renowned New Orleans artist Tahj 'Queen Tahj' Williams will be the first ever to handcraft both the Super Bowl logo and theme art for Super Bowl LIX. Following her debut as the first artist to create a Super Bowl logo, the NFL has unveiled Queen Tahj’s Super Bowl LIX theme art. 
The Super Bowl is headed to New Orleans in 2025. New Orleans was actually supposed to host Super Bowl LVIII this year, but the city had to give up hosting duties after the NFL added an extra week  
With Super Bowl LVIII now in the books, the NFL has revealed the logo for next year’s Super Bowl, which will take place on Feb. 9, 2025, at the Superdome in New Orleans. The logo design is shown above. If the Roman numerals look textured, that’s because the logo was originally rendered in little colored beads by its designer, Tahj Williams. 
The Super Bowl logo, including the Super Bowl LIX 2025 logo in vector, is the exclusive intellectual property of the NFL (National Football League). It should only be used for personal, non-commercial purposes and without any profit-making intentions.

The Super Bowl 2025 logo has just been revealed, and it’s an exciting blend of old-school tradition and modern design trends. Honoring the Tradition of Super Bowl The 2025 logo is rooted in the NFL’s rich history, keeping some of the classic elements we’ve come to expect. 
Super Bowl Logo 2021. The Super Bowl 2021 logo resembles the 2020 emblem because it uses two accent colors. However, while the Roman numerals previously emitted a warm yellow glow, they now evoke a sense of coldness due to the blue gradient. The gradient shift appears dynamic thanks to the contrast between the light top and the dark bottom. 
In 2023, a placeholder logo was introduced for early promotion of the event. On February 12, 2024, one day after Super Bowl LVIII, the National Football League unveiled an official logo for the event. The NFL collaborated with New Orleans-based artist Tahj Williams to design the logo.[1] The event is scheduled to take place at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. </p>
