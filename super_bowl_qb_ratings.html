        <p>Against the Seahawks, Big Ben recorded the worst passer rating of any Super Bowl-winning quarterback. But what the stat line doesn't show is Roethlisberger's 37-yard completion on a third-and-28  
Seattle hung 43 points on Denver in Super Bowl 48, and Wilson was a big reason for it, being one of four quarterbacks to ever produce an elite passing grade in the Super Bowl. Wilson was especially effective in a clean pocket, improving his grade to 92.4 while completing 17 of 22 attempts for 199 yards with three big-time throws. 
Bradshaw threw for 300-plus yards in half his Super Bowls which, in the 1970s, was the quarterback equivalent of going to the moon (Super Bowl XII, in 1978, featured 217 total net passing yards). 
Super Bowl III: New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7. Passer rating: 9.3. Passing stats: 6-for-17, 71 yards, 0 TD/3 INT. In the first game to be officially dubbed “Super Bowl” — the first two iterations were known as the AFL-NFL World Championship Game and retroactively renamed — Morrall and the Colts went down to Joe Namath and the Jets in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history.

Completions: 22 for 25, 268 yards, three touchdowns Quarterback rating: 150.9. Simms’ performance against the Broncos was the single-most efficient game in Super Bowl history. 
His passer rating of 140.7 is among the highest for a Super Bowl starter. 10. Joe Namath, Jets, Super Bowl III  Williams was the first Black quarterback to win the Super Bowl. 1. Steve Young  
Here are the 10 highest rushing yard outputs in Super Bowl history by a quarterback: Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl LVII: 70 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs, Super Bowl LVIII: 66 
I ranked all quarterbacks based on career achievements, with regular-season excellence, All-Pro/Pro Bowl appearances and seasons as top-five and top-10 players at the position carrying more weight  
4 players are tied for the best passer rating in a Super Bowl, with a 158.3 rating. The first three are Jauan Jennings on February 11, Antwaan Randle El on February 5, 2006 and Lawrence McCutcheon on January 20, 1980. 
Phil Simms has the best passer rating by a quarterback in a Super Bowl, with a 150.9 rating in Super Bowl XXI against the Broncos on January 25, 1987.

More than any Super Bowl quarterback matchup yet, Mahomes of the Chiefs vs. Jalen Hurts of the Eagles represents the rise of the Black quarterback and the youth movement at the position. 
4 players are tied for the best passer rating in a Super Bowl, with a 158.3 rating. The first three are Jauan Jennings on February 11, Antwaan Randle El on February 5, 2006 and Lawrence McCutcheon on January 20, 1980.
