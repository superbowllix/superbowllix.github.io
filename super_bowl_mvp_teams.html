The Super Bowl MVP voting system is a bit complex. The MVP is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel’s ballots count for 80% of the vote tally, while the viewers’ ballots make up the other 20%. 
The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League’s (NFL) championship game. The winner is selected by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, along with fan votes. 
A total of seven QBs have won both NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP. Patrick Mahomes was the last to accomplish the feat, having done so in 2023. Here is the full list of players who won both an NFL MVP

A Super Bowl MVP would certainly put a bow on Barkley's impeccable 2024-25 season, which might be the most dominating regular-season and playoff campaign by a running back in NFL history.
