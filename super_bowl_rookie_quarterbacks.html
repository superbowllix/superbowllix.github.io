        <h2><strong>super bowl rookie quarterbacks super bowl minute pool results</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl is the biggest game in the NFL, and only one quarterback gets to win it every season. That's one out of 32 starting quarterbacks in the top American football league in the world. 
Rookie quarterbacks have made the AFC and NFC championship games but have not gone on to the Super Bowl. These include Ben Roethlisberger, Joe Flacco and Mark Sanchez. NFL rookie QBs have a lowly  
No rookie quarterback has ever started in the Super Bowl. In fact, just five quarterbacks have ever gotten the starting nod during conference championship week, with Jayden Daniels set to make it six. 
Daniels would be the first rookie quarterback to ever start a Super Bowl if the Commanders win. Other rookies have come close. Daniels is the sixth rookie QB to ever play in a championship game. 
In fact, no rookie quarterback has even started a Super Bowl. MORE: How Jayden Daniels ranks among NFL's best rookie QBs ever. Has a rookie QB ever won a Super Bowl? The short answer is, no, no  
The Youngest QB To Win The Super Bowl. While no rookie has claimed a Super Bowl title, a young quarterback still holds the record for the youngest to do so. Ben Roethlisberger won Super Bowl XL in  
The answer: no. A rookie QB has NEVER won the Super Bowl. Tom Brady won a Super Bowl in his SECOND year in the league. After all, he was with the team in 2000, throwing three passes for one completion, and then won a Super Bowl the following year. Brady was not a rookie in 2001. Mahomes won a Super Bowl at an early age but was also not a rookie. 
Another problem with rookie QBs making the Super Bowl is some rookies don’t see the field in their first year. If an organization is in win-now mode, they might prefer for their rookie QB to sit  
While no rookie has claimed a Super Bowl title, a young quarterback still holds the record for the youngest to do so. Ben Roethlisberger won Super Bowl XL in 2006 at just 23 years old. He led the Steelers to a 21-10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks with help from a dominant defense and wide receiver Hines Ward, who earned MVP honors. 
In NFL history, only six rookie quarterbacks have started in a Conference Championship game in their first year, with none making it to the Super Bowl. Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders vs  
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
A rookie quarterback has never reached the Super Bowl. There have been players who have been close to reaching that feat, including Brock Purdy ( 49ers ), reaching the NFC Championship but falling  
Thinking about it, one might wonder: Has a rookie QB ever won the Super Bowl? Simply put, no rookie has ever guided their team to a Super Bowl. If Stroud were to beat the top AFC seed and then clinch the Conference Championship, the rookie QB would etch his name in NFL history to achieve this milestone. 
How many rookie quarterbacks have started in, won a Super Bowl? All five of those quarterbacks suffered conference championship game losses. So, Daniels has a chance to become the first rookie QB  
The National Football League has been around for a long time. However, in its storied existence, not once has a rookie QB managed to win the Super Bowl as a starter. There are a number of reasons why it’s so difficult for a rookie QB to lead a team to the Super Bowl. First of all, rookie QBs tend to be drafted by teams that are rebuilding. 
Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger became the youngest starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl in NFL history thanks to the team's 21-10 defeat over the Seahawks in 2006's Super  
Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels has a chance to become the first rookie QB to ever start in a Super Bowl. By Allison DeGrushe Published Jan. 24 2025, 4:54 p.m. ET 
Seneca Wallace didn't win in his rookie season in Super Bowls in Super Bowl XL versus the Steelers on February 5, 2006. Toggle Theme.  nfl 2024 rookie qb stats. 3 . 
And then at age 26 in year 5, he was comfortable in his second Super Bowl. Idk how the stats reflect that progression, especially with how the OL was almost a polar opposite in 2008 from how it was in 2005, but that’s what I remember watching. 
Daniels would be the first rookie quarterback to ever start a Super Bowl if the Commanders win. Other rookies have come close. Daniels is the sixth rookie QB to ever play in a championship game. </p>
