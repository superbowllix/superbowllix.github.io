        <h2><strong>super bowl paramount plus not working reddit super bowl 2025 located</strong></h2>
        <p>Paramount Plus needs much fixing in the next week if they want to stream the Super Bowl smoothly. Edit: Paramount Plus sometimes shows "Optimizing video playback" and it buffers sometimes. I think the app has improved a lot, but I am just wondering if Paramount Plus is ready for how much traffic the Super Bowl will create. 
Gotcha! It’s the best for live sports. It’s the fastest broadcast so you don’t get spoiler notifications and the signal has a consistent birate so the quality is consistently high. The Super Bowl, World Series, and NBA finals are all OTA and look better and have a much easier experience than any streaming platform. 
Be aware.. I ( and some others I’ve seen on Reddit) could not stream the AFC championship game Sunday on my Roku. Have no idea why and couldn’t get any support from Paramount+. I ended up streaming it on my phone and casting to the TV. I have zero confidence Super Bowl will be any different. 
Paramount Plus went down for many viewers who were trying to tune in to watch the Kansas City Chiefs play the San Francisco 49ers in the 2024 Super Bowl on February 11, 2024.. According to KRON4  
Unfortunately for CBS and Paramount, this isn’t a new issue for them when it comes to streaming the Super Bowl. We’ll continue to monitor the issue, which cannot make the NFL happy. 
At 14:23 in quarter 1 of super bowl I get the spinning wheel "hang tight" and then video is lost. Done. — Jeremy Wojtecki (@jwojPAC) February 11, 2024 Edward Sutelan 
Yes, currently, we are experiencing the issue(s) listed below, but we can update you as soon as this gets resolved! Just use these steps so we can notify you: 
Paramount Plus users were left gutted ahead of the Super Bowl LVIII kick-off in Las Vegas.The Las Vegas spectacle places the Kansas City Chiefs against the San Francisco 49ers, but fans found reason to fume before the match had even started thanks to the streaming service's crashes and dropouts.The  
Checked for updates. There are none. My system is up to date. Can’t buy Patamouht plus to see Super Bowl. Get your act together Roku. I bought direct from Paramount plus site and ran hdmi from laptop to tv 
I am constantly having all kinds of problems with Paramount Plus. Currently, it’s the constant lagging and buffering. It sucks because it has Showtime shows but I’m so close to canceling my subscription. I don’t understand why/how they can’t get it together.. 
The tv brand companies do not update OS and apps like Apple. It’s all about contracts. That being said paramount plus is not great. I’m t has a tendency to glitch and not allow to scroll down and a terrible sidebar, but I use it often and it’s not too bad. I’ve seen worse. But as an IT guy, it’s the OS and app, and device itself. 
So to reiterate, I'd rather watch 1080p -&gt; pseudo 4K -&gt; pseudo 4K HEVC than 1080p -&gt; 1080p h.263/4 or MPEG-2. Not true 4K, but more of the original detail intact than using older codecs. Incidentally, the Super Bowl in pseudo 4K was better than 1080p but worse than native 4K. 
CBS has the rights to the Super Bowl, not their streaming provider Paramount +. I think if you have Paramount+ directly through them on their app you will have access to the 4K stream (which will be an up-converted 1080p signal). I don't know if the aggregators (Apple or Amazon) of Paramount+ will provide that feed or not. My guess is likely not. 
Had that happen as well. I had to click down and go through a list below the video to the Super Bowl despite clicking on the Super Bowl on the main screen. I kept having to go back to the app because the audio was off sync On my Roku ultra. I used paramount for years with no issues but I never really watched live stuff. 
I want to watch Paramount Plus and Showtime via the apps. I have Entertainment Plus as an add-on To my YouTube TV account which includes Max, Starz and now “Paramount Plus with Showtime.” I used to be able to watch it through Showtime Anywhere app signing in with YTTV as my provider. 
See, this is what I mean, though. You have to have money riding on football to have any reason to care. Without betting, it's four hours of commercials that are occationally interrupted by a play followed by a bunch of irrelevant comentary. 
Clear your cache. If you stream a lot of shows in a row, you gotta go into the app and clear the cache. I use a firestick for streaming. If it starts playing commercials I exit, go to settings, applications, manage applications, scroll down to paramount and choose clear cache. 
Found a better article. "For the first time, the broadcast network is producing the game, as well as pregame, halftime and postgame show, in the 1080p HDR (high dynamic range) format, which it will stream on Paramount+, CBS.com and the CBS Sports apps (CBS will also provide a 1080p feed to the NFL+ mobile platform)." 
The Superbowl is streaming in the US on paramount plus, where you can get a free 7 day trial so if they use a method to pretend to be American they can watch on there for free. Reply reply SnooGoats6136 
Yep my friend works at paramount+ and has a complementary sub that I am using and the app doesnt work. I have like fire stick 4k max and android tv gives the same issue on both and he says paramount+ is working on that for months now and didnt fix it. </p>
