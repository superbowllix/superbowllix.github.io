        <p>Jared Goff has not won a Super Bowl as of November 2024. American football quarterback Jared Goff is a signal caller for the Detroit Lions. He was born in Novato, California, on October 14, 1994. 
The following year, Goff led the Rams to Super Bowl LIII. He received Pro Bowl honors in both seasons. In 2021, Goff was traded from the Rams to the Lions. In his third year with Detroit, he led the Lions to their first playoff win since 1991, and advanced to the NFC Championship Game. Goff earned Pro Bowl honors again in 2022 and 2024. 
Super Bowl LIII cannot be described as anything other than a massive disappointment for the Los Angeles Rams.L.A. was the league's second highest-scoring team during the regular season, scoring 32  
Jared Goff’s Super Bowl Appearance. Goff has never won a Super Bowl. However, he was the Rams’ starting QB when they lost to the New England Patriots 13-3 in Super Bowl LIII. That was Goff’s solo appearance in the showpiece game, and it resulted in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in NFL history. Goff completed 19 of his 38 pass attempts (50  
Jared Goff, the American football quarterback, has had a remarkable career in the NFL, with notable achievements and challenges, including his Super Bowl journey.

Has Jared Goff Played in a Super Bowl? Yes, Jared Goff has played in a Super Bowl. In 2019, he led the Los Angeles Rams to Super Bowl LIII, where they faced the New England Patriots. Although the Rams lost the game 13-3, Goff's performance was commendable, and he gained valuable experience on the biggest stage in football. 
Jared Goff has played in 1 game in Super Bowls in his career. 
Jared Goff banged his hands against his helmet. The Patriots defeat the Rams, 13-3, to win the Super Bowl.  But then Brady, 41, the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, showed why he is the  
Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff and his wife, model Christen Harper, rolled up to the red carpet at NFL Honors on Thursday night and immediately turned heads. As the couple walked on the red  
In a battle between the two hottest offenses in football as well as the MVP and MVP runner-up, the Lions Jared Goff erases the memory of his Super Bowl loss to the Patriots in a memorable shootout  
Goff is three good games away from a Super Bowl victory—but one bad one away from facing those pesky old questions. This is life for an NFL quarterback. Goff embraces all of it. 
Winner: Jared Goff Brian Flores was the author of two of the lowest moments in Goff’s career. The first came in Super Bowl LIII, when Goff led the Rams to just three points and left a number of  
It’s been a great turnaround over the last two seasons with Jared Goff under center. While that is the case, the Lions have reached their ceiling with Goff, and if they want to make it to the Super Bowl a change is needed. When looking at Goff, he has done a good job for the Lions since being traded to the team in 2021. 
After a 1-6 start that 2022 season, Detroit won three straight games going into the Thanksgiving Day Game vs. Buffalo. The Lions lost a close game to the Bills, 28-25, but went on to lose only one more game the rest of the season, finishing 8-2 over their last 10 games. 
Now Goff is one win away from taking the Lions to the Super Bowl. If Goff can do it, he’ll be just the fifth starting quarterback to lead two different franchises to the Super Bowl. The first quarterback to start Super Bowls with two different teams was Craig Morton, who started Super Bowl V with the Cowboys, went to the Giants amid a career  
Currently, PFN’s Playoff Predictor gives the Lions a 99% chance to make the playoffs, with a 67.8% chance to win the NFC North, and a 24.2% to win the Super Bowl (the highest of any team). The Lions lost in the NFC Championship Game last season, but they likely learned a lot from it.

Even then he still put up three points in the Super Bowl. No no, you missed it. The Rams put up 3 points in the Super Bowl. Not Jared Goff. The rams. There’s been 3 total teams to have gone without a touchdown of any kind in the Super Bowl. The 1971 Dolphins, 2018 Rams, and 2020 Chiefs playing Brady and the Bucs. </p>
