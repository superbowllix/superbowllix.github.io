Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
It was cool to see Ben’s progression in those early/early-mid years. As a 22 year old rookie he seemed scared shitless in his first postseason. As a 23 year old sophomore he was comfortable in the postseason, seemed scared shitless in his first Super Bowl. And then at age 26 in year 5, he was comfortable in his second Super Bowl. 
The average age of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is 30.71 years of age. Over the course of NFL history that seems to fit with what one would think of as the prime of a quarterback’s career.

Super Bowl QB Age: The Rarity of Twentysomething QBs. Super Bowl 57 marks only the 12th time the NFL title game has featured two starting QBs in their 20s, accounting for merely 21% of contests. In fact, it happened only twice in the first 29 Super Bowls. 
In 1998, Elway, at the age of 38, coming off of a Super Bowl victory, led his Denver Broncos to a Super Bowl win over the Atlanta Falcons. Elway threw for 336 yards, a touchdown, and won the Super

The Chiefs beat Philadelphia 35-32 in Super Bowl 57 and the 49ers 25-22 in Super Bowl 58. Mahomes is a three-time Super Bowl MVP. Mahomes is a three-time Super Bowl MVP. 
Who is the youngest NFL quarterback to start a Super Bowl. This feat belongs to Marino who led the Dolphins to Super Bowl XIX at 23 years and 127 days old. Marino went 29 of 50 passing for 318  
QBs 25 or younger have only won 6 of the Super Bowls, 10.5%. The age of the QB from the 58 Super Bowl-winning teams has been 30 or younger thirty-two times. They will be again this year, too. Age 26–30 years old: Have won 26 Super Bowls totaling 45.6%. Jalen Hurts is 26, Patrick Mahomes is 29. How does Draft Position Affect a QBs Chances: 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels could join Patrick Mahomes as one of the youngest starting quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl.  Age: 26 years, 5 months, and 29 days old. 
Super Bowl LIX: A Quarterback Clash for the Ages Super Bowl LIX will see a rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. Chiefs' quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, hopes to secure a fourth Super Bowl MVP title, while Eagles' Jalen Hurts seeks redemption after a pivotal mistake in last year's game. 
At Super Bowl 59, Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes hinted he does not plan to retire from the NFL until reaching a certain age, at least. 
Brady could've been on this list three separate times as he has won a Super Bowl at ages 39, 41, and his latest at age 43, making him the oldest player to ever win the Super Bowl. The seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback has racked up more Super Bowl wins than any franchise has in history. 
The only two quarterbacks younger than Purdy to start in the Super Bowl are Dan Marino (23 years, 127 days old for Super Bowl 20) and Ben Roethlisberger (23 years, 340 days old for Super Bowl 40). 
Some of the most notable achievements by Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks include: Most TD Passes in a Super Bowl – Steve Young with 6 TDs in Super Bowl XXIX. Youngest QB to Win – Ben Roethlisberger, at age 23, in Super Bowl XL. Oldest QB to Win – Tom Brady, at age 43, in Super Bowl LV. 
He became the first quarterback since Eli Manning to lead a fourth-quarter comeback in a Conference Championship and a Super Bowl in the same playoff season. [245] He became the first player in NFL history to pass for at least 6,000 yards and 50 touchdowns in the regular season and postseason combined all while leading a team to a Super Bowl  </p>
