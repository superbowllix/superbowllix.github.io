        <p>Jay-Z is the deciding factor in Super Bowl halftime performance. In 2019, Maroon 5 performed the Super Bowl halftime show and fans weren't pleased with the band's selection or performance. The  
Clearly having Jay-Z’s involvement with the league would be helpful. At one point, such a partnership seemed unlikely. On the 2018 song “Apes—,” Jay rapped, “I said no to the Super Bowl/You need me, I don’t need you/Every night we in the endzone/Tell the NFL we in stadiums too.” 
During a press conference that year, Jay-Z said he “didn’t like the process” the NFL used to choose Super Bowl performers. According to him, the league would interview a number of artists  
The Super Bowl Halftime Show is generally the most-watched concert of the year. That hasn’t changed a bit since Jay-Z was added as the NFL’s live music entertainment strategist in 2019. In fact, the last handful of Super Bowl Halftime performances have been some of the best of all time. 
In case you didn't know, Jay-Z — who has never headlined the Super Bowl himself — has previously aired his frustrations with the way the halftime show is organized. Rich Fury / Getty Images Memorably, on his and Beyoncé ’s 2017 track “ Apeshit ,” Jay raps: “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don't need you / Every night we  
Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and Jay-Z have each made their marks on the NFL's Super Bowl halftime show throughout the years. Ahead of Super Bowl 58, here's a look back at the power couple's impact on  
The upcoming Super Bowl is a rematch of two years ago, when the Chiefs edged the Eagles 38-35 in Glendale, Arizona. Last year, Kansas City beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime in Las Vegas. 
As the 2024 Super Bowl marks Roc Nation’s fifth consecutive year being involved with the halftime show, JAY-Z also shared a statement of his own. “Usher is the ultimate artist and showman. 
Rihanna, one of Roc Nation's biggest artists, performed at Super Bowl LVII on Sunday. Roc Nation, Jay-Z's record label, partnered with the NFL in 2019 as music entertainment strategists. 
Although the game is the primary reason for the gathering, the Super Bowl is also home to one of Continue reading Everything We Know About The $25M 5-Year Partnership Jay-Z’s Roc Nation Inked  
Jay-Z's Roc Nation is behind picking the Super Bowl Halftime show performers. This year, Kendrick Lamar will take the stage at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans as the Philadelphia Eagles take on  
Jay-Z (center) and daughters Blue Ivy Carter (left) and Rumi Carter are seen prior to Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on Feb. 11, 2024. 
During a press conference that year, Jay-Z said he “didn’t like the process” the NFL used to choose Super Bowl performers. According to him, the league would interview a number of artists  
On Monday, Sept. 16, Super Bowl halftime producer Jesse Collins detailed how the decision is made to Variety and said that JAY-Z makes the final call. 
Hosting his Club Shay Shay podcast, the NFL star found out that Jay Z was the first to call Usher about performing at the Super Bowl. With the two artists sharing a history, Usher believed Jay Z  
Jay-Z, who is the co-producer of the Super Bowl Halftime Show, purportedly said in a statement, “Kendrick Lamar is truly a once-in-a-generation artist and performer. His deep love for hip-hop and culture informs his artistic vision. 
Jay-Z has dropped news about next year’s Super Bowl halftime performance letting fans know that Roc Nation has teamed up with Pepsi and the NFL to bring Canadian singer The Weeknd to center  
Kendrick Lamar’s first song (“Humble” currently has the best odds at +160) Kendrick Lamar’s last song (“All the Stars” currently has the best odds at +210) Total number of songs (Over/under set at 10.5, according to the number of songs as recorded by setlist.fm) Taylor Swift bets
