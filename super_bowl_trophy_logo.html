The logo was the first of its kind, as no other Super Bowl had involved the Lombardi Trophy in its design. And for the next 10 years, that – like just about everything else – would not change. 
Super Bowl Logo 2020. The Super Bowl 2020 logo stands out from all previous versions. It began a modernized design for the famous sports symbol and launched a new era, presenting the emblem as a dream prize that requires professional growth. This is conveyed primarily by the light shades of the trophy, shining like a polished treasure. 
The Super Bowl is the yearly competition of the National Football League (NFL), highlighting the end of the playing season.

The silver Vince Lombardi Trophy placed between the L and V and SUPER BOWL is written below on a silver bar. Game played at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona on February 12, 2023. 
The Modern-Era Logo. The modern era of the Super Bowl logo started around 2011 when it appeared in a 3D stainless steel image. It highlighted the Vince Lombardi trophy, which was the focal point of the design. 
A massive golden “50” appeared on the 2016 Super Bowl logo (the league wasn’t into “Super Bowl L”), then the NFL switched to the layout it has used ever since, with numerals flanking both sides of the Lombardi Trophy, with a mostly or partially silver design. 
The NFL has unveiled the official logo for Super Bowl LIX, which will take place on February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Super Bowl logos were much cooler when they were unique. Also, after 9/11, I believe, they scrapped the SB 36 logo and went with their best of all.  the Lombardi Trophy is featured prominently
