        <p>Jim Kelly started four Super Bowls without winning any, a record. He's one of eight quarterbacks who have started at least four Super Bowls. Super Bowl wins are often used to determine the greatness of a quarterback. [1] Of the eligible players, only Jim Plunkett has won multiple Super Bowls and not been inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start at quarterback for the team.

Las Vegas Raiders: 1971 - 1979. A true innovator on the field, Ken Stabler's skillful play and unique style of quarterbacking captivated Las Vegas Raiders fans.Initially drafted by the team, he rose to prominent status during the '70s, leading the squad to a Super Bowl XI victory and earning himself MVP honors in 1974. 
James William Plunkett (born December 5, 1947) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons. He achieved his greatest success during his final eight seasons with the Raiders franchise, whom he led to two Super Bowl wins. 
As a starter in Oakland, Stabler was named AFC player of the year in 1974 and 1976, and was the NFL's passing champion in 1976. In January 1977, he guided the Raiders to their first Super Bowl victory, a decisive 32–14 win over the Minnesota Vikings at the Rose Bowl. [20] [21] 
After playoff victories against the Houston Oilers, Cleveland Browns, and San Diego Chargers, the Raiders went to Super Bowl XV, and clinched their second NFL championship in five years with a 27–10 win over the favored Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XV. With the victory, the Raiders became the first ever wild card team to win a Super Bowl  
The first Notre Dame former quarterback to start a Super Bowl (at quarterback) was Daryle Lamonica in Super Bowl II for the Oakland Raiders. Lamonica threw for 208 yards and a pair of touchdowns  
The Raiders came into the game as four-point favorites. However, offensive struggles from the Raiders, and a dominant defensive performance from Tampa throughout much of the game would unravel the juggernaut Raider offense. Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon threw a Super Bowl record five interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns
