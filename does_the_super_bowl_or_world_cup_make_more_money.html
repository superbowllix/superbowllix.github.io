        <h2><strong>does the super bowl or world cup make more money super bowl year by year winners</strong></h2>
        <p>The massive viewership numbers of the World Cup and Super Bowl pad the coffers of FIFA and the NFL respectively. FIFA has turned a profit of nearly $5 billion or more from the last three World Cups. 
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
The 2018 FIFA World Cup final polled a viewership of 1.12 billion viewers while the highest grossing NFL Super Bowl grossed 114 million viewers, more than ten times its size. The 2021 Super Bowl had a revenue of $545m while 2018 FIFA World Cup had a revenue of $5.36 billion. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
Does the Super Bowl generate more money than the World Cup? According to FIFA , the 2022 Qatar tournament generated $6.314 million in rights sales and $929 million in hospitality and ticketing. Al Jazeera revealed that the 2022 Qatar Tournament brought $7.5 billion in revenue, $1 billion more than the 2018 tournament held in Russia. 
Fans participate in everything from office pools to betting on the final score, player performances, and even halftime show outcomes. The Super Bowl is one of the biggest betting events in the United States, with billions of dollars wagered annually. The FIFA World Cup attracts even more diverse betting activity due to its international audience. 
The Super Bowl has become one of the biggest sporting events in the world, with more than 100 million people watching the NFL’s annual championship game every year. Given the Super Bowl’s popularity, it’s unsurprising that it generates a lot of money. 
The NFL made more than double that at $18 billion, despite being dominant in only one country. A Super Bowl ad costs an average of $6 – $7 million for a 30-second slot. Whereas the 2018 World Cup Final sold the same slots for $434,707 on average. 
It should come as no surprise that on the world stage, soccer has become not only the most popular, but the biggest money maker in the sports world. The 2022 World Cup alone generated over $4.7 billion in revenue. Played in over 200 countries around the globe, professional soccer is overseen by The International Federation of Football (FIFA). 
In Canada, 70% of consumers say they watch the Super Bowl at least occasionally, where 38% say they watch every year. Across these three markets, US, UK, and Canada, the majority believe that the Super Bowl is an ‘American Event,’ but that notion is changing. Younger generations are more likely to view the Super Bowl as a "Global Event  
How much does the losing team at Super Bowl LVIII receive? Last year, the Philadelphia Eagles, beaten by the Chiefs, picked up $82,000 per player, which was also a $7,000 increase on the previous  
How much did Michael Jackson get paid for Super Bowl? Although the league does not pay appearance fees for Super Bowl halftime performers, the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to donate $100,000 to the Heal the World Foundation—a charity that was founded by Jackson—as well as allocate commercial time to air an appeal for the foundation’s Heal L.A. campaign, which aimed to provide  
In this video, we're comparing the FIFA World Cup and NFL Super Bowl to determine which event is bigger. From the number of viewers to the prize money, we'll 
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. But it is important to keep in mind that the NFL has 53 players on its roster, while FIFA has 23. 
There’s not much value if a city needs to build a $1 billion stadium to get the Super Bowl. Warm-weather locations obviously stand to make money off of the Super Bowl, as visitors would more likely stay longer than the average 3.9 days and spend more money. 
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
The official Super bowl vs World Cup view totals are in, and they may surprise some of you Futbol does indeed still beat football, but not by as much as FIF 
The Super Bowl, the NFL's Championship game, is the single biggest TV event in the United States.  During the 2014 World Cup final in Brazil, more than one billion people tuned in to see  
I think it is because the two teams that play in the Super Bowl are the "National Football Conference Champions" and the "American Football Conference Champions", so then saying "National Champions" for the Super Bowl might be confusing. I haven't really seen "World Champions" much anyway, "Super Bowl Champs" is much more common. </p>
