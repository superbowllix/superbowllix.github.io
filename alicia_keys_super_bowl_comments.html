Alicia Keys' performance of the Star-Spangled Banner at Super Bowl XLVII has to be listed among the best in the history of the Super Bowl . The gold standard at this point still remains Whitney  
Usher has seen the online frenzy that was sparked by his Super Bowl duet with Alicia Keys, but he appears to be laughing it off. In footage from his recent appearance on radio show ‚ÄúThe Breakfast Club‚Äù that was posted online Monday, the singer addressed some of the criticism he received for this month‚Äôs record-breaking halftime show  
Alicia Keys voice crack. It was a brief but piercing voice crack, and Keys recovered nicely. On one hand, it's not a big flub. Shit like this happens all time in live performance, especially one of the biggest broadcast events in the US, if not the world, which involves a level of stress that most of us will never know. 
Alicia keys will never headline a super bowl. She‚Äôs not relevant and has not had a major hit in years. The nfl picks people who are current and will draw in a broad audience. A random person can‚Äôt name any song she‚Äôs released in the last 8 years besides maybe Girl On Fire. Look at the material 
2013 ‚Äî Alicia Keys performed for Super Bowl 47 in New Orleans (2 minutes and 36 seconds) 2012 ‚Äî Kelly Clarkson performed for Super Bowl 46 in Indianapolis (1 minute and 34 seconds) 2011 ‚Äî Christina Aguilera performed for Super Bowl 45 at Cowboys Stadium in Texas (1 minute and 53 seconds) 
Why is Alicia Keys getting so much flak for her Super Bowl performance? I feel like a lot of people who can‚Äôt sing really are being hard on her. The voice crack wasn‚Äôt that bad to me. Definitely wasn‚Äôt bad enough to have to lower the key. Also assuming that‚Äôs a true grand piano, there‚Äôs no transpose button.
