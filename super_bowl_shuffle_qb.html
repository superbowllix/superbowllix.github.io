        <p>"The Super Bowl Shuffle" is a song performed by the Chicago Bears football team (credited as the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew) in 1985. It was released in December 1985 on Chicago-based Red Label Records and distributed through Capitol Records [2] seven weeks ahead of their win in Super Bowl XX.

I'm not sure there's ever been a more popular Super Bowl team than the 1985 Chicago Bears. Under legendary NFL head coach Mike Ditka and defensive whiz Buddy Ryan, the Chicago Bears football team featured a record-setting defense and an offense led by quarterback Jim McMahon, running back Walter Payton and defensive lineman William Perry, better known as "Refrigerator Perry."

Jim McMahon, the former head-band wearing player known as Mad Mac and the Punky QB, was the rebellious and unapologetically outspoken quarterback of the 1985 Chicago Bears’ Super Bowl team

New England Patriots fans responded with their own video, which was called "New England, the Patriots and We" and credited on MTV to The Soundtrack Studio Singers.The Bears were clearly the dominant team that year and likely headed for the Super Bowl, but no sane individual would have produced a Patriots Super Bowl video mid season, as they were far from the best team in their conference. 
To do the Superbowl Shuffle CHORUS Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh I'm the punky QB Known as McMann When I hit the turf I've got no plan I just throw my body All over the field I can't dance But I can throw the field I motivate the cats I like to tease I play it so cool I aim to please That's why you all got here On the double To  
During Super Bowl XLIV, McMahon joined other members of the 1985 Chicago Bears in resurrecting the Super Bowl Shuffle in a Boost Mobile commercial. [32] In 2010, McMahon became a part owner of the Indoor Football League's Chicago Slaughter. In November 2012, McMahon appeared on an episode of the sitcom The League called "The Tailgate." [33] 
I just get down to The Super Bowl Shuffle. Steve Fuller They say Jimbo is our man. If Jimmy can't do it, I sure can. This is Steve, and it's no wonder I run like lightnin', pass like thunder. So bring on Atlanta, bring on Dallas, This is for Mike and Papa Bear Halas. I'm not here to feather his ruffle, I just came here to do The Super Bowl Shuffle. 
“The Super Bowl Shuffle” is Sergeant Pepper’s compared to the phoned-in “Grabowski Shuffle.” Ditka: We were all kind of stupid back then. That song was the last thing on my mind not only when I did it, but to this day. Breitberg: I didn’t work on those. I left Red Label while “The Super Bowl Shuffle” was a hit.

Chicago was focused—although the focus was on creating a video, “The Super Bowl Shuffle” that would be released soon thereafter. Even though they sacked Marino six times, the fear of the quarterback’s big-play capacity were well-founded. He completed only 14 passes in 27 attempts but they went for 270 yards.

Tomczack was tabbed to start seven games in 1986 while appearing in six others, with varying levels of activity as opposed to using Steve Fuller.

Stephen Ray Fuller (born January 5, 1957) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons. He played college football for the Clemson Tigers, where he was twice named ACC Player of the Year, and was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the first round of the 1979 NFL draft. 
In 1985 McMahon was selected this first and only Pro Bowl after throwing for a career-high 2,392 yards and completing 56.9 percent of his passes. He was the ‘punky QB’ as described in their ‘Super Bowl Shuffle’ video which was widely popular during their run to Super Bowl XX. He was the leader of the best team in the NFL. 
In the 1980's, QB Jim McMahon was the bad boy of the NFL and his team, the Super Bowl winning 1985 Chicago Bears, is widely considered to be one of the best  </p>
