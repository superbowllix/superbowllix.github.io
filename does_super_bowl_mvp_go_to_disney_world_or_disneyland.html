        <p>Players named the MVP of the Super Bowl have for decades proclaimed that they're going to Disneyland or Disney World to celebrate their accomplishment as part of Disney's ad campaign. 
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. 
The beloved tradition dates back to Super Bowl XXI in 1987, according to Disney Parks Blog.As ESPN also reports, New York Giants quarterback and MVP Phil Simms was the first to shout the now  
Players now are also part of a parade at Disneyland or Disney World. The phrase has been uttered by the game’s MVP or a significant contributor to the win every year since except for Super Bowl  
And every year, the Super Bowl MVP does actually go to Disneyland in California, or another of Disney’s resorts, taking part in a parade in their honour a day after lofting the Lombardi. Watch Super Bowl LIX live on DAZN for just £0.99p 
The Super Bowl Disney World trip is a decades-long NFL tradition. Since 1987, Super Bowl MVPs have been treated to a trip to "The Happiest Place on Earth. 
Which players normally go to Disney World after the Super Bowl? Usually, the ‘MVP’ winner visits Disney World after the game, normally with a teammate and their families, which Mahomes has  
Since Simms became the first Super Bowl MVP to go to Disney in 1987,  The day after the Super Bowl, the chosen player usually takes part in a parade at either Disneyland or Disney World. 
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. The most recent exception was in 2017, when Brady won his fourth of a record-setting five Super Bowl MVP trophies .

The catch phrase “I’m going to Disney World” first attached to the Super Bowl MVP in 1987, after Phil Simms won the award after his Giants beat the Broncos. Ten years ago, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (pictured) pulled the Disney duty by winning the Super Bowl XLV MVP award. This year, the Super Bowl MVP will not be going to Disney

In 1987, Phil Simms, a former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, was featured in the first Disney post-Super Bowl ad exclaiming that he planned to go to Disneyland following his team  
The most recent player to participate with an “I'm Going to Disneyland” statement was MVP Patrick Mahomes after the 2024 Chiefs' Super Bowl victory. In addition to getting paid for the commercial, the MVP enjoys the celebratory parade and a VIP tour with their family the following day at either Disneyland or Disney World whichever is closest. 
With the Super Bowl only a few days away, let's chat about what we know, what's still up in the air, and what you can expect for your trip next week. At this time, we still don't know if the winning team of this year's Super Bowl will be visiting Walt Disney World or Disneyland for the parade of MVPs. 
Unfortunately, we might have to wait until the iconic commercial airs to find out whether the Super Bowl MVP will visit the Disneyland Resort or the Walt Disney World Resort. Because the 2024 Super Bowl will be played in Las Vegas, I think it's likely that the MVP might visit Disneyland Park given that it is so closely located. I recommend

Each year after the game, there is a famous commercial where the MVP of the winning team looks into the camera and says that they're going to Disneyland or Disney World, then typically makes an appearance in the park closest to where the game is held the next day. 
Super Bowl LIV MVP Patrick Mahomes in the parade at the Magic Kingdom the day after the game "I'm going to Disney World!" and "I'm going to Disneyland!" are advertising slogans used in a series of television commercials by The Walt Disney Company that began airing in 1987. [1] 
Walt Disney World has announced that they will host the Super Bowl LIX parade this year on Monday, February 10, 2025. It traditionally features the Big Game’s MVP, as well as the quarterback of the winning team, and other key players. 
However, with this year’s game in New Orleans, the pendulum seems poised to swing back to Walt Disney World in Florida. If the winning team does head to Walt Disney World, fans can expect a magical celebration on Main Street, U.S.A., featuring the Super Bowl MVP waving to crowds, perhaps joined by a few teammates. </p>
