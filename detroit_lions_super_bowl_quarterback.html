        <h2><strong>detroit lions super bowl quarterback eagles vs chiefs in super bowl</strong></h2>
        <p>Jared Thomas Goff [2] (born October 14, 1994) is an American professional football quarterback for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the California Golden Bears, setting Pac-12 Conference single-season records for passing yards and passing touchdowns. 
These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start at quarterback for the Lions. Since the beginning of the 2021 season, their starting quarterback has been Jared Goff. 
After a 1-6 start that 2022 season, Detroit won three straight games going into the Thanksgiving Day Game vs. Buffalo. The Lions lost a close game to the Bills, 28-25, but went on to lose only one more game the rest of the season, finishing 8-2 over their last 10 games. 
This also remains as the Lions' fourth and most recent league title and most recent championship appearance (including the Super Bowl) as of 2024, starting a sixty-seven year championship drought for the Lions, which is currently the fourth-longest championship drought in the four major North American sports leagues. [13] 
Despite all the injuries, Lions have legitimate shot to win Super Bowl. Vito Chirco | Jan 12, 2025. Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff (16) talks to head coach Dan Campbell before a play against  
ALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) — After getting long-term security with a $212 million contract extension, Lions quarterback Jared Goff said he has one more thing to accomplish with Detroit. Win the franchise’s first Super Bowl. A few minutes after signing the four-year deal on Thursday that will take him through the 2028 season, the Lions  
During his time in Los Angeles, he earned two Pro Bowl berths, guided the Rams to two NFC West division titles and three playoff appearances and led the team to Super Bowl LIII. Goff comes to Detroit after spending the first five seasons of his career (2016-20) with the Rams, who selected him with the first overall pick of the 2016 NFL Draft  
Here is the full list of starting quarterbacks the Detroit Lions have had in their history (starting as the Portsmouth Spartans from 1930-1933 of course). Notes: The number of starts is regular  
The Lions have gotten better and better with each passing year, going from a feisty 3-13-1 team in 2021 to a legitimate Super Bowl contender. GO DEEPER Detroit Lions 2024 schedule: Take care of  
A common sentiment this Monday is that the Lions' Super Bowl hopes have officially been dashed, and it's probably an appropriate reaction.  Goff is a also better quarterback now than he was in  
The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX. 
While the Lions prepare for the offseason, the final game of the 2024-25 NFL season is set for Sunday, February 9, marking Super Bowl 2025 with the Kansas City Chiefs against the Philadelphia  
The Detroit Lions' playoff run came to a heartbreaking end in the Divisional Round against the Washington Commanders. However, a recent admission by the NFL has reignited frustration for Lions fans, as it has been revealed that a missed penalty may have been a key turning point in the game that ultimately led to their loss. 
Although the Lions don’t have a Super Bowl appearance, it doesn’t mean they haven’t had some high-performance quarterbacks in the Motor City. Perhaps their current QB can help the Lions break that Super Bowl drought. Start your engines as we speed to the Motor City and fuel up on the top quarterbacks of all time for the Detroit Lions. 
An early Super Bowl prediction. I had the Lions winning the NFC and facing the Kansas City Chiefs in my preseason Super Bowl prediction, and I don’t see much reason to change that now. The Lions are the best team in the NFC and they have the best non-weather-related homefield advantage in all of football.

Free Press sports writer Dave Birkett highlights the best and worst performances of the Detroit Lions’ 48-42 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday at Ford Field.. The Lions (12-2) lost for the first time in exactly three months — when they also lost at home to Tampa Bay, 20-16, in Week 2 on Sept. 15 — and had their franchise-record 11-game win streak snapped. 
The Detroit Lions' history is surprisingly light on elite quarterback play. The organization has still never won a Super Bowl, leaving a fan base longing for consistent winning. Detroit has had
