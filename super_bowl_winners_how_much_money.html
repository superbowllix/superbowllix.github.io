        <p>Do Winners of the Super Bowl Get Paid Extra? It’s true: Winners of every Super Bowl also make an extra paycheck and receive a unique ring for that game. In terms of the paycheck, it’s substantial. The winner of Super Bowl LIX will receive a bonus worth $171,000. The loser will receive $96,000. 
How much money will the Super Bowl winners and losers get? The most recent collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and the NFL was struck in 2020. It states that each member of the winning team will receive $171,000 for winning the 2025 Super Bowl.

How much do Super Bowl winners get paid?  Thanks to the collective bargaining agreement, the prize money for Super Bowl winners increases every season. It was $157,000 in 2022, $164,000 in 2023  
Back in the first Super Bowl, the winner was paid $15,000, and the loser $7,500. However, when adjusted for inflation, that equates to roughly $117,000 and $59,000 in 2022. Therefore, the change in pay for playing in or winning the Super Bowl has not increased so substantially over the years relative to the current market. 
How Much Do Players Get Paid For Winning The Super Bowl? Each player on the winning side of Super Bowl LIV will take home $171,000, according to Article 37 in the NFL collective bargaining agreement. This is $7,000 more per player than last year, where eligible players from the winning team each received $164,000. 
The bonus associated with playing in the Super Bowl grows each year, according to the agreement. Last year the winners’ bonus was $157,000. Next year, it’s set to rise to $171,000. By the 2030-31 football season (the last seasons covered in the most recent bargaining agreement), the Super Bowl winners will each take home an extra $228,000. 
Here's a look at how much money Super Bowl 57 (LVII) players get paid as a bonus as the winner of the Super Bowl in 2023. 
The 2023 Super Bowl winners earned $164,000, while members of the winning team in 2022 received $157,000—so you can see it goes up a bit each year. This year's cash bonus is up more than $40,000 from 2020, when the winners of the Super Bowl each took home $130,000.

As in the Pro Bowl Games, Super Bowl LVIII includes a monetary incentive to win, although the $171,000 for winners and $96,000 for losers is a departure from the NFL’s usual twice-as-much payday  
For the 49ers, they will still get bonus checks for participating in the game, with each player taking home $89,000. Players also receive bonuses for each successive round of the playoffs they win
