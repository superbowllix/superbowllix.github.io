        <p>In the last 10 years, the only teams to win a championship wearing a different color were the teams competing in this year's Super Bowl: the Eagles (in Super Bowl 52) and the Chiefs (in Super  
Kansas City beat the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, last year in this game while wearing red. The team was also wearing red for Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid's first Super Bowl victory together in  
It's been historically ideal to wear white in the Super Bowl. Teams wearing white have won 37 of the 58 Super Bowls, which is good for a 63.8% win rate. Since 2000, 18 of 25 winners (72.0%) have been wearing white jerseys. If you're a believer in the trend, that edge belongs to the Chiefs in 2025. It doesn't stop there. 
At Super Bowl LIX, the Eagles are designated as the home team against the Chiefs so they got to chose which jerseys to wear. The AFC and NFC alternate as the home team each year, with the NFC the  
The Eagles, who wore green during their 2022 Super Bowl loss to the Chiefs, are 1-2 wearing their home colors in the big game since Jeffrey Lurie took ownership of the team in 1994; Philadelphia  
From a broader standpoint, the team wearing white jerseys has almost a 2:1 winning advantage over teams wearing non-white jerseys in the Super Bowl. Those wearing white jerseys have won 37 of the  
The Birds are 1-2 in the big game wearing their home colors, including their narrow loss to the Chiefs in 2023. However, the franchise’s only Super Bowl victory came while decked out in midnight green against Tom Brady (who will be calling the game this year for Fox) and the New England Patriots in 2018. 
The Eagles and Chiefs have been part of an anomaly, as both teams wore different colors in recent Super Bowls but emerged victorious—Philadelphia in Super Bowl 52 and Kansas City in Super Bowls  
The only teams to win the Super Bowl in the last decade wearing a color other than white are the Chiefs - who wore red in SB LIV and LVIII - and Eagles - who wore green in SB LII.   
Meanwhile, Philadelphia won its only Super Bowl in franchise history dawning green uniforms in its 2018 Super Bowl win versus Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. Teams wearing white jerseys have won 64% of the time in the Super Bowl, including 16 of the last 20 overall. They’ve also covered the spread 14 times during that span. 
With the Super Bowl 59 matchup set between the Chiefs and Eagles, the two teams revealed their uniforms for Feb. 9’s game in New Orleans. Given that the Eagles are the designated home team, many  
Kansas City beat the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, last year in this game while wearing red.The team was also wearing red for Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid's first Super Bowl victory together in  
To further dispel the conspiracy theory, the Super Bowl logos are planned out at least two and a half years in advance, making it impossible to be able to predict the two teams competing. 
The Super Bowl, which was first played in 1967, has seen a wide range of colors worn by the participating teams over the years. Early Years: The Dominance of Primary Colors. In the early years of the Super Bowl, teams tended to stick to primary colors such as red, blue, and yellow. 
The Super Bowl is headed to New Orleans in 2025  and here are the colors for you conspiracy theorists  was red on the logo and both the Chiefs and 49ers wear red, which means both teams were  
Teams wearing white jerseys in the Super Bowl are 16-4 in the last 20 title games. The only two teams to win wearing home colors over the last decade are  the Chiefs and the Eagles. 
• Overall, teams wearing white jerseys have a 7-3 record in New Orleans Super Bowls (2-1 at Tulane, 5-2 at the Superdome). Among primary colors, “green teams” are 1-1, both in green jerseys, both at the Superdome; “red teams” are 2-2, 1-2 at the Superdome (1-0 in white jerseys and 0-2 in red jerseys). 
However, they will not be wearing them in the Super Bowl as the league's strict uniform policy forbids anything other than Primary Jersey color. Is there a Super Bowl jersey curse? Apparently so - and it could be bad news for the Philadelphia Eagles. Teams wearing white are an incredible 16-4 in the past 20 Super Bowls and 37-21 (64%) overall. 
Those colors do match the colors of the teams playing the Super Bowl: the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.  When is the Super Bowl 2025? The Super Bowl will be played on Sunday
