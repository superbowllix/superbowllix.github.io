        <p>For example, as Natasha Crain says, “The fact that Jesus ‘gets us,’ stripped from the context of His identity, is meaningless.” The spending on the ad campaign has also been called into question. He Gets Us spent $20 million on the Super Bowl ads alone. The group has said the goal is to invest about a billion dollars over the next three  
Viewers who watched Super Bowl 58 took note of a commercial with this tagline: "He Gets Us." This year, the ad campaign will run a 60-second commercial during the first half of the big game. What  
But in this scenario, "He" is the center of a marketing campaign that has spread far across the U.S., spanning between billboards, banner ads online, and a forthcoming Super Bowl commercial. 
In between star-studded advertisements and a whole lot of football, this year’s Super Bowl watchers are being taken to church. “He Gets Us,” a campaign to promote Jesus and Christianity, is  
During Super Bowl Sunday, a 60-second ad aired about Jesus Christ, and no one seemed angrier about it than Christians. The ad depicts a series of images of one person washing another person’s  
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Who Is My Neighbor,” the 15-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” 
That's a tagline that's been popping up in banner ads online, on highway billboards and soon in Super Bowl commercials. The he is Jesus Christ. And the ads say things like Jesus was a refugee and  
The He Gets Us ads running during the Super Bowl, the most watched U.S. event of the year, were created by a nondenominational group to share the message of Christ’s love to whole new audiences. 
The "He Gets Us" campaign is spending millions of dollars on its Super Bowls ads to promote Jesus. NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Josiah Daniels about the campaign and its purpose. 
As of Friday, Jan. 20, “He Gets Us” ads aired during the NFL playoffs had generated more than 166 million impressions, according to company data that was shared with me. A Religion News Service report on the campaign from October said that the “He Gets Us” team launched with a $100 million budget. 
He Gets Us, a $100 million campaign reimagining Jesus’ message, is airing a 60-second “True Greatness” spot at Super Bowl 2025. Learn how the nonprofit Come Near, Jon Batiste’s Love Riot Festival, and AI-driven art are shaping this year’s faith-based outreach. 
The "He Gets Us" Christian ad campaign made waves during the 2024 Super Bowl game. A spokesperson for the brand explained their message and respond to critics. 
Step into the captivating world of faith and advertising with Talbot Dean Ed Stetzer in this Think Biblically podcast episode. Explore the groundbreaking &amp;quot;He Gets Us&amp;quot; campaign, a visionary effort by Christian business leaders and marketing experts to reshape contemporary views of Jesus, fostering curiosity and dialogue among skeptics 
I bring all this up because I recognized the same seeker-friendly tactics in Sunday’s “He Gets Us” Super Bowl ads that I experienced at my first evangelical church, and in others that followed. 
Major media outlets are covering the ad campaign, too. Yahoo’s reprint of a Parade article headlined “‘He Gets Us’ Super Bowl Ads for Jesus Flagged by Fans Criticizing Company Funding Them  
"He Gets Us" has purchased advertising during sporting events, including in-venue sponsor placements, as well as television commercials; three separate ads ran during the 2022–23 NFL playoffs, and the campaign purchased two spots during Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023. 
Once again, Super Bowl commercials from the “He Gets Us” campaign polarized viewers tuning into the Big Game on Sunday night. 
The “He Gets Us” ad campaign, in its second year running ads for the big game, has a simple goal, on the surface: It’s about getting Christians and non-Christians alike to think about how to
