        <h2><strong>joe namath is the only super bowl mvp quarterback who did not super bowl mvps ranked</strong></h2>
        <p>Namath was the Super Bowl MVP, completing eight passes to George Sauer Jr. alone for 133 yards. The win made him the first quarterback to start and win a national championship game in college, a major professional league championship, and a Super Bowl. The Jets' win gave the AFL instant legitimacy even to skeptics. 
The guarantee did happen. The New York Jets did win Super Bowl III, 16-7, and Joe Namath was named the MVP. However, he didn’t throw one touchdown pass in the game. Yes, he did outplay the great Johnny Unitas, who only threw for 110 yards as the New York defense shut him down. 
Through the first 34 Super Bowls, 18 quarterbacks have been named Super Bowl MVPs, but Namath is the only one to win the award without passing for at least one touchdown. As Sample says, "Everything that happened that day revolved around Joe." Indeed, everything about that game still revolves around Joe. It was his stage, his moment. 
The only reason the MVP did not go to the winning quarterback in Super Bowl 5 was that Earl Morrall, who replaced an injured Johnny Unitas, only completed 7 of 15 passes for 147 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. There is also something else to remember about Namath’s performance in that Super Bowl game. Namath called his own plays. 
Joe Namath, meanwhile, won the Super Bowl MVP award, more for his masterful game management than passing skills. Namath, in fact, did not throw a scoring touchdown all day, though he did use his passing talents strategically, completing 17 out of 28 passes for 206 yards and no interceptions. And it wasn’t just Joe Namath, of course. 
To this day, Namath is the only quarterback to win Super Bowl MVP without throwing a touchdown pass. He also registered 28 attempts without an interception, also an NFL record. Namath left the field after a dominant 16-7 victory the way he entered it: with confidence. 
The Game did not become The Event until Namath led the New York Jets to a 16-7 upset of the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Broadway Joe, the roguish quarterback whose talent was exceeded only by his swagger, brought some welcome spice to the championship game. Millions flocked to their television sets to watch. Thirty years later, they  
Joe Namath was seen as the rebel quarterback from the rebel league battling the established NFL. It was perfect for the 1960s, turning the Jets quarterback into a counterculture icon. With Joe Namath’s guarantee drawing in more fans, the Super Bowl kicked off at 3:00 to see if the brash young man could be humbled or show the old guard there  
Namath started at quarterback. He completed 19 of 49 passes for 266 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. He also had one rush for 14 yards. Super Bowls. Super Bowl III – New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7 Namath started at quarterback. He completed 17 of 28 passes for 206 yards. He was named the game’s Most Valuable Player. 
4. Zero fourth-quarter passes For the first three quarters of Super Bowl III, Namath completed 17 of 28 passes for 206 yards. Namath did not attempt a single pass during the fourth quarter, a fact  
Namath led the New York Jets to a 16-7 upset against the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III after "The Guarantee." That helped legitimize the AFL-NFL merger, and it made Namath one of the most  
Even though Oakland quarterback Daryle Lamonica threw for 401 yards, the Jets won the rematch 27-23 behind Namath's three touchdown passes to capture the AFL's spot in the Super Bowl. 
The recruitment of high school athletes in the early 1960s was much different than these days. Legendary Alabama coach Paul “Bear” Bryant was alerted to Namath’s status after he had graduated from high school, and he sent one of his young assistant coaches, Howard Schnellenberger, to Beaver Falls with instructions to “not come back without him.” 
Experts didn't give the New York Jets much of a chance of winning Super Bowl III in 1969, but Joe Namath and the rest of the Jets players proved them wrong. 
Joe Namath is a Hall of Famer and a Super Bowl MVP winner, so his credentials are about as good as it gets. However, per Bleacher Report, he’s the only quarterback to have won a Super Bowl MVP award despite not throwing for a single touchdown in the game. 
Joe Namath – 206 passing yards at Super Bowl III (1969) Compared to some of the other players on this list, Joe Namath’s 206 passing yards and no touchdowns in Super Bowl III isn’t very  
It was a different game back then. Joe threw the ball downfield on almost every attempt. Having said that, Joe is in Canton mainly due to the Super Bowl win. His career was not great, and he was hurt much of the time. He only played a full season twice after 1969. 
52 years ago today, Joe Namath made good on his guarantee as the Jets beat the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. (via NFL) 
After boldly guaranteeing a victory prior to the game, Jets quarterback Joe Namath completed 17 out of 28 passes for 206 yards and was named the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player. However, he did  
Days earlier, Jets quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed a victory by New York, an 18-point underdog. The win was the first in the Super Bowl for the AFL, which merged with the NFL for the 1970 season. </p>
