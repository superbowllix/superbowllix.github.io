The Eagles won't have a winning record The Eagles won't be relevant in the playoff picture The Eagles won't make the playoffs The Eagles won't win the division The Eagles won't have a first round BYE The Eagles won't be the first seed The Eagles won't win any playoff games The Eagles won't make it to the Super Bowl 
They believed the Patriots had gotten away with countless cheap shots on quarterback Donovan McNabb in their 24-21 win over the Eagles in the Super Bowl, and now they had the video to prove it. "At first, he didn't take us seriously," recalled John Harbaugh, then the Eagles' special teams coach and now head coach of the Ravens. 
Entering Super Bowl 59 this year, Philadelphia has been to four NFL title games and holds a 1-3 record in Super Bowl matchups. The Eagles lost in each of their first two Super Bowl appearances. 
The Eagles have just one Super Bowl win, where they bested the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII (2018). Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl history: Super Bowl 1981: 27-10 loss to the  
The Eagles will look to become the 15th franchise in NFL history to win multiple Lombardi Trophies as they face the Chiefs in Super Bowl 59. Eagles Super Bowl record The Eagles have a 1-3 record  
The Chiefs get more Mahomes magic and advance to 3rd straight Super Bowl, beating the Bills 32-29; Hurts, Barkley each rush for 3 TDs to help Eagles reach Super Bowl with 55-23 win over Commanders; Taylor Swift watches boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Chiefs beat the Bills and get back to Super Bowl 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
Last season’s follow-up to the Super Bowl appearance was disappointing. The Eagles began 10-1 but came undone and were eliminated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round of the playoffs. 
The Philadelphia Eagles put on an offensive clinic in the NFC Championship, routing the Washington Commanders 55-23 to secure their spot in the Super Bowl. This dominating performance was not just  
A bunch of analysts making predictions, media making predictions, Eagles fans on this win streak, obviously enough people on Reddit. Not you though. Instead you are so against thinking about the Eagles in the Superbowl, you join threads about Eagles in the Superbowl and have to try tearing it down. 
Purdy's contract really saves the day for the Niners. Not having to pay a QB really allows them to have a lot of talent all over the place. Look at the AFC teams, where Mahomes would love to have a pricey hired gun at WR that he could rely on, or how the Ravens are getting insane value of a bunch of lower-cost older guys in edge role rather than a monster edge rusher who would command big money. 
Philadelphia, which joined Kansas City as the only 14-win teams in the NFL this season, is set to appear in its fourth ever Super Bowl, having previously done so in 1980, 2004 and 2017 (Eagles defeated New England, 41-33, in Super Bowl LII). Overall, Super Bowl LVII marks the franchise’s eighth NFL title game (also 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1960).

Confidence: Low - In three previous Super Bowl appearances, Mahomes has a 61.8% completion with five TDs and four INTs. He was clutch in the Super Bowl victories against the Niners and Eagles. Kelce has 23 receptions on 27 targets with 257 yards and three TDs in the playoffs, and that is going to be the key matchup against Warner and Greenlaw.

Might win both, but there’s a lot of curses to broke here. He already broke the 0-3 burrow head curse. Now: no passing leader has EVER won the Super Bowl. 24(?) years since a player won NFL MVP AND Super Bowl. And PMJ is like 0-5 with Carl Cheffers as ref. Steelers are like 1-6 with him as ref, only win being against KC.
