        <p>The most-watched Super Bowl of all time came in 2024. Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles had more than 123.7 million total average viewers. Streaming numbers from Paramount+ were added to the viewership numbers, which helped push the game past 123 million. 
I used average viewership data from Wild Card Round, Divisional Round, Conference Championship, and Super Bowl games played between 2021 and 2025 (representing the 2020-2024 regular seasons) to  
The last two Super Bowl's have set audience records, averaging 123.7 million viewers last year. This season NFL regular season and postseaon ratings have dropped 
That includes a projected 150,000 visitors who are forecast to spend $215 million on food and beverages, hotels, Super Bowl merch, and more. It’s the latest in a string of big events for Las Vegas. 
Last year’s Super Bowl drew 115.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched U.S. telecast in history. But 2024’s big game may bring in even bigger numbers. New Morning Consult data shows that 73% of U.S. adults said they will likely watch the big game — which takes place on February 11th at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco  
Sunday's Super Bowl is expected to shatter viewership records in the U.S. and with an assist from the federal government, could be the most watched NFL game ever around the world. 
The only exceptions are Super Bowl 55 in 2021, which an estimated 95.9 million people tuned in for, and Super Bowl 53 in 2019, which recorded nearly 99 million estimated viewers. 
—The annual Adtaxi Super Bowl Viewership survey highlights both the ongoing shift towards streaming media and the potential impact of Taylor Swift on the game’s audience. For Super Bowl LXVII, the Adtaxi survey found that audiences will rely heavily on digital services, with more than one third (36%) of those surveyed saying they plan to  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
Super Bowl LIX. The latest consumer spending data from NRF and Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics’ 2025 Super Bowl Spending Survey found that a record 203.4 million U.S. adults plan to tune in to the big game. This year, 113.7 million people plan to throw or attend a party, and another 17.6 million plan to watch the game at a bar or restaurant. 
For the 2024 Super Bowl, Nielsen said there was a record 123.7 million viewers a year ago and older average-minute viewers on CBS, Univision, Nickelodeon, Paramount+ and other digital services. 
Super Bowl LIX is projected to attract over 120 million viewers, many of whom are eager to see the latest ads from top brands. In the Pringles spot, named "The Call of the Mustaches," Reid is humorously depicted alongside other celebrities. 
Total spending on food, drinks, apparel, decorations, and other purchases for Super Bowl Sunday celebrations is expected to reach $16.5 billion, or $85.36 for each of the 192.9 million adults  
Over 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all-or-part of Super Bowl LVIII across all networks, the highest unduplicated total audience to date and up +10% from Super Bowl XLII (183.6 million). 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl — and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Super Bowl advertisers paid up to $8 million to secure a spot in television's most watched broadcast. Here's a lineup by product category of the commercials that will run. 
More than 450 million viewers watched the 2023 UEFA Champions League Final; The Super Bowl LVII Between Eagles and Chiefs was the most viewed sporting event in 2023; More than 57 million viewers in the US watched digital live sports content at least once per month; An Average of 11.64 million viewers in the United States watched the 2023 NBA Finals 
One of the Super Bowl score projections is from Mike Tierney, who is 61-39-3 (+1787) on NFL against the spread picks this season. Tierney is backing the Eagles to beat the Chiefs, 30-20, in a  </p>
