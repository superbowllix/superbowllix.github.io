        <p>The Chiefs planned on doing that in Super Bowl 58, as Chris Jones explained after Kansas City's win. "We talked through this for two weeks," Jones told The Ringer of the Chiefs' overtime strategy.

The Chiefs wanted the ball second in overtime in the Super Bowl. The 49ers wanted the ball first -- and got it.  Make no mistake: Getting the ball third is an enormous advantage if a team can  
Super Bowl 58 went to overtime between the Chiefs and 49ers, and after San Francisco kicked a field goal with 7:22 left in the first overtime, the Chiefs drove down to the 49ers' three-yard line  
The Super Bowl marked the first game ever under the new postseason overtime rules that were implemented in 2022 and under those rules, both teams are guaranteed at least one possession. 
Although the Kansas City Chiefs have been praised for winning Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, the San Francisco 49ers have been almost equally blamed for a critical mistake they made in the loss  
Las Vegas. The ball rested at the Chiefs‚Äô 34-yard line, an overtime scoreboard displaying a three-point deficit, with Kansas City facing fourth down and 1 yard to go in Super Bowl LVIII. 
Though another, unnamed former head coach called it a ‚ÄúBIG mistake‚Äù in a text to a writer for The Athletic, receiving the ball at the start of overtime and putting points on the board puts more pressure on the opposing team‚Äôs offense. Just because it didn‚Äôt work out (again) for the 49ers against the Chiefs in the Super Bowl doesn‚Äôt  
ESPN's Dan Orlovsky seems to believe the 49ers made a potentially game-altering mistake to begin the overtime period in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday.. San Francisco, who won the toss and elected to  
The 49ers‚Äô loss came in just the second overtime Super Bowl period in NFL history. Before San Francisco gave up a game-winning touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Mecole Hardman, head coach  
The Chiefs took over at their own 25-yard line with 1:53 remaining following Jake Moody‚Äôs go-ahead field goal. On the first play of the drive, Patrick Mahomes found Travis Kelce for a nine-yard  
Sunday night in Las Vegas brought us not only the second overtime game in Super Bowl history,  You don't want to make the mistake of taking league-wide numbers and blindly applying them to your  
Super Bowl LVIII ended with the Kansas City Chiefs hoisting the Lombardi Trophy for the third time in a five-year span. Patrick Mahomes is inevitable and the Chiefs are officially a dynasty with

Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 on Sunday, becoming the NFL's ninth repeat Super Bowl champs. 
It was only the second overtime game in Super Bowl history ‚Äî the first being the aforementioned Patriots-Falcons game seven years ago.  Democrats need to avoid making last year‚Äôs mistakes  
Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones had this to say about San Francisco 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan‚Äôs pivotal decision in the Super Bowl. With the game tied at 19 and heading to overtime, Shanahan chose to take the ball after the 49ers won the coin toss. 
The 49ers made some critical mistakes and failed to take advantage of numerous opportunities to take control. They left Patrick Mahomes with enough of an opening for him to make the big plays when needed for a 25-22 overtime victory in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday at Allegiant Stadium. 
I'd bet money that most of the players don't know what the Super Bowl overtime rules are. ‚Äî Jimmy Traina (@JimmyTraina) February 12, 2024 It seems that Kansas City Chiefs players knew the rules.
