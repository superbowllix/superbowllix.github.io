        <p>This part of the 2025 Super Bowl logo is the most prominent because the vividly painted Roman numerals “LIX” occupy most of the space. Between them, just after the “L,” stands the silver Vince Lombardi Trophy—a football, rising on a vertical pedestal with a heraldic shield and the “NFL” inscription. 
Super Bowl LIX will feature a logo created by a local New Orleans artist, a first for the NFL, and how that affects how much Super Bowl merchandise is set to go for during the Big Game 
This year, for Super Bowl LIX, the logo has a similar layout to the one the NFL has used since 2017: A silver Lombardi Trophy runs through the middle of the Roman numerals, all of which sit atop a horizontal bar reading “Super Bowl.” But as the Big Game returns to New Orleans, the logo is also markedly different. 
The Super Bowl LIX logo got some NOLA inspiration and made history in the process. The NFL collaborated with Tahj Williams , a local artist who is the queen of her Black Masking Indian tribe in  
Months before the Chiefs and Eagles earned a ticket to Super Bowl LIX, the NFL design team asked Tajh to create both theme art and the logo for Super Bowl 59. “I like to make a funny joke that the NFL slid into my DMs,” explained Queen Tahj.

That conspiracy theory halted this year, though. Super Bowl LVIII's logo was predominantly red and purple, leading many to believe that the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens would meet up

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Artist Tahj “Queen Tahj” Williams rarely cruises through downtown New Orleans, but recently she did, finding one of her creations on full display: The Super Bowl logo and  
What does the Super Bowl LIX logo represent? This year’s game will be played in New Orleans, which prompted the NFL to partner with a local artist for the first time when designing the logo. 
In 2023, a placeholder logo was introduced for early promotion of the event. On February 12, 2024, one day after Super Bowl LVIII, the National Football League unveiled an official logo for the event.

The Super Bowl is the yearly competition of the National Football League (NFL), highlighting the end of the playing season.
