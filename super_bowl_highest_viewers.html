        <p>Super Bowl X also saw an increase in ratings; total viewership for the 1976 game increased by 2 million compared to the previous year and the national audience share was 78%, which remains the highest-ever number for the game on a single network. 
The game was not close from the start. Despite the massive blowout, this was the fourth most-watched Super Bowl in history. The average viewership number for this Super Bowl was 112,752,000. The air date for Super Bowl XLVIII was on February 2, 2014. 3. Super Bowl XLIX: New England Patriots vs Seattle Seahawks. Super Bowl XLIX was aired on NBC. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers.

That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
Super Bowl LVIII is the most-watched program ever, averaging 123.4 million viewers across all platforms, up +7% versus last year's Super Bowl which was the previous record (115.1 million). More than 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all-or-part of Super Bowl LVIII across all networks, the highest unduplicated total audience in history and up  
Super Bowl television ratings and shares, including network (both NBC and CBS televised the first Super Bowl). The rating represents the percentage of televisions tuned in to a program. The share is the percentage of televisions on at the time that watched: 
Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, was the site of Super Bowl LVIII, the most-watched broadcast in American television history.. The Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969, is reported to have been watched by 125–150 million people. [4]
