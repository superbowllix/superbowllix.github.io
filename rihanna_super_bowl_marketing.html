Savage X, Rihanna’s clothing/lingerie brand, got its own boost during the Super Bowl as the Fenty off-shoot launched a “Game Day Drop” campaign, riding on the heels of the halftime hype, spending $55k, and $3.9M total spend between January 1st and February 20th – a 50% increase from their ad spend during the same time period last year  
The Rihanna Super Bowl show and her Savage-Fenty marketing campaign are two prime examples of how to create an attention-grabbing marketing and sales campaign and stamp your brand in the brains of  
In just a few seconds, Rihanna managed to showcase her Fenty Beauty product, leaving a significant impact and redefining the concept of a cost-effective Super Bowl ad.

The halftime show product placement was a savvy—cheeky even—rebuff of the traditional Super Bowl commercial. The lore of Super Bowl ads is almost as well-known as the game itself—since the 1980s, these commercial spots have been highly sought after, and a 30-second spot reportedly cost participating brands, such as Doritos, Pepsi and Uber  
Super Bowl LVII revealed that a staggering 188.7 million viewers tuned into Rihanna’s halftime show, illustrating that significant attention is given to commercial breaks, attracting roughly one-third of viewers who are primarily interested in the ads and performances.

After her 2023 Super Bowl LVII performance, Rihanna’s music streams spiked 600%, showcasing the event’s influence on the entertainment industry. Takeaways for DECA Members. The Super Bowl teaches important lessons in marketing, money management and planning.
