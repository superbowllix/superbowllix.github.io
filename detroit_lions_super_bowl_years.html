        <h2><strong>detroit lions super bowl years mens super bowl jacket</strong></h2>
        <p>There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
Detroit has never been to a Super Bowl. As a result, their streak is up to 57 years, with a chance to extend to 58 if the team can't take down San Francisco in the 2024 NFC championship game. 
What years did the Lions make the Super Bowl? The Detroit Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl. How many Super Bowls have the Lions won? The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. The closest they came to winning a Super Bowl was in 1991 and 2023 when they lost the Conference Championship. 
Have the Detroit Lions ever played in the Super Bowl or hoisted the Lombardi Trophy? Did they win any NFL Championships prior to the Super Bowl era? The Detroit Lions are one of the oldest franchises in NFL history, as they have been in the league since 1930. 
The Lions have won four NFL championships, all of which pre-date the existence of the Super Bowl. The Lions' four championships are tied for the tenth most total championships amongst all 32 NFL franchises; [ 7 ] the last of these was in 1957, which gives the club the second-longest NFL championship drought behind the Arizona Cardinals . [ 8 ] 
Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
Detroit Lions Playoff History. Team Names: Portsmouth Spartans, Detroit Lions. Seasons: 95 (1930 to 2024) Record (W-L-T): 606-709-34 Playoff Record: 9-15. Super Bowls Won: 0 (0 Appearances) Championships Won *: 4 All-time Passing Leader: Matthew Stafford 3,898/6,224, 45,109 yds, 282 TD All-time Rushing Leader: Barry Sanders 3,062 att, 15,269  
The Lions have not yet reached the Super Bowl, as of December 2024. The Detroit Lions have a playoff record of 9 wins and 14 losses, and they have won four NFL championships. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, the Detroit Lions have won the NFL Championship 4 times, most recently in the 1957 season. A full list of all Detroit Lions championships and championship appearances, along with scores, dates and opponents. 
They won championships in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957, with legends like Bobby Layne and Doak Walker running the show. The 1957 win? They absolutely destroyed the Browns, 59-14. But when the 
In just a few days, the 59th Super Bowl will take place, and for the 59th consecutive time, it will not feature the Detroit Lions.This year, it felt like the Lions may finally break the streak, as  
MIDLAND, Mich. – Jamie Gregory, a devoted Detroit Lions fan from Midland, had a dream shared by many: to see the Lions play in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, that dream didn’t come true. 
The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX. 
Workers hang player banners outside the Caesars Superdome, Saturday, Feb. 1, 2025, in New Orleans, prior to the NFL Super Bowl 59 football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City  
NEW ORLEANS — Dominic Raiola never made a Super Bowl in his 14 NFL seasons, but the former longtime Detroit Lions center deserves an assist if the Philadelphia Eagles win one this week.. Eagles  
The Lions have been left out of the Super Bowl party for over 66 years. Detroit has long awaited the return of a top football team, and the 2024 Lions are just that. This team has so many things that it does so well that it has become incredibly hard not to consider them a Super Bowl favorite. Detroit has arguably the best offense in the entire  
Opening early in 2023, the Detroit Lions Super Bowl window has been opened and won’t close for a while. Here’s why I believe this franchise will be a top team for a long time. 
The Detroit Lions finished the regular season 15-2, tied with this year’s Kansas City Chiefs for the best record since the NFL expanded to a 17-game regular season for the 2021 season. 
The Detroit Lions are 9-14 in 23 NFL playoff games all-time across 18 appearances.  (hence the no Super Bowl trips). Last year, the Lions had a 24-7 lead over the San Francisco 49ers but  
The Detroit Lions' playoff run came to a heartbreaking end in the Divisional Round against the Washington Commanders. However, a recent admission by the NFL has reignited frustration for Lions fans, as it has been revealed that a missed penalty may have been a key turning point in the game that ultimately led to their loss. </p>
