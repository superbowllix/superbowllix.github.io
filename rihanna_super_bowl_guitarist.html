        <p>Despite their collaborative history, the Super Bowl show marked the first time Bettencourt and Rihanna had played together in almost a decade – and Bettencourt further celebrated their rekindled musical partnership by wielding a curiously eye-catching version of his Washburn N4 signature guitar. Rihanna’s band can first be seen at around  
A well-known Portuguese-American guitarist, singer-songwriter shared the stage with Grammy award-winning R&amp;B artist Rihanna for her halftime performance at the 2023 Super Bowl LVII in Phoenix  
Super Bowl experience aside, all eyes were on Bettencourt when, earlier this week (May 1), Extreme took the stage for the first time since Rise's release on the Monsters of Rock cruise. Debuting the song live , Bettencourt absolutely nailed its opening tremolo-picked section, wailing bends, light-speed alternate picking and massive whammy dives  
EXTREME guitarist Nuno Bettencourt shared the stage with Rihanna when the Grammy Award-winning R&amp;B artist took the stage in Phoenix Sunday (February 12) for her 2023 Super Bowl halftime performance. 
Rock fans watching this year’s Super Bowl likely experienced a jolt of unexpected delight when they caught a glimpse of one of their own – Nuno Bettencourt, ever-present Washburn N4 in hand – performing alongside Rihanna during her halftime-show extravaganza. But while his screen time was exceedingly brief – “about 1.5 milliseconds  
During Rihanna's 15-minute Super Bowl performance, Bettencourt was most visibly noticeable among her live band for a performance of "Run This Town," a 2009 Jay-Z single that features Rihanna with  
The Portuguese-American guitarist lent his superior six-string skills to several of the Umbrella singer’s tours – including her Last Girl On Earth, Loud and Diamonds World treks – and even supported her during her massive Super Bowl halftime show earlier this year. 
Nuno Bettencourt said that playing with Rihanna on this year's Super Bowl was a "bucket-list moment", but noted that the pop star's backing band got a "pathetic" amount of screen time. 
While visiting Lipps Service, hosted by Scott Lipps, Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt looked back on how he got the gig with Rihanna’s backing band, as well as the Super Bowl performance with the singer which took place earlier this year. Asked about how he got the chance to work with Rihanna’s live band back in 2009, Nuno said  
Super Bowl LVII (that's 57, for those of you not up to scratch on your Roman numerals) saw the Kansas City Chiefs overcome a 10-point halftime deficit to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles in a hugely entertaining game - but it was pop superstar Rihanna's epic halftime show that grabbed headlines in the music world. 
Bettencourt's most publicly visible gig, however, came with pop superstar Rihanna, with whom he embarked on a number of tours in the early 2010s, before re-joining the singer once again earlier this year at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show. 
'Technically, [it's] probably not difficult. But it was almost like a gig I had been training for my whole life' 
During a recent appearance on Trunk Nation, Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt talked about joining Rihanna's touring band back in 2009.You can check out a part of the conversation below

Rihanna's performance took place during the Half-Time show of the 57th Super Bowl - which was held on 12th February 2023. The game took place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, and saw the Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles. 
Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt has got lots of good memories of 2023, including bagging a UK Top 30 album with Six, his band’s first new record in 15 years, and playing the Super Bowl with Rihanna.
