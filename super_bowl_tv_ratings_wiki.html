        <p>[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets  
The following is a list of Super Bowl broadcasters, encompassing all national American television and radio networks, as well as sports announcers who have covered the first four AFL-NFL World Championship Games and subsequent championship games of the National Football League. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
Super Bowl television ratings have traditionally been high. One of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, the NFL's championship game is broadcast in over 130 countries in more than 30 languages. Viewership is predominantly North American; the Super Bowl is the most watched television broadcast in the United States every year. 
Famous Super Bowl commercials include the 1984 introduction of Apple's Macintosh computer, the Budweiser "Bud Bowl" campaign, and the dot-com ads aired during Super Bowl XXXIV. As the television ratings of the Super Bowl have steadily increased over the years, commercial prices have also increased, with advertisers paying as much as $7 million  
Super Bowl television ratings have traditionally been high. One of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, the NFL's championship game is broadcas 
Super Bowl television ratings and shares, including network (both NBC and CBS televised the first Super Bowl). The rating represents the percentage of televisions tuned in to a program. The share is the percentage of televisions on at the time that watched: 
Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched program in television history, with an average of 123.7 million viewers tuning in to the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win versus the 49ers. 
The audience for Super Bowl LVIII was so large that it approached the all-time most watched television broadcast in the United States set in 1969, when an estimated 125 to 150 million viewers  
This is a list of television ratings for NBA Finals in the United States, based on Nielsen viewing data. [1] The highest rated and most watched NBA Finals series was the 1998 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz, which averaged an 18.7 rating / 33 share and 29.04 million viewers on NBC. 
Although a series high, the episode was one of the lowest-rated Super Bowl lead-outs at the time. [2] [3] At Super Bowl LVIII, the series premiere of Tracker was pushed to 11:14 p.m. ET due to the game's overtime finish (which made it the longest Super Bowl game to-date), but CBS did achieve 18.4 million viewers. [4] 
Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, was the site of Super Bowl LVIII, the most-watched broadcast in American television history.. The Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969, is reported to have been watched by 125–150 million people. [4] 
The Super Bowl also drew a 41.6 rating, which beat out last year's Super Bowl by a small margin. A rating is the percentage of viewers with a TV who were watching the game. 
With the advent of Monday Night Football in 1970 it became common for the Super Bowl champion to appear in a "showcase" game the first weekend of the season. This was the case in 1978–1979, 1983, 1987–1988, 1990–1993, 1996–2000, and 2002–2003. [citation needed] Defending Super Bowl champions are 13–5 in the Kickoff Game. 
Super Bowl 50: Carolina Panthers vs. Denver Broncos: 8.32 February 7, 2016 CTV, RDS [20] [21] 16 Super Bowl XLVI: New York Giants vs. New England Patriots: 8.178 February 5, 2012 CTV, RDS [22] 17 Super Bowl LVI: Los Angeles Rams vs. Cincinnati Bengals: 8.177 February 13, 2022 CTV, TSN, RDS [23] 18 Super Bowl XLVIII: Seattle Seahawks vs. Denver  
The longest Super Bowl game also will go down as the most-watched program in television history. According to Nielsen and Adobe Analytics, the Kansas City Chiefs' 25-22 overtime victory versus the  
Super Bowl television ratings have traditionally been high. One of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, the NFL's championship game is broadcast in over 130 countries in more than 30 languages. However, viewership is predominantly North American; the Super Bowl is the most watched television broadcast in the United States every year. 
The ratings growth continued in the postseason—the 12 playoff games leading up to Sunday's Super Bowl averaged 38.5 million viewers on TV and streaming platforms, the Associated Press reported  
The network's telecast of Super Bowl XXVI on January 26, 1992 was seen by more than 123 million viewers nationally, second only to the 127 million that viewed Super Bowl XX. The ongoing 1990 television contract gave CBS rights to Super Bowl XXVI instead of Super Bowl XXVII, which was in the </p>
