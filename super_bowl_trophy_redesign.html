        <p>The logo was the first of its kind, as no other Super Bowl had involved the Lombardi Trophy in its design. And for the next 10 years, that – like just about everything else – would not change. 
Landor Associates, now Landor &amp; Fitch, partnered with the league and helped launch the redesign. How did the Super Bowl logo change from 2010 to 2020? For five straight years, the Super Bowl logo had the same formula: the Lombardi Trophy and stadium sitting atop “Super Bowl” and the Roman numerals. 
The Super Bowl LVII logo showcases a canyon and blue, turquoise, purple and red desert features as the game returned to Glendale, Arizona.The Lombardi Trophy is slightly behind the colorful “L  
The Roman numerals returned for Super Bowl LI, and so did repetitive logos. For the next five years, the logo went “L” plus the Lombardi Trophy plus the remaining numerals. 
Super Bowls 51 through 55 (2017-21) went solely with Roman numerals and a Lombardi Trophy, with a rotating color band over the words "Super Bowl" at the bottom. 
Super Bowls LI through LV had the Super Bowl title, roman numerals, and the Lombardi Trophy with very slight changes to the coloring. Themed Super Bowl logos return and a conspiracy 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. [1] 
“Once we got into (Super Bowl 40), you can see they’re starting to play with the idea of a standardized look. Starting with 40, it’s the same font for the Super Bowl every year, there’s a red and a blue star every year,” Creamer said. Then the Lombardi arrived. And with it, a modern, corporate and silver rendition of the “Midas  
For what it’s worth, the Super Bowl 50 logo also had a similar issue in that it looked like “Super Bowl 510” to some. For Super Bowl LVI, set to be played in 2022, however, the trophy has  
As visitors gather in New Orleans this week and millions tune into the Super Bowl on Sunday, Williams will be celebrating her artistry and culture. “I come from a great and beautiful culture, and I want the world to see it the same way as I do,” said Williams, 26, who is the first person to handcraft both the Super Bowl logo and theme art. 
We have made the iconic Vince Lombardi Trophy®, presented annually to the NFL® Super Bowl® championship team, since the first Super Bowl® in 1967. Oscar Riedener, a former Tiffany &amp; Co. Vice President, sketched the basic design for the trophy on a napkin during a 1966 meeting with then-NFL® Commissioner Pete Rozelle, and the rest was history. 
It first hosted Super Bowl IV in 1970 and last held the game in 2013 for Super Bowl XLVII. Where will Super Bowls 60 and 61 be played? The next two Super Bowls after 2025 have known locations. 
Super Bowl Logo 2020. The Super Bowl 2020 logo stands out from all previous versions. It began a modernized design for the famous sports symbol and launched a new era, presenting the emblem as a dream prize that requires professional growth. This is conveyed primarily by the light shades of the trophy, shining like a polished treasure. 
Super Bowl 59 is set for a rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, with the former seeking a historic three-peat and the latter its second ever Lombardi Trophy. 
The 1969 Super Bowl was the third iteration of the championship tournament, and the first to bear the trademarked “Super Bowl” name. Going for an all-American red, white, and blue motif, the design featured the wordmark in two lines, with the word “SUPER” in the top line colored red, and the bottom “BOWL III” colored blue.

The National Football League’s (NFL) forthcoming championship game, Super Bowl LIX, is set for February 9, 2025. This will be the 59th Super Bowl in NFL history. The event will occur at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
Next up, we have the Lombardi Trophy, or the Super Bowl Trophy. The NFL’s championship trophy was designed by Tiffany &amp; Co. back in 1966. In a fun piece of trivia, the Lombardi Trophy started as a sketch on a napkin during a meeting. 
The weight of the golden redesign will be felt more significantly when winning players attempt to hoist the Super Bowl 50 trophy: each number is 14.5 inches tall and weighs 33 pounds, making the  </p>
