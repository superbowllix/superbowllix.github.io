        <p>This is a list of current and former National Football League (NFL) franchise droughts (multiple consecutive seasons of not reaching a certain achievement) related to the post-season and Super Bowl.

Founded in 1928, the Lions organization is the oldest team in the NFL to never win a Super Bowl. They won the 1957 NFL Championship — ten years before Super Bowl I.

The longest all time Super Bowl drought belongs to the Detroit Lions, who have gone 66 years without appearing in a Super Bowl in this still active drought. Their last appearance in the Super Bowl, or rather, NFL Championship, which are counted the same for this drought, was in the 1957 season.
