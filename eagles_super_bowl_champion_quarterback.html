        <p>Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games.

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles (9) holds his daughter, Lily James, after winning the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game against the New England Patriots, Sunday, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles stood blow-for-blow with the greatest quarterback ever to stalk the gridiron, as the two teams combined for 1,151 yards -- shattering the record for most in any NFL game. 
NEW ORLEANS -- Two years after they went head to head in Super Bowl LVII, the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are set to square off for the next Lombardi Trophy. And once again, the  
The Philadelphia Eagles are a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night in New Orleans away from winning the franchise’s second Super Bowl following a 55-23 thrashing of the Washington  
Minus the Eagles first Super Bowl appearance in 1981, which saw them get blitzed by the Oakland Raiders, Philadelphia has played in one-score games across the board. If they make another  
The Eagles have a five-point lead on New England, 2 minutes and 21 seconds remaining in Super Bowl LII. On the field comes Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who to this point has thrown for TK yards of the Patriots' 570 total net yards. 
Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
The Eagles have an 8-0 turnover differential this postseason, which is the second best entering a Super Bowl ever, behind only the 1998 Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos who forced nine turnovers  
Thirteen years later, the Eagles got their revenge on the Patriots in their first Super Bowl victory. Nick Foles and Doug Pederson put up 41 points on New England and became iconic figures in  
The Philadelphia Eagles are going to the Super Bowl for the second time in three years after earning a 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders in the 2025 NFC championship game. Philadelphia's  
Jalen Alexander Hurts [1] (born August 7, 1998) is an American professional football quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He began his college football career with the Alabama Crimson Tide, leading the team to consecutive College Football Playoff National Championship appearances in 2016 and 2017. 
Two years ago, he led the Eagles into Super Bowl LVII against the Kansas City Chiefs, and came up a field goal short. He was asked in a press conference Thursday what he hopes is different this time around as the Eagles face the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. “I’d like to win the game,” he said simply. </p>
