        <h2><strong>tecmo super bowl best version jets super bowl winning coach</strong></h2>
        <p>The NES Tecmo Super Bowl is the best version. It's hard to think of another company that tanked so hard in the 16-bit era as far as quality goes compared to the 8-bit days and then came back with the Team Ninja games to become a good developer again. 
I’ve only played Tecmo Bowl and Tecmo Super Bowl for NES and Tecmo Super Bowl III for the SNES. I loved Tecmo Bowl as a kid so it’s my favorite. The first game I remember being able to be competitive with my dad at as a young guy. I still play it all the time, such a great game. 
Tecmo Super Bowl for NES is the best In my opinion. NFL rosters were better in 1991 than they were in 1993/94/95(rosters used in 16 bit versions). The player photos, the cut scenes were better, and the novelty of such a deep, playable sports game on such a limited system. 
Among the Tecmo Super Bowl community, it is common for distinguished groups/tournament organizers (such as the Tomczak Bowl) to create tier lists, rankings of a teams's potential in tournaments. Tomczak Bowl uses a tier system of play. Teams are grouped into tiers of five based on their overall strength of play. Tier 1 is reserved for the best teams while Tier 5 is for the not so great. All 28

The game Tecmo Super Bowl was released for NES in December of 1991, and is the greatest sports game ever released on that system (not only imho, but I think by popular consensus). For my money, it has a case as the greatest sports game period, as well as for the greatest all-around game ever released for NES [to me, at least]. There may not be  
Hello Everyone About three months ago, I contacted Baron von Lector about updating his Tecmo Super Bowl-GOLD from 7 years ago as of this date. To me, it is the most brilliant version of the game since I started playing it back in 1991. Mr. Baron then posted that he would make some 7-year updates  
The main menu of Tecmo Super Bowl provided the player with options for NFL Preseason, Season Game (Regular Season) and Pro Bowl play. Team data could also be accessed from the main menu. In the original NES Tecmo Bowl, each team had 20 players on its roster, with nine players for offense, nine players for defense, a kicker, and a punter. In  
OP is right. Tecmo Super Bowl is the greatest NES game. But I think you have to divide things into two camps: sports fans and non-sports fans. It’s easily the best sports game. But if someone doesn’t care about sports, they don’t care about Tecmo Super Bowl. 
I love the SNES 16 bit version, maybe because I played it more. I have fond memories of a few friends and my brother, playing it in college on anold SNES, drinking beer, talking shit, and constantly playing SF v BUF because they were the two best teams. I loved this game even before I cared about Football. 
Please post what you think are the top 5 best teams in SNES - Tecmo Super Bowl TOP 5. 1. SF. 2. BUF. 3. DAL. 4. HOU. 5. PIT. Edited March 27, 2013 by 8-bit 
I've found a lot of discussion on the best teams in the NES version but since the rosters are different on the SNES and Sega versions of Tecmo Super Bowl which teams are the best and which are the worsts? 
The classic NES sports title, updated with 32 NCAA Division One teams from the 2024-25 season! Enjoy this version with the following features: Includes 32 NCAA Division One teams from the 2024-25 season. Playbooks edited – Plays moved to different slots, edited running plays, removed ‘bad’ plays. 
I have only played the original Tecmo Super Bowl game. Is III based off the '94 players with the '95 team schedule? Yeah that was the season that the Niners were trying to build a team through free agency that could beat Dallas and the Cowboys were starting to lose some of their depth through free agency (and players like Ken Norton signed with  
Tecmo Super Bowl 1991 - TikTok Team is a rom I made for a group of friends that are fans of retro games and Tecmo Super Bowl 1991 on TikTok. Sblueman's Redux roms inspired me to make the fixes to the original game that have always bothered me. I combined those two projects. I am posting the origi 
I have it and it works really well, probably the best version of tecmo super bowl out there. It has every great hack from this site as well. Edited March 19, 2019 by Atrain400 
I'm sure you guys have played seasons with only one goal in mind; really, that's the only type of year I play any more on any Tecmo version. My favorite is the recent one I did with the Browns wherein I decided to set the receptions record with Rico Smith, who is probably one of the worst WRs in the whole game. 
Tecmo Super Bowl [a] is an American football video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) that was released in December 1991. Developed by Tecmo, it is the first sports video game that was licensed by both the National Football League and the National Football League Players Association, thus allowing the game to use both the names and attributes of real NFL teams and real NFL players. 
The Good Tecmo Super Bowl's (T.S.B. for short) great gameplay and controls are easy to grasp, you have a selection of 8 plays (4 Running, 4 Passing) and are also able to punt and kick a field goal. T.S.B. stays true to the NFL and the feel of it. 
Okay this rom will be better for juice offs or just one player tap testing. 1. Start a man v com game (1 player tap test), or MAN v MAN game (2 player juice off) 2. At the kickoff you won't see the punt bar but instead the clock will count down from 3. Start tapping before it gets to zero. 3. Onc </p>
