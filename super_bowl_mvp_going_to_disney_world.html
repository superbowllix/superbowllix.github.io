        <p>Super Bowl LIV MVP Patrick Mahomes in the parade at the Magic Kingdom the day after the game "I'm going to Disney World!" and "I'm going to Disneyland!" are advertising slogans used in a series of television commercials by The Walt Disney Company that began airing in 1987. [1]

Players named the MVP of the Super Bowl have for decades proclaimed that they're going to Disneyland or Disney World to celebrate their accomplishment as part of Disney's ad campaign. 
Typically, the Super Bowl MVP is the one who says the iconic catchphrase after the game and is treated to a subsequent trip to Disneyland or Disney World. But that isn't always the case. 
New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms, the Super Bowl XXI MVP, became the first player to proclaim “I’m going to Disney World!” during the post-game celebrations. 
The Super Bowl Disney World trip is a decades-long NFL tradition. Since 1987, Super Bowl MVPs have been treated to a trip to "The Happiest Place on Earth. 
The “going to Disney World” spot “might be the most iconic commercial ever made,” Mark Champion,  At the Super Bowl in 1988 the MVP was Doug Williams, the first Black quarterback in the  
The beloved tradition dates back to Super Bowl XXI in 1987, according to Disney Parks Blog.As ESPN also reports, New York Giants quarterback and MVP Phil Simms was the first to shout the now  
After his 2019 Super Bowl win, his last with the New England Patriots, Brady and game MVP Julian Edelman appeared in the Walt Disney World parade the day after the game. 
I was the MVP of the Super Bowl and had more people asking me about the Disney commercial than how I played the game,” Simms said. “When the commercial came out the next day, everybody just

Disney's marketing department began working on the campaign and coordinated efforts to work with the Super Bowl XXI MVP. In 1987, that was Phil Simms of the New York Giants. 
The "I'm going to Disney!" tradition didn't start until Super Bowl 21 in 1987. Twice in history there was no Disney theme park celebration in Orlando or Anaheim for the winning Super Bowl team. 
I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information from the Disney playbook. I just spoke to an MVP of a Cast Member who confirmed that, at the time of this writing, no official announcement has been made about the Super Bowl parade. However, this Cast Member also told me that a Super Bowl parade generally occurs the day after the big  
Each year after the Super Bowl game, it has been a tradition for a player of the winning team (usually the MVP) to say that they going to Disneyland or Disney World, which is followed by their appearance soon after (often the next day) as part of a celebratory cavalcade. 
This year, Super Bowl LIX will be held in New Orleans, and the winning MVP player will be headed to visit Disney World the day afterward. In this year's game, the Kansas City Chiefs face off with the Philidelphia Eagles. We will share everything you need to know about the 2025 Super Bowl parade at Disney World! 
However, with this year’s game in New Orleans, the pendulum seems poised to swing back to Walt Disney World in Florida. If the winning team does head to Walt Disney World, fans can expect a magical celebration on Main Street, U.S.A., featuring the Super Bowl MVP waving to crowds, perhaps joined by a few teammates. 
One of the Super Bowl's most famous and long-established traditions has nothing do with football, let alone the NFL. Every year, the Super Bowl MVP proclaims "I'm going to Disney World!" to an  
At this time, we still don't know if the winning team of this year's Super Bowl will be visiting Walt Disney World or Disneyland for the parade of MVPs. With last year's game taking place in Las Vegas, the winning team went to nearby Disneyland for their parade , so it is possible that this year's parade will take place at Magic Kingdom since
