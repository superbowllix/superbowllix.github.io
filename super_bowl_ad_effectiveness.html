The 2022 Super Bowl managed a decent improvement in audience size and a slight improvement in measured advertising effectiveness according to the ad-testing firm, ABX Advertising Benchmark Index and Nielsen. As shown in Exhibit 1, the viewing audience of 94 million for the prior Super Bowl 2021 was the lowest in ten years.

A well-deserved 4-Stars for this Super Bowl debut. Five key themes sum up Super Bowl ads this year: Movie/TV homages: Super Bowl night sometimes felt more like Oscars night as brands like T-Mobile, Michelob Ultra, and Rakuten made ads riffing on classic movies.
