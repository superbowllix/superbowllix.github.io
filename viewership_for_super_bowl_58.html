In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people. This is currently the second biggest average viewership in Super Bowl (and U.S. television) history. [76] 
Sunday's game was only the second of the 58 Super Bowls to go to overtime. The previous one was in 2017,  the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. 
The Super Bowl 58 featuring the Kansas City Chiefs versus the San Francisco 49ers has shattered all previous TV ratings records, with a historic estimated 123.7 million viewers. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
San Francisco 49ers fans celebrate a touchdown as they watch the Super Bowl 58 NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs from a pool on top of the Circa Resort and Casino, Sunday, Feb. 11  
Specifically, the 112 million official viewership of Super Bowl 51 – which is believed to stretch to as much as 124 million – would surpass 58’s total. CBS last broadcast the Super Bowl in 2021, when it aired Super Bowl 55, which at 91.6 million English-language viewers was the lowest-watched Super Bowl since 2006. 
CBS Sports' presentation of the Kansas City Chiefs' overtime victory in Super Bowl 58 was the most-watched telecast in history, with more than 120 million viewers across all CBS platforms. 
Super Bowl 58 was the most-watched program ever, up 7% in viewership from Super Bowl 57, which held the previous record with 115.1 million average viewers. More than 200 million viewers watched at

According to Nielsen, more than 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all or part of Super Bowl 58, which is the highest unduplicated total audience in history, up 10% year over year. 
That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
Women accounted for 47.5% of the overall audience, up from 46.7% last year. (Per the New York Post, that 47.5% mark is a new record for the Super Bowl.) There were 4.4 million additional female viewers than last year, compared to 3.0 million additional male viewers. Super Bowl 58 demographic breakdown

Super Bowl 58 was the most-watched television broadcast in a generation. Sunday's overtime thriller averaged 123.4 million viewers. 
Nielsen also reported 202.4 million viewers had tuned in to some portion (a minimum of six minutes) of Super Bowl LVIII, a year-over-year increase of 10% (184 million). </p>
