Last year, Taylor Swift attended Super Bowl LVIII to watch her boyfriend Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs take on (and beat) the San Francisco 49ers. Reports indicate that she will be in attendance again this year to watch her “Lover” and his team go head-to-head with the Philadelphia Eagles. 
A drinking game is the best way to pass the less-than-exciting parts of any football game, so we created one with Super Bowl LVIII in mind: ﻿Introducing our "Swiftie Bowl" drinking game. 
Super Bowl LVIII takes place tonight as fans worldwide will watch the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the San Francisco 49ers. Like the World Cup or the Olympics, the NFL’s biggest game a 
In case you are totally out of the loop, Super Bowl LVIII goes down on Sunday, February 11, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada when the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs take the field and  
Taylor Swift fans are likely looking forward to another stellar appearance of their favourite singer at yet-another Kansas City Chiefs game. Except it’s not just any game but the Super Bowl LVIII, where Travis Kelce’s team will play against the San Francisco 49ers for the coveted Lombardi Trophy. 
They've snagged a spot in Super Bowl LVIII, which isn't only exciting if you're a 49ers or Chiefs fan — it's also good news if you're a Taylor Swift fan. Not only did the Chiefs previously defeat the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV, but they also emerged victorious in 2023's Big Game, so there's a lot on the line. 
Get ready to elevate your Super Bowl LVIII experience with a trending drinking game that's making waves across the country! As the San Francisco 49ers face off against the Kansas City Chiefs on February 11th in Las Vegas, Nevada, fans can add an extra layer of excitement—in between camera shots of Taylor Swift—to the game.

We also know that Usher will be the featured artist during  
Top five Super Bowl drinking games in 2024 #1 Touchdown cup. Playing the Touchdown Cup drinking game is one of the finest ways to get wild while managing the pace during the Super Bowl. 
5. Usher brings out a guest during his halftime performance. 6. A new Super Bowl commercial makes you cry, laugh, or have any emotional reaction other than screaming at the screen over the game. 
With the opening of Potawatomi Sportsbook last April, Super Bowl LVIII is the first installment of the big game that you can (legally) bet on in Milwaukee. While you can certainly put some money
