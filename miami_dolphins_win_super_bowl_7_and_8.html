        <p>Despite being undefeated, the Dolphins were actually one-point underdogs, [7] largely based on the weakness of their regular season schedule (and losing the previous Super Bowl). [8] Super Bowl VII was largely dominated by the Dolphins, and is the second-lowest-scoring Super Bowl to date with a total of only 21 points (three touchdowns and

Backup QB Earl Morrall in the Dolphins' 28-24 win over the New York Jets in 1972 The Dolphins' 17-0-0 season culminated with a 14-7 victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII. It is a unique feat that has stood the test of time. 
The Dolphins were the first team to reach the Super Bowl with a perfect record. The second team to do so, the 2007 Patriots, rode an 18-game winning streak into Super Bowl XLII but lost that game  
When did the Miami Dolphins win the Super Bowl last time? The Miami Dolphins most recent Super Bowl win was in 1973 against the Washington Redskins. Dolphins defeated Redskins with a score of 14-7. 
Super Bowl VIII: Miami Dolphins 24, Minnesota Vikings 7  Led by Larry Csonka, who was named the Super Bowl MVP, the win cemented the Dolphins' status as the team to beat in the early 1970s. 
The Dolphins defeated the Washington Redskins 14-7 in Super Bowl VII on Jan. 14, 1973 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to finish 17-0. 
The 1972 Miami Dolphins team is considered one of the greatest in NFL history, and their Super Bowl VII win was the pinnacle of their success. The team completed the season with a perfect 17-0

Miami Dolphins’ Howard Twilley takes in a Bob Griese pass and heads for the end zone for a touchdown in the first quarter of the Super Bowl game in Los Angeles, Jan. 14, 1973. Twilley, a key receiver for the Miami Dolphins during their perfect 1972 season and a Heisman Trophy runner-up at the University of Tulsa, died on Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2025. 
That actually began last week, and one media exercise had Nate Davis of USA Today ranking the 59 best Super Bowl teams — winners or losers — in honor of this being Super Bowl LIX. The Dolphins

Super Bowl VIII: Miami Dolphins 24 Minnesota Vikings 7 - MVP Dolphins RB Larry Csonka - Racking up over 100 yards rushing for two Super Bowls in a row, Csonka's 33 carries wore down the Vikings. The bruising back finished with 145 yards and two touchdowns in Miami's second consecutive Super Bowl victory (24-7). Miami quarterback Bob Griese attempted only seven passes. Minnesota quarterback  
That win in Super Bowl VIII on Jan. 13, 1974, is Miami’s most recent title. Shula remained the head coach until 1995 when he retired. He reached the playoffs 12 more times, including two more Super Bowl appearances in 1983 (Super Bowl XVII) and 1985 (Super Bowl XIX), but Miami lost to Washington and San Francisco, respectively. 
The lead-up to Super Bowl VIII was unprecedented. The Miami Dolphins became the first team to qualify for three consecutive championships, a brand new city volunteered to host the big game (Houston, Texas), and both teams went into Super Bowl VIII with the same regular-season record (12-2). January 13, 1974, brought together reigning Super Bowl []

Jim Kiick (#21) rushes for Miami in Super Bowl VII. The 1972 Miami Dolphins season was the franchise's seventh season and third in the National Football League (NFL). The team was led by third-year head coach Don Shula and achieved the only perfect season in NFL history. It also led the league in both points scored and fewest points allowed.

Miami's seven pass attempts were the fewest ever thrown by a team in the Super Bowl. The Dolphins rushed for 196 yards, did not have any turnovers, and were not penalized in the first 52 minutes.
