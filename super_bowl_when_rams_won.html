        <p>The Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years. Eight franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls, one of which (Pittsburgh) has accomplished it twice: 
Super Bowl XXXIV: St. Louis Rams 23, Tennessee Titans 16. The Rams defied expectations in the 1999-2000 season. Projected to win just 5.5 games and starting a relatively unknown QB in Kurt Warner, they were +15000 to win the Super Bowl entering the year. They would win 13 of their 16 regular-season games to win the NFC West and clinch the No. 1  
The Los Angeles Rams last won the Super Bowl in the 2021 season. The Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in the Super Bowl. 
They also won two pre-Super Bowl era championships in 1945 as the Cleveland Rams and 1951 during their first stint in Los Angeles. [31] After the Rams lost 2018's Super Bowl LIII, quarterback Jared Goff suffered a decline in production, which led to tension between Goff and McVay. [32] 
Prior to appearances in Super Bowls 53 and 56, the LA Rams' last appearance came in Super Bowl 14 on Jan. 20, 1980 — a 31-19 loss to the Steelers. It should be noted that the St. Louis Rams have  
It was the Rams' first Super Bowl championship as an L.A. team and its second in franchise history. Including the pre-Super Bowl era, the franchise has won four NFL championships. 
Super Bowl XIV (1980): The Rams fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31-19. Super Bowl XXXVI (2002): The “Greatest Show on Turf” era ended with a loss to the New England Patriots, 20-17. Super Bowl LIII (2019): Los Angeles was defeated by the Patriots again, 13-3, in a defensive showdown. A Bright Future 
The franchise was on the move again in 1995 when the Rams moved to St. Louis for 10 years before returning to the City of Angels, but not before claiming their first Super Bowl win. But before the year 2000, the Rams had only appeared in one Super Bowl back in January 1980, when a record attendance of 103,985 watched on as Pittsburgh Steelers  
The Rams have won two Super Bowls (Super Bowl XXXIV and Super Bowl LVI ) and two NFL Championships (1945 and 1951). Out of five Super Bowl appearances, the Rams have won two of them. 
The Rams have won two Super Bowls in franchise history. They won Super Bowl XXXIV 23-16 over the Titans when they were the St. Louis Rams. After moving back to Los Angeles, they won Super Bowl LVI against the Bengals 23-20. The Rams also won two NFL Championships before the Super Bowl era. They won titles in 1951 as the Los Angeles Rams and

The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in Super Bowl LVI on Sunday. The suspenseful game ended with a fourth down stop by the Rams to win it all. 
Warner’s Super Bowl win with the St. Louis Rams came just five years after he was stocking shelves at an Iowa grocery store. February 2, 2025 at 6:00 a.m. EST Just now. 11 min. 
Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, the first undrafted quarterback to win a Super Bowl, was named Super Bowl MVP after setting Super Bowl records for passing yards and pass attempts without an interception. [8] [9] [10] Warner became the sixth player to win Super Bowl MVP and NFL MVP in a single season, a feat that would go unrepeated for 23 seasons  
For this year’s Super Bowl, the Kansas City Chiefs are 1.5-point favorites over the Philadelphia Eagles with a posted total of 48.5 points. The odds on the Super Bowl have been known to change, and there’s still a few days until the game. 
The Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 after a late comeback to win their second Super Bowl title. It was a fourth-quarter touchdown with less than 2 minutes left that sealed the deal. 
The Rams will take back over but it's all academic now as the Rams win this game and are Super Bowl 56 champions. 9:57 p.m.: On third-and-1, the Bengals keep it on the ground with Samaje Perine
