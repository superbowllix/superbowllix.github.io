The NFL champion Baltimore Colts were completely and utterly dominant entering Super Bowl III. They lost just one game in the regular season, a ten-point loss to Cleveland. Without that loss, we’re talking about the league’s first-ever 14-0 team. As it was, the Colts entered the postseason at 13-1. 
Conclusion. Super Bowl III marked the first time that the AFL would win the championship in the season’s biggest football game. With a big-league merger on the horizon after the upcoming season, Super Bowl IV would be the last chance for both the NFL and AFL to prove themselves the dominant league. 
Super Bowl III was the third AFL-NFL Championship Game in professional American football, but the first to officially bear the name "Super Bowl".

The Jets had managed a solid defense throughout the season, but going into Super Bowl III, the Jets passing defense was not considered particularly strong. With the Jets installed as an 18-point underdog, Beverly's small stature made him a main target of Colts' quarterback Earl Morrall . 
Super Bowl III is really when things changed. The 66 and 67 Packers cared more about repeating as NFL champions. Winning the "AFL-NFL Championship Game" was anticlimactic for them. But the Colts were so traumatized by losing Super Bowl III they never got over it, even when they won Super Bowl V two years later.

Super Bowl III has been rehashed, talked about, re-shown, and re-released in 1997 (as a video broadcast) for a generation to see for themselves a landmark game that changed the course of the NFL. It validated the AFL , its history , along with legitimizing the merger between the two leagues. </p>
