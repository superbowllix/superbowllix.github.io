        <p>For Super Bowl LIV in 2020, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products was the official sponsor of that game's MVP ceremony; [15] Patrick Mahomes' announcement of the phrase was thus embedded into the broadcast post-game show, which included appearances by Mickey and Minnie Mouse alongside 10 year-old Make-a-Wish child Nathaniel from Austin, Texas. 
Mahomes appeared in the victory parade with Disney characters in Disneyland Park. The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a parade at Walt Disney World was in 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade on Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom.

Mahomes’s post-game proclamation is the centerpiece of Disney’s annual Super Bowl commercial airing on major TV networks and social media sites nationwide in English and Spanish. 
Mahomes continues a long tradition of superstar players celebrating a Super Bowl championship by shouting “I’m Going to Disneyland.” The iconic phrase is the centerpiece of Disney’s famous Super Bowl commercial which started in 1987 and has added a little pixie dust every year to America’s biggest sporting event. 
The three Super Bowl stars set to celebrate the big win with a fun-filled day at Disneyland Resort ; ANAHEIM, Calif, (Feb. 13, 2022) – When the final whistle blew to seal the Los Angeles Rams’ remarkable Super Bowl LVI victory Sunday night, the jubilant MVP Cooper Kupp, Aaron Donald and Matthew Stafford turned to the TV cameras and, with

This year, Super Bowl LIX will be held in New Orleans, and the winning MVP player will be headed to visit Disney World the day afterward.

The last time the Super Bowl champions appeared in a public-facing parade at Walt Disney World was in February 2020 when the Kansas City Chiefs also played and defeated the San Francisco 49ers. The Super Bowl that year was held in Miami and MVP Patrick Mahomes celebrated with a parade down Main Street in Magic Kingdom. 
It has become a beloved tradition for the Super Bowl MVP—or sometimes a group of key players from the winning team—to head to a Disney park for a victory parade. In recent years, the location has leaned toward Disneyland due to the proximity of the Super Bowl being played in Las Vegas, Arizona, and California. 
Walt Disney World Hosting Super Bowl LIX Parade. The parade will take place at Magic Kingdom as players from the winning team ride down Main Street USA. An exact time for the parade has not yet been announced. Super Bowl LIX features the Kansas City Chiefs vs the Philadelphia Eagles and it will air on Fox starting at 6:30pm ET on Sunday
