Game summary of the Baltimore Ravens vs. San Francisco 49ers NFL game, final score 34-31, from February 3, 2013 on ESPN.

Super Bowl XLVII (meaning Super Bowl 47 in Roman numerals) was a Super Bowl game in which the Baltimore Ravens, winners of the American Football Conference (AFC) for the 2012 season, beat the San Francisco 49ers, winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) for the 2012 season, 34–31 to become winners of National Football League (NFL) for the 2012 season.

Super Bowl XLVII wasn’t special because the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers were the greatest teams in the league, nor is it a game remembered for its wildly surprising outcome. The 47th Super Bowl grabbed national attention because both squads’ head coaches were brothers — Jim and John Harbaugh — and an unexpected 34-minute []

Super Bowl XLVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2012 season. The Ravens defeated the 49ers by the score of 34–31, handing the 49ers their first Super Bowl loss in their franchise history

Super Bowl XLVIII was the first Super Bowl held at an open-air stadium in a "cold-weather" city; previous Super Bowls in cold-weather cities were held at indoor stadiums. However, the temperature at kickoff was a mild 49 °F (9 °C), making this only the third-coldest Super Bowl. [37] A major snow storm hit the area the very next day. [38]
