        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Tom DiMuzio was the first Delaware quarterback to throw for more than 2,000 yards in a season when he passed for 2,179 in his second year as a starter in 1969, when he was an All-American. 
The 2019 Pro Bowl pick had another big year in 2020, despite missing several games due to injury, after the Bucs’ signing of quarterback Tom Brady. The Super Bowl was actually his quietest game

Joe Flacco, Audubon (Super Bowl XLVII): The former Delaware star was terrific in the Ravens’ 34-31 win over the San Francisco 49ers. Flacco completed 22-of-33 passes for 287 yards and three  
An article last Sunday about the college alma maters of quarterbacks who started the Super Bowl misstated, in some copies, the given name of one of the six Delaware quarterbacks to sign with an N  
Here are the 10 highest rushing yard outputs in Super Bowl history by a quarterback: Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl LVII: 70 Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs, Super Bowl LVIII: 66 
He outplayed Mahomes in Philly's Super Bowl 57 loss, passing for 304 yards and a TD while rushing for 70 yards (most by a quarterback on Super Sunday) and three more scores, tying Davis' mark.

He led the Ravens to the Super Bowl XLVII title in 2012 and was named the game’s Most Valuable Player after throwing for 287 yards and three touchdowns in the 34-31 win over San Francisco. At the time of his induction into the UD Athletics Hall of Fame, he had thrown for nearly 30,000 yards during his career. 
Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320  
Barkley is without a doubt the most likely non-quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP and the running back is currently priced at +260 with most USA bookmakers to take home the award. It is very rare that any player has better odds than either starting quarterback at the Super Bowl, but Barkley is priced significantly lower than teammate Jalen  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Only five colleges have produced a US President and a Super Bowl winning quarterback Trivia • Ben Roethlisberger (XL, XLIII) and Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893) both attended Miami of Ohio University. 
Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is favored to win Super Bowl MVP at +105 (if you bet $100 you would win $105).  Delaware Park is hosting a Super Bowl "pep rally" from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Friday. 
He won a Super Bowl as the MVP, he equalled the record for most touchdowns in a game (7), has the fifth-highest quarterback rating in a season ever (119.2), and yet, apart from a couple of years in Philly, was never consistently a starter. 
On second down, Stafford found Cooper Kupp in the end zone. Then the Rams defense held off the Bengals. The Rams, meanwhile, sacked Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow seven times, tying a Super Bowl  
Ben Roethlisberger has won two Super Bowl rings with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the first at Super Bowl XL in 2006 and the second in Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. He also lost Super Bowl XLV in 2011. Ben was the quarterback of the Miami Redhawks while at Miami and is the career record holder for pass completions. The school has since retired his jersey 
Thirty-seven years ago, Louisiana-born Doug Williams became the first Black quarterback to start and win the Super Bowl. He played for the Washington Redskins (now Commanders). 
Ferragamo had shared the starting quarterback job with Steve Bartkowski at Cal for two seasons before moving on the Nebraska. In Super Bowl XIV, Ferragamo was 15-for-25 for 212 yards, no  </p>
