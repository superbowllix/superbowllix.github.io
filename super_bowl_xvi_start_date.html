Super Bowl XVI marked the beginning of a new era in the NFL, with the San Francisco 49ers claiming their first Super Bowl title. Joe Montana’s MVP performance and Bill Walsh’s innovative coaching set the foundation for the 49ers’ future dominance in the 1980s. 
Super Bowl XVI was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1981 season.

San Francisco finished the regular season with a league-best 13–3 record.
