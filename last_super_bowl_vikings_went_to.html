The Vikings squandered a 12-2 record the following year, giving up a lead to the Cowboys in the Division round.

Oakland scored the first 19 points in Super Bowl XI and the Raiders went on to win, 32-14.

The Vikings also made the Super Bowl in 1974 (Super Bowl VIII), 1975 (Super Bowl IX) and 1970 (Super Bowl IV). All four of Minnesota’s Super Bowl appearances came in the 1970’s. 
The Vikings last made the Super Bowl in the 1976 season, when they fell short of a ring in a 14-32 loss to the Oakland Raiders. While Tarkenton and the offense improved slightly from their 1974 loss, the QB still completed fewer than 50 percent of his passes, connecting on 17-of-35 for 205 yards, one score, and two interceptions. 
The team won one NFL Championship in 1969, and was the last team crowned NFL champions before the AFL–NFL merger in 1970.

The Vikings have been divisional champions 20 times, most among current members of their division.
