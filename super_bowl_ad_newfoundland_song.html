A Super Bowl ad by vacation rental company VRBO has ruffled the feathers of some rural Canadians, who saw the spot as condescending and making a mockery of their country life.. The 30-second ad  
The commercial, promoting the home-sharing platform Vrbo, was aired during the Super Bowl and showcases unconventional accommodations, including farm animals, against the backdrop of the traditional Newfoundland and Labrador folk song, "I’se The B’y." The ad playfully takes a jab at competitors like Airbnb. Despite the fact the commercial  
“To use the song “I’se the B’y” for their ad in such a way, it was almost like using a slur on our province,” Brophy said in an interview Monday. The ad caused a stir on X, formerly Twitter, during the Super Bowl, with some saying the classic Newfoundland song was used to connote something stereotypically rural and undesirable.

VRBO ran a commercial with a Newfoundland classic song “I’se the b’y” during the Super Bowl yesterday and it has caused a lot of complaining on line, which is to be expected from us. Folks from here though it was a bit insensitive for various reasons, one being it wasn’t an ad for vacationing here. 
UMMM the @vrbo Ad that uses the song Ise da By during Super Bowl is SO RUDE. Insinuating rural travel is somehow less desirable – bad take. Your song selection hails from a truly magical place, and a world class destination. Your ad is embarrassing for you. See article below. Kristina Ennis (@kristinaennis) February 11, 2024

The part of the song they used basically implies that there is a person who builds the boat, a person that sails the boat, and a person who catches the fish.
