Super Bowl XII provided an opportunity for Morton to not only beat his former team, but also to redeem himself for his Super Bowl V loss and the loss of his starting job to Staubach. For Staubach, he had a chance to win his second Super Bowl and defeat his old rival, showing that he truly was the better quarterback of the two.

The Jets' most recent championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002

Super Bowl XII was the first Super Bowl to be played indoors. The Superdome should have hosted the ninth Super Bowl, but when the stadium was behind schedule, the contest was switched to Tulane Stadium. For the first time in Super Bowl history, two players took away the MVP award when Randy White and Harvey Martin shared the honor. 
The Denver Broncos got schooled by the Dallas Cowboys, 27 to 10, in Super Bowl XII on January 15, 1978. 
New Orleans on Super Bowl Sunday 1978 was cold and dreary, continuing the trend of the whole week. The high temperature was in the mid-40s. The Superdome opened in time for the 1975 football season. But that was too late for Super Bowl IX, which had to be played in Tulane Stadium in January that year because of construction delays. 
Other Players The NFL Players Association sent on strike after Week 2. The Week 3 games were cancelled and the League resumed play in Week 4 with replacement players and the few regulars who crossed the picket lines. Week 7 saw the end of the strike and the return of all of the regular players.

Likewise New Orleans was passed over since the Superdome was already set to host Super Bowl XII. This was the first Super Bowl held on January 21 or later. For the 1978–79 season, the NFL extended its schedule from 14 regular season games to 16 and increased the playoffs from an 8-team tournament to 10, creating two extra playoff games.

It was the second consecutive Super Bowl loss for the Broncos, who had lost to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl the year before. This Super Bowl came at the end of a season that was shortened by a players' strike. Each team only missed one regular season game due to the labor dispute, but three games were played mostly with replacement  
Super Bowl XII. When the Dallas Cowboys wound up as contenders again in 1978, more than just their second championship was on the line. Super Bowl XII would be a high-pressure match-up between Cowboys’ starting quarterback Roger Staubach and the quarterback he split playing time with while in Dallas five seasons back — Craig Morton, now of the Denver Broncos.
