        <p>Detroit has never been to a Super Bowl. As a result, their streak is up to 57 years, with a chance to extend to 58 if the team can't take down San Francisco in the 2024 NFC championship game. 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The Detroit Lions are a professional American  entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8  have played on Thanksgiving ever since  
A Brief History of the Detroit Lions’ Super Bowl Journey. The Detroit Lions started in 1930. They were successful in the 1930s and 1950s. But, their Super Bowl history is different, filled with challenges and missed chances. The Rise of the Lions: 1930s to 1950s. The Lions won their first World Championship in 1935 against the New York Giants. 
However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships, with the last coming in 1957. They are one of 14 teams in NFL history to have won four or more NFL Championships. NFL Championship Wins by the Lions

Detroit is seen as a real Super Bowl contender in 2023 and has an outside shot to be the top seed in the NFC. In fact, they have been at the top end of the NFC standings for most of the season. Given the Lions’ abysmal postseason record, they had become an ongoing joke for football fans. 
The Detroit Lions have not yet won a Super Bowl, as of December 2024. Get detailed information on Detroit Lions Super Bowl Appearances, their championships wins and much more on Sportskeeda. 
Before the Super Bowl even existed, the Lions were a serious force. They won championships in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957, with legends like Bobby Layne and Doak Walker running the show. 
Since the Super Bowl began in 1967, Detroit has never reached the big game. The Lions won four championships (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) but they arrived before the NFL was fully formed. 
The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX. 
Detroit shone in the spotlight on Feb. 5, 2006 as the city played host to Super Bowl XL at Ford Field. Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Hines Ward was walking on air after his 43-yard touchdown catch
