The complete list of Super Bowl champions throughout NFL history. The Super Bowl locations, dates, losing teams, and final scores are also included (1967-2024). 
The Packers would also win Super Bowl II, and in 1970, the NFL would rename the “World Professional Football Championship Trophy” to the Vince Lombardi Trophy. 
Which team has won the most Super Bowls? There are two teams tied with the most Super Bowl wins. Both the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots have won the Super Bowl 6 times. There are two teams tied with the third most Super Bowl wins. 
Meanwhile, the Cowboys won three Super Bowl titles in four years between the 1992 and 1995 seasons. Additionally, the Steelers won four Super Bowls in six years between the 1974 and 1979 NFL seasons. The Chiefs hope to become the first team to achieve this feat during the 2024 season. If Kansas City can hoist the Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl  
The Kansas City Chiefs face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday. Follow for live updates on the game, Usher’s halftime show, the Super Bowl ads and more. 
It was the second Super Bowl to go into overtime — the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons in overtime in Super Bowl LI in 2017 — but it was the first with the revised postseason

Sunday’s win had a similar vibe to the 2020 Super Bowl when the Chiefs staged a dramatic rally to stun San Francisco. All three of the Chiefs' recent Super Bowl wins came after being down 10 points.

The Buccaneers' victory in Super Bowl LV is the team's eighth straight win, extending a franchise record. Tampa Bay won its final four regular-season games before doubling that with four more wins
