        <p>The ring belonged to former New York Giants Linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who won the ring at the 1991 Super Bowl against the Buffalo Bills. 8 NFL contributes around $750,000 for 150 rings to be made. 
The rings are typically made of yellow or rose gold; the 2010 Packers broke tradition, opting for theirs to be set in platinum.  The Patriots’ Super Bowl LI rings featured 283 diamonds,  
Some 205 diamonds weighing 4.85 carats glittered in the NFL championship dazzler (the Patriot’s 2003 Super Bowl ring had 104 diamonds; the 2004 Super Bowl ring had 124 diamonds). Team owner Robert Kraft said he wanted this ring to outdo ones his earlier teams had received, and team officials proclaimed it was the “largest ring ever made.” 
Super Bowl rings are indeed crafted with real diamonds. What varies, however, is the amount of diamonds in the design. According to Sports-Rings, a team's ownership and management selects who will  
What are Super Bowl rings made of? For decades, Super Bowl rings were primarily made from gold and diamonds. However, the 2010 Green Bay Packers were the first team to have a ring set in platinum. But even Super Bowl rings can chip! Justin Coleman of the New England Patriots and his teammate were wearing their rings for the first time and gave  
It also contained 16 rubies in the logo depicting the number of division titles won and 3 marquise cut diamonds embedded above, symbolizing the number of Super Bowl titles won by the team. 
These Super Bowl rings’ designs have become progressively exquisite, featuring a one-carat diamond at the outset but comprising over 250 10.5-carat diamonds and 36 rubies at the last Super Bowl. Originally, Super Bowl rings primarily featured gold and diamond materials until 2010, when the Green Bay Packers opted for a platinum-based set of  
While there isn’t a hard-and-fast number to how much a Super Bowl ring is worth, depending on the circumstances and details of the ring, experts generally appraise them between $30,000 and  
The Chiefs' Super Bowl LIV ring featured a total of 9 baguette diamonds which total .9 carats, 2 marquise diamonds equaling .7 carats and 244 round diamonds for a total of 3.3 carats. The ring  
As the game has grown in popularity, the rings have become fancier: more diamonds and gemstones, more complex designs, and a lot more “wow” factor. Compare the first ring made in 1966 – it sported a single one-carat diamond – to the most recent one. The Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl in a 34-31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. 
Of course, the specific story on each year’s ring is always different. For example, the bezel of the Philadelphia Eagles ring for its Super Bowl LII victory depicts a single trick play known as the Philly Special through a “waterfall” of 127 diamonds, a number representing the total of the jersey numbers of the three players who executed it—running back Corey Clement (30), tight end  
The genuine Super Bowl rings handed out to the victors are made with real gold and diamonds, boosting their value to thousands and thousands of dollars—and that's just for the ring itself. Pair that ring with a specific Super Bowl champion, and you could be looking at rings worth over $200,000 . 
The price tag for these rings is off the charts! A Super Bowl LI ring made for a family member of Tom Brady fetched a record-breaking $344,927 at auction despite having fewer diamonds and being smaller than Brady’s ring. Even before considering the sentimental significance, these rings are costly! 
The other side of the ring has the Super Bowl LVI final score 23-20, the NFL Shield and Super Bowl LVI logo, and “WORLD CHAMPIONS” on a plate that mimics the shape of the Infinity Screen. The two diamonds on each side of the ring, totaling four stones, represent the four teams the Rams beat in the 2021 Postseason to win Super Bowl LVI.
