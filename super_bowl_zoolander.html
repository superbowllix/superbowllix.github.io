(CNN) — Derek Zoolander is back and, yes, he remains “really, really, really ridiculously good looking.” Ben Stiller — who first appeared as the vapid supermodel character in the 2001 movie “Zoolander” and the 2016 sequel — is blue steeling once again, this time for Pepsi’s new Super Bowl LVII ad, which was released on Wednesday.

Following a similar premise from Pepsi’s Super Bowl spots, Zoolander takes a drink of Pepsi Zero Sugar and claims it is “really, really ridiculously good tasting,” before asking viewers if he was just modeling-slash-acting.
