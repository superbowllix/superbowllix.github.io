Super Bowl octopus history. Through all 58 Super Bowl games to date, there has only been one octopus. That octopus came two years ago when Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts ran for a TD and then scampered in for the ensuing two-point conversion against the Chiefs in Super Bowl 57.

Special event games like the Super Bowl Octopus often feature enhanced odds; Promotional boosts during marquee matchups; Same-game parlay opportunities combining octopus with other props The mathematical probability suggests a 2.24% chance of occurrence in any game. 
The octopus has happened only 188 times since the two-point conversion was enacted in 1994. And until last year, it had never occurred in the Super Bowl. That was until Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts rushed for a TD and two-point conversion to tie the game up at 35 late in the game. Octopus tickets as long as +1400 cashed because of Hurts' dash. 
Between the octopus and the kick hitting the cross bar, the insane yes props are all cashing tonight. And we are live for OT, public is eating tonight. — Greg Peterson (@GUnit_81) February 13, 2023 
The octopus has yet to earn legendary status in the Super Bowl. But it has become a popular prop bet in recent years and doesn’t involve throwing the sea creature on the field. 
When the Chiefs faced the Eagles in Super Bowl 57, QB Jalen Hurts rushed for a touchdown and then again for the two-point conversion — a rare “octopus” (when a player accounts for all eight points). For years, sportsbooks offered odds on a player to score an octopus. 
The Philadelphia Eagles' return to the Super Bowl in 2025 has bettors everywhere talking about an octopus. No, this is not a real octopus. It's a not a nickname for a player (or at least not a  
According to Pro Football Reference, wide receivers Torrance Small and Rob Moore each tallied an octopus on Sept. 11, 1994, marking the first two ever recorded. Has there ever been an octopus in the Super Bowl? In recent years, sportsbooks have started offering the octopus as a Super Bowl prop bet and one cashed last year. 
Background Insights of the Octopus Bet. The Octopus has been a reality since the NFL introduced the two-point conversion back in 1994. This allowed a team the option of either kicking for the standard one-point conversion after a touchdown or risking another set of play from the two-yard line to get into the endzone once more. 
In Super Bowl 57, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts punched home the first octopus in the history of the Puppy Bowl Post-Game Show. It kicked off with a two-yard touchdown scamper before he darted in for the two-point conversion, knotting the score at 35 apiece in the last frame. 
Given the rare nature of this bet, DraftKings lists the likelihood of an octopus in Super Bowl LVIII between the Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers at +1400 odds. (The odds of it not hitting are a

Prior to attending Super Bowl 56 in Inglewood, California, Mitch Goldich, creator of the Octopus prop bet, told Props.com how this wager was born, and it’s underground cult-like following. 
If you're going to make a Super Bowl 58 Octopus bet, put some pizza money on it and hope for the best. For more context, the 49ers didn't try a two-point conversion this season. The Chiefs
