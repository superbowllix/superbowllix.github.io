        <p>The Lombardi Trophy is awarded annually to the winner of the Super Bowl, crowning that team as the NFL champion. It was first presented to the Green Bay Packers on Jan. 15, 1967, at the conclusion  
Here’s how Tiffany &amp; Co. came to create the first-ever Super Bowl Trophy for the NFL in 1966, plus how it’s made year after year. 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. [1] 
Considering the trophy is named after a perennial winner in Vince Lombardi, this design choice does convey the intended meaning. Another impressive factor about the Super Bowl trophy is the fact that the league allows it to remain with the winning team of that year for the rest of eternity. 
The iconic Vince Lombardi trophy, which is awarded to the winners of the Super Bowl each year, has an interesting history. It has been designed exclusively by Tiffany &amp; Co. since Super Bowl I in  
Following the Green Bay Packers’s victory in the first two Super Bowls (then dubbed the AFL-NFL World Championship Games), the World Championship Game Trophy was renamed for the Packers’s late  
We have made the iconic Vince Lombardi Trophy®, presented annually to the NFL® Super Bowl® championship team, since the first Super Bowl® in 1967. Oscar Riedener, a former Tiffany &amp; Co. Vice President, sketched the basic design for the trophy on a napkin during a 1966 meeting with then-NFL® Commissioner Pete Rozelle, and the rest was history. 
The trophy costs $50,000 to produce and takes four months and 72 hours of labor to complete. Do Players Get Their Own Super Bowl Lombardi Trophy? Due to the labor-intensive project to create the Lombardi Trophy, players don’t get to take one home that is an exact match. Instead, each player on the winning team gets to take home a small  
Let’s delve into the history, design, and significance of the Lombardi Trophy, exploring everything you need to know about the Super Bowl trophy. History of the Lombardi Trophy The Lombardi Trophy was first introduced in 1967, following the untimely death of Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to five NFL championships in the 1960s. 
The design has been the same for every Super Bowl. Every year Tiffany &amp; Co. handcrafts a new one to award the winning team.  For the first 29 Super Bowls, the trophy was awarded to the winning

The Super Bowl 59 logo reflects all these aspects, though its psychedelic design makes it challenging to see specific images linked to local landmarks. A standard template used in recent years served as the basis. As always, the Vince Lombardi Trophy stands at the center—the competition’s main prize, awarded to the winner since 1967. 
The logo was the first of its kind, as no other Super Bowl had involved the Lombardi Trophy in its design. And for the next 10 years, that – like just about everything else – would not change. 
Super Bowl Trophy wasn’t always the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Super Bowl trophy wasn’t always known as the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Originally, it was called the World Professional Football Championship Trophy. This name was used for the first few Super Bowls before it was changed in honor of Vince Lombardi after his untimely death in 1970. 
The trophy everyone dreams of hoisting at the end of the Super Bowl carries a name that wasn’t always its own. Discover the story behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, a tribute to a legendary coach.

The one thing that remains as Super Bowl LI is set to kick off a week from today is the design of the trophy. A regulation-sized football sits angled on what appears to be a stylized elongated and
