With the victory, the Jets were the only winning team to score only one touchdown (either offensive, defensive, or special teams) until the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII. Namath, who completed 17 out of 28 passes for 206 yards, was named as the Super Bowl's most valuable player , making him the first player in Super Bowl history to be  
As of December 2024, the last time the New York Jets won a Super Bowl was in 1969. It was Super Bowl III which was played at the Orange Bowl stadium in Miami, Florida. The Jets won the match 
The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three titles in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super Bowl titles. The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX , LI , and LIII for three titles in five seasons. 
The New York Jets defeating the then-Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III remains the biggest upset in Super Bowl history. The Colts were 18-point favorites before getting stunned by Broadway 
The Jets advanced to the AFL playoffs for the first time in 1968 and went on to compete in Super Bowl III where they defeated the Baltimore Colts, becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game. [9] 
The New York Jets last won the Super Bowl in the 1968 season. The Jets beat the Baltimore Colts 16-7 in the Super Bowl. 
In 1968, the Jets advanced to the playoffs for the first time and played in the first AFL-NFL championship game officially called the Super Bowl. Under quarterback Joe Namath, the Jets 
Along with the New Orleans Saints, the Jets have the distinction of being one of just two teams to have appeared in a single Super Bowl and walked away victorious. As heavy underdogs at Super Bowl III, the Jets represented the AFL with distinction as they defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts.

NEW ORLEANS – Two Super Bowl coordinators who were candidates for the Jets head coaching job said they were asked about Aaron Rodgers during their interviews. Kansas City offensive coordinator

In 2010, the New York Jets lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Conference Championship. What years did the Jets make the Super Bowl? The New York Jets have appeared in the Super Bowl once, in 1968. 
Nagy and Spagnuolo have been head coaches before. Nagy led the Bears from 2018-21 and went 34-31 with two playoff appearances. Spagnuolo was the Rams coach from 2009-11 and went a dismal 10-38. 
Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder's spread of 17.5 points for Super Bowl III was ludicrous. Snell, the Jets fullback, benefited from Boozer's calming nature in the days leading up to that Super Bowl in  
(The Colts allowed 10 or fewer points in 11 of their 14 victories leading up to the Super Bowl.) The Jets were quietly confident after a 27-23 victory over the Raiders in the AFL title game, but  
But the Jets were giant underdogs entering the Super Bowl. Sure, quarterback Joe Willie Namath was outstanding. But the AFL hadn’t proven much in the first two Super Bowls.
