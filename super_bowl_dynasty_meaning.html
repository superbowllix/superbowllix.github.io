        <p>If the Super Bowl trophy is named after you, you were probably a part of a dynasty at some point. He was the Green Bay Packers coach for nine years, finishing with a record of 98-30-4. 
Mr. Wray’s bar seems a bit low: If his informal definition of “dynasty” means three seasons of excellence which include either two Super Bowl/league championship wins or three championship appearances, some 24 teams would qualify – clearly too many. 
The 1992-95 Cowboys were a dynasty in the making after winning three Super Bowls in four seasons, but owner Jerry Jones fired coach Jimmy Johnson before the third Super Bowl victory. The chances  
Super Bowl Titles: 2 (Super Bowl 12 and 6). Key Players: Roger Staubach, Chuck Howley, Drew Pearson, Randy White, Bob Lilly, Rayfield Wright, Mel Renfro, John Niland; Legacy: Consistency with multiple playoff appearances; The 1970s Cowboys, also known as “America’s Team,” were known for their innovative play-calling and consistent playoff  
The Chiefs enter "dynasty" territory with a third Super Bowl win in the past five years. SN's Bill Bender looks at where the Chiefs' run ranks among the best stretches in NFL history. 
The best way to think about a dynasty in the NFL is to equate consistent winning with postseason and Super Bowl success over time. A team can’t have postseason success without a Lombardi Trophy  
This dynasty is usually considered to cover 1981 through 1989, a period in which the team won four Super Bowl championships (1981, 1984, 1988, 1989) and 8 division titles, [117] [119] [120] [121] but sometimes, the 1994 Super Bowl championship is also included due to the team's success through the 1980s and most of the 1990s. [122] [123] [124  
The Steelers' 1970s dynasty was interrupted only by the Raiders' first Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XI and the Cowboys' second Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XII. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Conversely, the Vikings, with their Purple People Eaters defense, were the only other team to appear in multiple Super Bowls (IV, VIII, IX and XI) during the decade but  
The concept of an NFL dynasty typically involves sustained success over a period, highlighted by multiple Super Bowl wins. The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers stand at the pinnacle  
With the Pittsburgh Steelers having just recently captured their second Super Bowl in four years and sixth overall, it seems like a good time to tackle one of the most subjective and contested  
We break down where the Kansas City Chiefs dynasty ranks among the best sports teams of all time ahead of Chiefs vs. Eagles in Super Bowl 2025. 
With their win in last year's Super Bowl, Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs officially became the NFL's latest dynasty. In Super Bowl LIX, the Chiefs can make more history while adding to  
Super Bowl LIX is just three days away and, as the collective sports world turns its attention on the big game, the usual superstars are taking center stage in New Orleans. Most levels of college football will be represented in some form or another when the Chiefs and Eagles clash on Sunday. 
** If the Chiefs win Super Bowl LIX . Each of the NFL's best Super Bowl dynasties has their own unique distinction. The Dolphins were the first team to play in three Super Bowls and boast the NFL  
Vince Wilfork played for two of New England’s six Super Bowl-winning teams, and he tells Athlon Sports that his Patriots would beat today’s Chiefs. Yes, you can call them a dynasty. But don  
The Kansas City Chiefs are back-to-back Super Bowl champions. Scott Van Pelt reflects on the dynasty-cementing season of Patrick Mahomes &amp; Co. 
17. Buffalo Bills (1988-1993) – Greatest NFL dynasty to never win a Super Bowl.  That would mean four Super Bowl rings in a six-year span, with the years the team fell short from 2018-2024  
“It’s a little bit surreal,” Reid said. “I don’t know what a dynasty is. You guys have the thesaurus, so you can figure it out.
