1976 — Pittsburgh wins the Super Bowl for the second straight year. Terry Bradshaw’s 64-yard touchdown pass to Lynn Swann and Glen Edwards’ interception on the last play of the game gives the Steelers a 21-17 win over the Dallas Cowboys. Swann, with four receptions for 161 yards, is the game’s MVP. 
Holmes caught nine passes for 131 yards and a touchdown, including four receptions for 73 yards on their final game-winning drive. He was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the sixth wide receiver to win the award, and also was the third Pittsburgh receiver to win the award, following Lynn Swann in Super Bowl X and Hines Ward in Super Bowl XL. 
Bradshaw led the team to four Super Bowl championships, being named MVP in Super Bowl XIII and XIV. He passed for 932 yards and nine touchdowns in the four Super Bowl victories and in 19 postseason games passed for 3,833 yards. 
Super Bowl XIII MVP Alternates. The Steelers' Lynn Swann: The Cowboys must have hated seeing Lynn Swann in the 1970s. He earned the MVP for his play in Super Bowl X, and while Bradshaw won the MVP for Super Bowl XIII, Swann was a good candidate as well with seven catches for 124 yards and a score. 
Game Recap and Key Highlights. Super Bowl XXX was a hard-fought game between two of the NFL’s most storied teams. The Cowboys struck first with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by Emmitt Smith in the first quarter, but the Steelers kept the game close with a field goal by Norm Johnson. 
Ben Roethlisberger finds Santonio Holmes for a spectacular grab in the corner of the end zone to give the Steelers the 27-23 Super Bowl XLIII win over the Cardinals. 
Super Bowl IX: Steelers RB Franco Harris. Tony Tomsic-Imagn Images. Franco Harris set what was then a Super Bowl record by rushing 34 times for 158 yards (4.65 per carry), which was more than the Vikings managed to gain on the ground and in the air the entire game thanks to the efforts of the stifling Steel Curtain defense. 
An MVP has been honored for every Super Bowl, but the trophy, which is named after longtime NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, was first given out at Super Bowl 25. And one player in this year’s Big  
Lynn Swaan had one of the Best Super Bowl performances of all time and he was awarded with being the first wide receiver to ever win a Super Bowl MVP. He racked up 161 yards and a touchdown on only 4 receptions; however, he had one of the most famous catches of all time with his balance and ball tracking skills being able to complete the reception. 
Mahomes enters Super Bowl 59 tied with Joe Montana for the second-most Super Bowl MVPs at three apiece. The only other players to win the award multiple times are Terry Bradshaw (2), Eli Manning  
The pinnacle is Super Bowl XIII, Bradshaw named MVP after 17-30 for 318 yards and 4 touchdowns. Overall, Bradshaw threw 9 TD to 4 INT in Super Bowls compared to 3 TD to 5 INT for Roethlisberger in  </p>
