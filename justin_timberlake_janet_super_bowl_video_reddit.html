        <h2><strong>justin timberlake janet super bowl video reddit la super bowl parade</strong></h2>
        <p>I heard this was basically a Leave Justin Alone piece and is it ever. “On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
I think she's forgiving him for the way the fallout was handled. Janet was lambasted and shamed, while Justin walked away without scrutiny. He abandoned her to accept the blame. He's since apologized for his cowardice and how it affected Janet's career and emotional health. So yeah, I think she has stuff to forgive him for 
Then he proceeded to make the Cry Me a River video which implied she cheated on him and stirred up a ton of drama. I don’t think people are saying her mental health is his fault, just that he’s another name on a long list of people who treated her like absolute garbage for attention. 
What happened in Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake’s Super Bowl halftime show in 2004? Was it staged? Revisit that infamous "wardrobe malfunction" in SLOW 
CONNECT WITH JANET'S GREEK NATION: video by Janet Jackson featur 
Timberlake returned to the Super Bowl halftime show in 2018 as a headliner, upsetting many including Jackson's father, Joe Jackson. "If he’s such a gentleman, he’d make sure Janet is there  
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple  
When pop star Justin Timberlake announced that he would headline the Super Bowl LII half-time show, airing this Sunday on NBC, he reignited discussion over his controversial appearance with Janet  
First, I love Janet Jackson, and I really enjoy Justin Timberlake. Both are people I’d love to meet, and both seem like genuinely nice people. On to my argument: Like many of you, I saw it live on tv. To this day, I cannot be convinced it was an accident. 
Editor's note: Part of the video below may be considered NSFW. Justin Timberlake will be headlining the 2018 Super Bowl halftime show.; The last time he performed at the Super Bowl was with Janet  
Another thing people forget is that Janet Jackson had been famous for at least eighteen years at at the time of the Super Bowl. She released Control in 1986 and the Super Bowl occurred in 2004. I remember her career being a little on the decline at this point. I never stopped letting Janet be a megastar. 
What is your argument for Janet being more talented and more deserving? Because she released music in the 80s and 90s? I guarantee you if Justin was making music then, he'd have the same number of, if not more, number ones than Janet. How about you actually provide a counterpoint instead of instantly dismissing an opinion different than yours? 
This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). I remember people being quite negative about him being picked in 2017 because it was assumed he and Janet were banned after the controversial 2004 performance - CBS officials would deny placing a ban on her. 
The Super Bowl was always weirdly conventional, but the commercials were all weirdly edgy. Two years earlier, there was that Coor’s Light Superbowl commercial that was a parody of Tom T Hall’s “I Love (Little Baby Ducks)” but the punchline is having threesome with twins (because lesbianism and incest are comparable, and both acceptable  
Justin, Janet, and several MTV execs and choreographers all decided they were going to do that, and they made up a ridiculous story when the reaction they got wasn't what they expected. But that said, yes, Janet pretty much lost her whole career while Justin went on to higher and higher levels of success, and that isn't fair at all. 
What people get angry about is his how he acted and what happened in the aftermath of the Super Bowl. While Janet Jackson was almost immediately disinvited and barred from the Grammys, forced to make a public apology, had film projects canceled, and was blacklisted from all CBS properties, Timberlake’s first public comment on it was “Hey

This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). I remember people being quite negative about him being picked in 2017 because it was assumed he and Janet were banned after the controversial 2004 performance - CBS officials would deny placing a ban on her. 
TIL that the term “wardrobe malfunction” was coined in 2004. Justin Timberlake first used it in an apology to Janet Jackson for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, where Jackson’s breast was exposed. Media began using the term, and eventually it was added to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary. 
She didn't plateau after the Super Bowl issue. She continued slowly tailing off like she had been doing for the prior decade and like most pop stars do. Hell, her next album sold 3 million copies. Meanwhile Justin Timberlake was 23 at the time, one of the most popular people on earth, and newly starting a solo career. </p>
