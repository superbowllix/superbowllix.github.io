        <p>The NFL could be undergoing some major changes in the near future and one of those changes could involve the date of the Super Bowl.. During an interview with Pat McAfee on Friday, Goodell was  
National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday he wants the league to move to fewer preseason games so the Super Bowl would fall on Presidents Day weekend, a three-day weekend. 
Fans may soon lose the worry of skipping work after the Super Bowl as NFL commissioner Roger Goodell floated the idea of moving the season finale to Presidents Day Weekend.. The move comes as  
Super Bowl Saturday? Having the big game one day earlier is apparently what over 80,000 fans want. High school student Frank Ruggeri, 18, of Palm Bay, Fla. started an online petition to move Super  
The NFL commissioner said the extension of the season would then move the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend with festivities built around the game on Sunday night. 
The Super Bowl has been played on the second Sunday in February since the schedule expanded to 17 games in 2021. Goodell says the NFL would slash the preseason schedule to two games and tack on an 18th regular season game. He thinks the league is good with the format it has now but views the potential change as a net positive. 
They estimated that nearly 16.1 million employees across the U.S. planned to miss work the day after Super Bowl 58, according to a survey of 1,192 Americans.  Over on Change.org, a petition  
As part of the change, the Super Bowl was pushed back from the first weekend of February to the second. 24/7 New York news stream: Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are "I think we're good at 17 now  
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell theorized last week the NFL could move to an 18-game schedule and push the Super Bowl to Presidents' Day weekend. 
Of course, Goodell's point is also completely valid and it's why the NFL will almost certainly never move the game from its current day. With the game on a Sunday, the Super Bowl has produced nine  
Super Bowl Day Off is a topic that highlights the call for making the day after the Super Bowl a national holiday in the United States. This movement aims to emphasize the significance of the Super Bowl as a major cultural event and create space for fans to recover from late-night festivities and enjoy the game. 
According to the NFL, the change led to 332 more returns in 2024 with the return rate increasing to 32.8%. There were also 59 returns of at least 40 yards, the most in the league since 2016, and  
If the represented team wins Super Bowl LIX, pre-orders will continue to be taken for this made-to-order item through Monday 2/24/2025 at 11:59pm PT.

The reason? My parental responsibilities require me to get my child home and ready for bed in preparation for school the next day. This means leaving any Super Bowl gathering early, missing out on key moments of the game, and not being able to fully participate in this annual tradition with friends and family

Campaign to change Super Bowl day to Saturday or give US a public holiday gathers momentum. More people will be able to enjoy the game argues a Florida student in his campaign 
The Super Bowl was first played in February in 2004, held on the first day of the month, for the XXXVIII edition of the game, between the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers. It was held on the first Sunday of the month until 2021, when it subsequently moved to 2022 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic with Super Bowl LVI. 
Typically, the weekend after Super Bowl Sunday is celebrated with a 3 day weekend thanks to the national holiday, President's Day. Why can't we combine the two? On average, 1.6 million people call out of work following the Super Bowl. 
And it isn’t on pace to be ready for MLB’s opening day. The Missouri Gaming Commission is working through the regulatory process, but staff are handling it alongside other duties. Missouri has missed out on revenue from sports betting during major events like the Super Bowl, but it’s a small amount in comparison to the state’s budget. </p>
