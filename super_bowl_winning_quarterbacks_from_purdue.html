        <h2><strong>super bowl winning quarterbacks from purdue ice spice flashing signs at super bowl</strong></h2>
        <p>This is a list of National Football League (NFL) quarterbacks who have started in the Super Bowl. Hall of Famers Bart Starr (top) and Len Dawson (bottom) started in the first Super Bowl for the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs respectively. 
Billy Dicken's time in West Lafayette saw him excel as a dual-threat quarterback, boasting impressive arm strength and athleticism. His competitive fire manifested itself on the field, helping lead Purdue to its first bowl win in over a decade in the 1997 Alamo Bowl. 
Griese is one of three quarterbacks from Purdue to win the Super Bowl (along with Len Dawson and Drew Brees). James Samuel Everett III (born January 3, 1963) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons, primarily with the Los Angeles Rams. 
And with Drew Brees, Dawson and Griese as Super Bowl champion quarterbacks, Purdue is one of just two universities that can claim three Super Bowl champs at the position. (The other is Alabama with Bart Starr, Ken Stabler and Joe Namath.) 
[104] [105] When Drew Brees led the New Orleans Saints to a victory in Super Bowl XLIV, Purdue became just the second college in history to produce 3 different Super Bowl winning quarterbacks. The first Purdue quarterback to win an NFL title was Cecil Isbell who led the Green Bay Packers to the 1939 NFL title . 
Quarterback Drew Brees was named MVP of Super Bowl XLIV after his New Orleans Saints defeated the Indianapolis Colts 31-17. Brees completed 32 of 39 passes for 288 yards and two touchdowns. With Dawson, Griese and Brees, Purdue is one of just two schools that can claim three Super Bowl champion quarterbacks (also Alabama). 
Purdue University quarterbacks have made a tremendous impact on the NFL. The schools has produced Super Bowl champions such as Len Dawson and Drew Brees. 
Super Bowl winning quarterbacks from Purdue include Len Dawson, Bob Griese, and Drew Brees. But it's crucial to remember that while these examples highlight significant success, the path to NFL stardom and a Super Bowl appearance doesn't solely depend on the school you choose. 
Behind Alabama and Purdue with two quarterbacks who started and won Super Bowls are BYU, Notre Dame, and Stanford. In addition to Michigan and Arizona, there are 17 other schools whose 
3 Purdue quarterbacks who won a Super Bowl? Updated: 10/19/2022. Wiki User. ∙ 14y ago. Study now. See answer (1) Best Answer. Copy. Len Dawson, Bob Griese, Drew  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks of the 1970s, Griese led the Dolphins to a then record three consecutive Super Bowl appearances, [1] including two Super Bowl victories in VII and VIII, [2] [3] the first of which capped off Miami's undefeated and untied 1972 season, the only such season in NFL history. 
However, when discussing Super Bowl quarterbacks, one name stands above the rest—Tom Brady. The University of Michigan standout has started in a record 10 Super Bowls, winning seven. Brady, drafted in the sixth round by the New England Patriots, defied expectations and became the most successful quarterback in Super Bowl history. 
Alabama and Purdue each have three alums who have won the Super Bowl starting under center.  but the Alabama Crimson Tide and Purdue Boilermakers have the most Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks  
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Not only does Purdue Football have a rich history in the NFL, but also in the league's biggest game. That tradition continues Sunday (Feb. 11) as George Karlaftis and the Kansas City Chiefs take on Jalen Graham and the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII (6:30 p.m. ET on CBS). 
How many Super Bowl winning starting quarterbacks has your school produced? How many wins can they each brag about? That's going to mean something different in the near future with all the transfers and movements in the college game - Wisconsin gets credit for Russell Wilson, not NC State, and of course UCLA can claim Troy Aikman, not Oklahoma - but it's all fairly obvious. 
Joe Montana remains for many the standard-bearer of championship NFL quarterback play, winning four Super Bowls with the 49ers (XVI, XIX, XXIII, XXIV), while Joe Theismann won Super Bowl XVII with  
Jalen Hurts has held a press conference every day this week in the build-up to the Super Bowl and the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback has somehow managed to keep his name out of the headlines  
Notre Dame and Stanford quarterbacks have started more Super Bowls than any other school, with seven; Purdue has six; Michigan has five; and Alabama, Louisiana Tech, Miami, Navy and UCLA have four  
As of 2023, Alabama and Purdue are tied for first in producing the most number of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks. [1] As of September 2017, the top five universities in terms of the most NFL quarterback passing yards were 219,064 for Purdue , 183,296 for Notre Dame , 157,855 for USC , 152,627 for Stanford and 142,524 for Washington . </p>
