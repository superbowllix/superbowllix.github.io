        <p>The 1920 Akron Pros were named the first APFA (NFL) champions. The National Football League champions, prior to the merger between the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL) in 1970, were determined by two different systems. The National Football League was established on September 17, 1920, as the American Professional Football Association (APFA). The APFA changed  
The Green Bay Packers have won the most NFL championship titles with 13 (nine pre-Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls, including the first two AFL-NFL World Championship Games). The Chicago Bears have won the second most overall championships with nine (eight pre-Super Bowl era and one Super Bowl) and the New York Giants have won the third most  
This is a list of National Football League (NFL) champions before the 1970 AFL–NFL merger. From 1920–1932, the league champion was determined by a team's win–loss percentage, with tied games omitted.[1] In 1932, because of a tie in the final standings, a playoff game was played to determine the championship.[2] In 1933, the NFL played its first official championship game.[2] On July 31  
Imagine if we separated Major League Baseball World Series titles the same way that we separate NFL Championships, pre-1966, from Super Bowl titles. The Dodgers have won five MLB crowns in the city of Los Angeles, but only two since the start of the Super Bowl era. (They lost three Series alone in the 1970s — what a disappointment! 
13 players have won 5 championships counting the pre-Super Bowl era; with the exception of Charles Haley, all were from the 1960s Packers. Bart Starr (quarterback) won the NFL championships with the Green Bay Packers in 1961, 1962 and 1965, Super Bowls I and II with the Packers after the 1966 and 1967 seasons. 
The history of the NFL dates back much farther than the Super Bowl, which was first played in 1967. Indeed, the NFL was founded in 1920, when teams from four states—Ohio, Indiana, New York and Illinois—came together to form the American Professional Football Association, according to NFL.com. The group changed its name to the NFL in 1922. 
However, the NFL Record &amp; Fact Book lumps all NFL Championship games in with the NFC Championship results. For a composite list of Super Bowls and pre-Super Bowl era championships, click here.

The first four Super Bowls served as inter-league championship games because of these inter-league championship games this created some confusion amongst football fans that there was a special World Championship series in the pre-merger era. After the merger, the Super Bowl became the NFL's championship game. 
But the Eagles managed a single touchdown to come out on top, 7-0. It remains the lowest-scoring championship game, pre and post-Super Bowl era, in NFL history. 7. 1963: Chicago Bears 14, New York Giants 10. This particular edition of the championship, the third-last before the Super Bowl era, was played under the backdrop of tragedy. 
From iconic teams like the Green Bay Packers and Cleveland Browns dominating during the pre-Super Bowl era to recent dynasties within the past two decades. Here are the 20 most dominant NFL  
On January 31, 1988, he became the first black quarterback to start in the Super Bowl, and a few hours later, the first to win it, ironically wearing the Super Bowl ring of the last team in the league to integrate black players. [28] Williams threw for 340 yards and four touchdowns–Super Bowl records at the time–and was named Super Bowl MVP. 
The Bears–Giants rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants.The rivalry was notable for the six NFL championship games between the two teams before the creation of the Super Bowl, and the two subsequent Super Bowl-era playoff meetings that involved two of the NFL's greatest defensive units: the Bears' 46 defense crew helmed by Buddy  
Nowadays winning the AFC/NFC championship means as much as winning a pre-merger championship. I think how the Super Bowl has become a bigger spectacle and arguably the biggest sporting event in the US makes it a more fulfilling and spectacular accomplishment than winning a championship in a much smaller league with less national influence. 
The four NFL championships between 1966-69 (as in pre-merger but during the Super Bowl era) tend to be forgotten - especially the 1968 Colts and 1969 Vikings, since they went on to lose the SB in embarrassing fashion. 
Cleveland Browns quarterback Otto Graham dominated professional football in the pre-Super Bowl era. From 1946-55, "Automatic Otto" led the Browns to 10 straight championship games—an achievement

If you look at NFL history prior to the Super Bowl, teams such as the Browns and Lions have pretty successful histories. However, many NFL fans tend to ignore all history prior to the Super Bowl, essentially pretending that professional football didn’t exist before the 1966 season. 
The Giants are one of the oldest and most successful teams in the NFL. They have four Super Bowl rings and four pre-Super Bowl era championships. Read about the team's history, coaches, memorable  </p>
