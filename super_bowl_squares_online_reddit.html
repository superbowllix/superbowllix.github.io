        <p>Love this! I keep getting asked at work if i’m doing squares and this would make life easier and more fun for everyone since it keeps track of current winners. I do agree with the comment about maybe being able to toggle the visibility of the numbers once all squares are marked paid for. Other than that, it’s perfect! 
The Fantasy Football Commissioners of Reddit Members Online  My Free Super Bowl Squares App is now live and open to the public! Here's a quick demo of how it works. 
Squares are assigned at random out of a hat or something. Say Bob's name was the third one chosen out of the hat. His square would be the third one from the left on the top row. Say the final score of any given quarter was 49ers 32, chiefs 30. Bob wins the payout for that quarter. Say each square is sold for $20. There are 100 squares.

It’s simple: you pick squares on a 10×10 grid, and the winning square is determined by the last digit of each team’s score at the end of a quarter or the game. Here’s how it works, including the best numbers to choose, payout suggestions, and a free template to get started. How Do Super Bowl Squares Work? 
Create Super Bowl Squares Super Bowl 59 is officially scheduled to kick off on Sunday, February 9th 2025 at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Get started on your football squares contest for the biggest football game of the year. 
The worst Super Bowl squares numbers would be 2, 5 or 9. Unlike the best numbers, these require a little more work to get to. If things get weird in New Orleans, you might be in luck then. 
Super Bowl squares is a simple game played for fun during the Big Game. The game is played on a 10x10 grid, with each axis being assigned to one of the two competing teams. 
How do Super Bowl squares work? The game requires a 10-by-10 grid with digits 0-9 on both axes, forming 100 squares correlating to those digits. Using this year’s Super Bowl as an example, the  
If you are looking for the best squares, the ones with 7-0 and 3-0 have been picked 20 times in Super Bowl history, according the Print Your Brackets, the most of any squares. Second with 19  
Your friends’ 20% does seem a bit greedy. Think of it this way- a square organizer will collect thousands and have to keep track of the money, they’re responsible for keeping it safe and delivering it the day after Super Bowl. That 10% is also insurance. If the squares don’t fill up, you have to buy the rest or return everyone’s money. 
I usually buy five squares if I am going to play a board because I feel it gives you the most bang for your buck. I avoid the four corners at all costs because those never seem to hit. If I have one on the edge, I like to be either 2 or 3 spaces from the corner. I also don't like to have any of my squares touching, either by adjacency or  
It's gambling. You are trying to get the two numbers in your square to equal the last number of the score. Some do final score, others do at the end of every quarter as well as reverse final score. Typically the sheet starts off blank. In this case there are 100 squares total. You "buy" a square.

My dad had a pool where he works and I bought my own square through him. It was a 25 square board, $100 a square, and $500 went to each person who won the first three quarters and $1000 to the person who got the final score (me, in this case). On the paper, it says exactly that. $500 each for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quarters. $1000 for final score.

So, I was invited to participate in an office Super Bowl grid. $20 bucks a square. Sure, why not. Makes for a more interesting game if the game is a blowout or the commercials stink. Anyway, the woman who invited me apologized, she said she tried to get to me earlier but at this point there was only one "inside" square left.
