        <h2><strong>super bowl teams that have won super bowl radio channel number</strong></h2>
        <p>There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year.

More than a third of the teams in the NFL have never won a Super Bowl, and four franchises have never even appeared the title game. Here’s the full team-by-team rundown of Super Bowl victories  
The Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers both have 5 Super Bowl wins but neither team has won since the mid-1990s. The 49ers reached the Super Bowl in 2012 and 2019 but lost to the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs in those contests. The Dallas Cowboys haven’t reached a Super Bowl since they won the title back in 1995. 
The Patriots have appeared in the Super Bowl 11 times, the most of any NFL team. The San Francisco 49ers , Denver Broncos , Dallas Cowboys and Steelers are tied for the second-most with eight  
Pittsburgh was the first team to win three, four and six Super Bowls, winning the sixth and most recent one at the end of the 2008 season. The Steelers had a chance to win a seventh Super Bowl  
Which teams have never won a Super Bowl? Out of the 32 active teams in the NFL, 12 have never won the Super Bowl. They are the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers, Minnesota Vikings and Tennessee 
The Super Bowl locations, dates, losing teams, and final scores are also included (1967-2024).  A total of 12 NFL teams have never won the Super Bowl. This list includes: Cleveland Browns  
Of the 12 teams that have never won the Super Bowl, four are expansion clubs younger than it. Who has won the Super Bowl 7 times? With how many Super Bowl rings does an NFL player have? Tom Brady is the name of the quarterback. Brady is often referred to as the best of all time (G.O.A.T. if you will). There’s a reason for that. 
The Kansas City Chiefs are looking to accomplish something no NFL franchise has before when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2025 Super Bowl. After winning the last two Super Bowls

The Chiefs lost Super Bowl 1 and won Super Bowl 4 before enduring a 50-year championship game hiatus. The Chiefs have now appeared in the Super Bowl five times in the last six seasons. 
That is even more crazy when you think about how 12 NFL teams have never won even one Super Bowl. Let’s take a look at those 12 teams and see how close they’ve come to getting off this list. 
Of those 12 franchises, only two have appeared in four Super Bowls: the Bills and Vikings. The Falcons, Panthers, and Bengals each have two Super Bowl appearances as well. The Cardinals, Chargers, and Titans have all appeared in one Super Bowl. However, four teams have never even played in the Super Bowl: the Browns, Lions, Texans, and Jaguars. 
Of the 28 franchises to have played in a Super Bowl, 20 have actually won a championship. And a whopping 30 of the 56 Super Bowls have been won by just six franchises. 
Kansas City would join Pittsburgh, New England, San Francisco and Dallas as the only teams with Vince Lombardi trophies. Kansas City won its first Super Bowl back in 1970 in what was the final  
Two NFL teams have won the Super Bowl a record six times, the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Patriots' last title was 2018. 
The Browns have one of the most passionate fan bases in the NFL, but they have yet to make an appearance. Cleveland was a dominant franchise in the pre-Super Bowl era, winning multiple NFL championships in the 1950s and early 1960s, led by legends like Otto Graham and Jim Brown.
