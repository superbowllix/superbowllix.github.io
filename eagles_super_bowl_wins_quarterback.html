        <h2><strong>eagles super bowl wins quarterback nfl super bowl 2025 viewers</strong></h2>
        <p>Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons. A member of six teams, he achieved his greatest success with the Philadelphia Eagles, leading the franchise to their first Super Bowl title. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33  Philadelphia had overcome a late-season ACL tear by QB Carson Wentz and  
Philadelphia's first Super Bowl appearance was a 27-10 loss to the then-Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 15.Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett threw for three touchdowns while Eagles signal-caller Ron  
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
The first quarterback to lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl title, Foles made history in more ways than one, also becoming the first player to throw and catch a touchdown in the same game in Super  
Way back following the 1980 season, QB Ron Jaworski helped his team cruise to a Super Bowl berth, but the Eagles were embarrassed by the Raiders in a 10-27 loss. From there Philly had a long  
The 35-year-old Foles was a third-round pick by the Eagles in 2012 and played five years over two stints in Philadelphia. Foles made the Pro Bowl in 2013 after throwing seven touchdown passes in a  
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles (9) holds his daughter, Lily James, after winning the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game against the New England Patriots, Sunday, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis. 
Carson Wentz once again will mostly be a spectator on the sidelines during a Super Bowl appearance by the Philadelphia Eagles. Seven years after he watched his backup Nick Foles win the MVP after delivering the Eagles their first Super Bowl title, Wentz is back on the big stage as a backup to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes as the Chiefs prepare to take on his former team and his former backup  
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles

Other Notable Asst.: John DeFilippo (Quarterbacks), Ken Flajole (Linebackers), Mike Groh (Wide Receivers), Press Taylor (Off. Quality Control/Asst. Quarterbacks) and Cory Undlin (Defensive Backs) Stadium: Lincoln Financial Field 
How Many Super Bowls Have the Eagles Played In? Super Bowl 15 — January 1981; Super Bowl 39 — February 2005; Super Bowl 52 — February 2018; Super Bowl 57 — February 2023; Although the Eagles have appeared in four Super Bowls, they also made several championship appearances in the pre-Super Bowl era.

The Eagles already have their franchise quarterback, and NFL teams always have a deep appreciation for signal-callers who have Super Bowl wins on their resumes. The reality is that Foles is surely  
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles  
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will compete in Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, with kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. There have been a lot of  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. </p>
