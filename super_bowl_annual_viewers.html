While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until

That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
Fox has high standards to live up to as it broadcasts Super Bowl LIX this year. On top of the Super Bowl debut of Tom Brady (as a broadcaster, of course), the prior two games set viewership records.
