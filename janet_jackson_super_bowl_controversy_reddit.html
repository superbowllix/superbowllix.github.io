        <h2><strong>janet jackson super bowl controversy reddit super bowl results each quarter</strong></h2>
        <p>“On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
The Super Bowl was always weirdly conventional, but the commercials were all weirdly edgy. Two years earlier, there was that Coor’s Light Superbowl commercial that was a parody of Tom T Hall’s “I Love (Little Baby Ducks)” but the punchline is having threesome with twins (because lesbianism and incest are comparable, and both acceptable  
I’ve always wondered where Janets career would have been had the Super Bowl incident not have happened. We all know how bias the media is against women and especially women of color, being most evident in JT taking 0% of the blame and having Janets legacy nearly erased over 1 mistake. 
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple

The half time shows at Super Bowls have grown more and more spectacular over the years, and Super Bowl XXXVIII topped them all. As Justin Timberlake sang "Rock Your Body" onstage with Janet

Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake perform during the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII between the New England Patriots and the Carolina Panthers on Feb. 1, 2004 in Houston. 
It was Timberlake, after all, who along with Janet Jackson at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show gave birth to the phrase “wardrobe malfunction’’ and together were embroiled in “Nipplegate 
In 2004, a planned "costume reveal" went awry during the Super Bowl halftime show. Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake's careers took different turns after the backlash to the event.

Generally I don't need to be convinced that people are willing to shit on women for anything sexual. But Janet Jackson was almost 40 at the time and her sales and popularity peaked in the early 90's. She didn't plateau after the Super Bowl issue. She continued slowly tailing off like she had been doing for the prior decade and like most pop

FX and Hulu set to launch ‘Malfunction: The Dressing Down of Janet Jackson’ on Nov. 19. It tells the story of 2004 halftime show, “which saw Timberlake briefly expose Jackson’s breast to millions. Jackson’s career never recovered but Timberlake went from strength-to-strength.” 
It wasn't Janet Jackson's fault more of the blame should've been placed on Timberlake and the costume designer. It also fucked the Superbowl halftime show as they have been nowhere as good as they were in the early 2000s. 
An older lady had invited us over to have a super bowl party and watch the game on her big screen. When that happened the youth pastor just covered his face with his hands and ran out of the room lol 
So, it was unexpected. People were upset because kids watch the Super Bowl. I think many people who don't watch the Super Bowl any way didn't understand the big deal either way. I"m a huge Janet Jackson fan and the whole thing was kind of troublesome for many reasons. 
Janet Jackson says she and Justin Timberlake are 'very good friends' despite Super Bowl controversy: 'He and I have moved on' 
But if you watched the Hulu documentary the producer revealed Justin did the pull off several counts early. So he messed up, the producers didn’t cut to black soon enough when they realized it went wrong and obviously scum bag Moonves orchestrated an misogynistic and racist fueled black out and attempt at erasing her from pop culture history.
