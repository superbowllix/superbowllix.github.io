        <h2><strong>super bowl iii hero super bowl sunday halftime show 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl III was an American football championship game played on January 12, 1969, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. It was the third AFL–NFL Championship Game in professional American football, and the first to officially bear the trademark name " Super Bowl ". [ 3 ] 
Almost every recollection of Super Bowl III begins and ends with Joe Namath. As they should. Namath commanded all the attention 50 years ago on that Jan. 12, 1969 day in Miami's Orange Bowl. 
Namath cemented his legacy in 1969 when he guaranteed his heavy underdog Jets would win Super Bowl III before defeating the NFL's Baltimore Colts in one of the greatest sports upsets of all time. The Super Bowl victory was the first for an AFL franchise, helping dismiss notions that its teams were inferior to the NFL's and demonstrating they  
Besides all that, Namath is a superb quarterback who in the Super Bowl last week proved that his talent is as big as his mouth—which makes it a very big talent, indeed. He went from Broadway Joe to Super Joe on a cloud-covered afternoon in Miami, whipping the Baltimore Colts, champions of the National Football League, 16-7 in the process. 
Dave Herman, a guard who was moved to right tackle before the game, has been called the unsung hero of Super Bowl III. The 6-1, 255-pound Herman's work against 6-7, 275-pound Colts defensive end  
Joe Namath, Super Bowl III. Namath might be the biggest hero in Super Bowl history. His team was a 19.5-point underdog, but that didn’t stop him from guaranteeing victory over the Colts. Of course, he delivered and was able to back up his promise. 
Following Super Bowl III, for example, in 1969 alone, he: published a book, I Can’t Wait Until Tomorrow (co-written with sports writer, Dick Schaap); launched The Joe Namath TV Show of sports talk and related guests, co-hosted with Dick Schapp; appeared in TV and print advertising; and also began taking film roles in Hollywood and for  
Our condolences to family and friends of former Jet, Jim Hudson. He was a Super Bowl III hero, w/ key INT and 6 tackles. He will be missed. — New York Jets (@nyjets) June 27, 2013. 
In a story on Super Bowl III for Sports Illustrated the week after the event, Tex Maule called Namath "the folk hero of the new generation" whose persona "spells insouciant youth in the jet age."1 The contrast Namath provided against Baltimore's Unitas was as great and symbolic as that between their team's nicknames. 
Joe Namath is the hero of Super Bowl III - but the win is a triumph of the entire Jets team, which upsets the Baltimore Colts in Miami, Jan. 12, 1969.
