NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen.

The Chiefs and 49ers reached an estimated 123.7 million viewers on CBS's broadcast of Super Bowl 58 on Sunday night, as quarterback Patrick Mahomes completed a game-winning touchdown pass to  
The longest Super Bowl game will also go down as the most-watched program in U.S. television history.

That shattered last year’s mark of 115.1 million for  
Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday night drew 123.7 million viewers across all platforms, marking an all-time audience record for a single program on U.S. airwaves, per fast-national figures.

The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until
