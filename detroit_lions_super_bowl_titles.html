        <p>In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. The first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, so Detroit's championships do not count as Super Bowl  
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. The closest they came to winning a Super Bowl was in 1991 and 2023 when they lost the Conference Championship. Detroit Lions Pages 
The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships  
The Lions won four NFL Championship Games between 1935 and 1957. Following the 1957 championship, the franchise did not win a playoff game until the 1991 season and did not win another until the 2023 season. They are the only franchise operational for the entirety of the Super Bowl era to not appear in the Super Bowl. [8] [9] 
The Lions last played for an NFL title in 1957, demolishing the Browns, 59-14 for the championship for the third time in the 1950s. The Lions also beat the Browns for the NFL title in 1952 and '53  
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, the Detroit Lions have won the NFL Championship 4 times, most recently in the 1957 season. 
The Detroit Lions have not yet won a Super Bowl, as of December 2024. Get detailed information on Detroit Lions Super Bowl Appearances, their championships wins and much more on Sportskeeda. 
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. The Lions also lost the 1954 NFL Championship in their quest for a three-peat. 
4-1 in pre-Super Bowl championships: Detroit does have championship history in football, but it has been 67 years. The Lions won their first championship in 1935 over the New York Giants. The  
The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX. 
The Super Bowl Drought. Since then, the Lions have had no championship or title. This is one of the longest droughts across all four major American sports. 66 years in the making, the Detroit Lions are poised to hang a banner up at Ford Field this season and capture their first-ever Super Bowl title. 
Former Lions CB still has love for Detroit as he hunts Super Bowl title Analyst: Why the Lions can go all-in and target Myles Garrett Australia to host first NFL regular season game in 2026 
But, they have no Super Bowl wins. Understanding the Lions’ journey is key. They have faced many challenges in their quest for a championship. Even with their past successes, they still dream of winning the ultimate title. A Brief History of the Detroit Lions’ Super Bowl Journey. The Detroit Lions started in 1930. 
All paths lead to New Orleans and the Caesars Superdome on Feb. 9 with the Super Bowl, a game the Detroit Lions have never played in — the lone NFC team with the distinction and the only NFL  
This also remains as the Lions' fourth and most recent league title and most recent championship appearance (including the Super Bowl) as of 2024, starting a sixty-seven year championship drought for the Lions, which is currently the fourth-longest championship drought in the four major North American sports leagues. [13] 
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. 
The Detroit Lions have never reached the Super Bowl in their history. How many Super Bowl titles have the Detroit Lions won? As the Detroit Lions have not reached the Super Bowl, they are yet to win it. Between 1935 and 1957, the Lions won four NFL Championship Games, all before the Super Bowl. Since winning the championship in 1957, the  
I studied closely the Chiefs’ two rings — from Super Bowl IV and LIV — because I grew up in suburban Kansas City. I also spent a decent amount of time at an interactive kiosk. Fans could design a digital Super Bowl ring for their favorite team. There were several designs to choose from, all with diamonds and logos and “Super Bowl  
An early Super Bowl prediction. I had the Lions winning the NFC and facing the Kansas City Chiefs in my preseason Super Bowl prediction, and I don’t see much reason to change that now. The Lions are the best team in the NFC and they have the best non-weather-related homefield advantage in all of football. </p>
