        <p>The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
Super Bowl History For Spread And Totals Betting. Historical data shows that Super Bowl winners almost always cover the spread. A comprehensive look at past winners reveals this trend to be a constant, as the eventual winner has covered the spread in nine of the last 10 games, and 17 of the past 20. 
Here is a look at every Super Bowl spread and total (if available) since 1967 when the first Super Bowl was played. I have listed which team won the game with the score, and most importantly with the ATS winner, as well as the result of the over/under. 
Super Bowl LVIII Over/Under Result: Under 47.5. For many bettors, even Mecole Hardman’s game-winning touchdown in overtime wasn’t enough to get a winning result on the over. However, Hardman’s championship clincher was huge for Super Bowl over/under bettors who either had better timing or bet on an alternate total. 
Favorites are 28-28-2 in the 58 Super Bowls that have been contested. The UNDER is 29-28 in Super Bowl betting history. There was no total posted for Super Bowl 1. This year's Big Game will be a  
In the 2019 Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. The three points by the Rams matched an all-time low in the big game, matching the Miami Dolphins from way back in Super Bowl VI. 
Super Bowl betting trends show tight ATS and O/U results. Favorites are 28-27-2 in the 57 Super Bowls that have been contested. The OVER and UNDER are deadlocked at 28-28 in Super Bowl betting  
Here's a look at the past Super Bowl Over/Under history: Super Bowl LVI: Under (49.5 – Rams 23, Bengals 20) Super Bowl LV: Under (56 – Buccaneers 31, Chiefs 9) Super Bowl LIV: Under (53  
There have been 57 Super Bowls in NFL history and the favorite is 35-21 straight up with one pick ’em game (Super Bowl XLI between the 49ers and Bengals). The favorite is 25-28-3 ATS, with the straight-up winner as the ATS winner in Super Bowl XLI. With 56 lined totals in the Super Bowl, the Over is 28-27-1, with the push coming in Super Bowl  
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
Recent Super Bowl Over/Under History. The Under has been the play lately, hitting in five of the last six Super Bowls. The Under barely hit last year, however, and the 2023 game between the Chiefs  
Highest Total (Over/Under): The highest total (over/under) in the Super Bowl was 58.5 points in Super Bowl 58.5, when the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34-28 in overtime. Lowest Total (Over/Under): 33 is the lowest total posted for the Super Bowl and it has happened four times: XXXV: Giants vs Ravens 
The OVER is 10-6-1 on the National Anthem dating back to Super Bowl 41. Super Bowl National Anthem Prediction. We have a somewhat recent example of Jon Batiste performing the National Anthem at a  
This is a rematch of Super Bowl LVII when the Chiefs posted a 38-35 win over the Eagles in Glendale, Ariz., Feb. 12, 2023. Kansas City is 4-2 all time in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs lost Super Bowl I to the Green Bay Packers 35-10 in Los Angeles Memorial Stadium Jan. 15, 1967. 
One of the most popular bets is the Super Bowl over under, which focuses on the combined total score of both teams. Let's delve into the recent history of this particular wager and explore the results of the last five Super Bowls. 
If you’re looking to cash a bet before Super Bowl 59 even begins, then betting on the National Anthem length may be the one for you. Betting on whether the National Anthem will go over a set number of seconds has grown in popularity in recent years, and this year won’t be any different. 
The highest total in Super Bowl history was the famed 28-3 game against the Patriots. That total was 57 pre-game. The over hit thanks to James White 's overtime touchdown, but they were on 56 points at the end of regulation. 
Super Bowl LIX takes place on Sunday, February 9, 2025, where the two-time defending champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, will face the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles.This is a rematch of Super Bowl LVII from 2023, where we saw the Chiefs win that matchup 38-33. 
As Jon Batiste takes the stage for Super Bowl LIX, the clock begins—long before kickoff, before the first snap, before history unfolds. Oddsmakers set his national anthem Over/Under at 120.5 seconds (-122 Over / +100 Under), and by January 29, the Over had moved to -142, the Under to +114. 
Super Bowl Over Under History. The Super Bowl over-under has gone an even 27-27 over the years. This is both a testament to just how good Vegas is at picking these numbers and how evenly matched the majority of Super Bowls have been over the years. The first Super Bowl did not have an over-under, hence there being records of just 54 Super Bowls  </p>
