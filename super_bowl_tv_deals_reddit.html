        <h2><strong>super bowl tv deals reddit where to watch super bowl in detroit</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl is generally the worst time of year to buy a TV. It’s been that way for awhile. Some TVs will be on sale but it’ll vary. The best time of year is always the month of November and then April-July when the newer models replace the old. 
The deals you see more often are your 65" mid-ranger or below for $399 or $499. It's the "I want a big TV for the big game at a good price" sale. Don't think you'll get much better than now, but worst case scenario, of something does do discounts, places usually price match within the return window (like Best Buy), so you're golden. 
Last year I was able to get several insane deals due to Slickdeals alerts. I'd return the U7K, and look for better options like the X90L. You typically don't want to go any lower than that if you want a quality Sony Full Array LCD.

LG 65-inch C4 OLED 4K TV: was $2,699.99 now $1,499.99 at Best Buy. Best Buy's Super Bowl TV sale has dropped LG's 65-inch C4 OLED TV to $1,499.99. That's a massive $1,200 discount and only $100

So I'm looking into getting an LG C2 soon(ish), and I can't decide whether I should wait until closer to Super Bowl for the apparent "sale prices". Or just wait a bit longer til the Spring when new models come out and last years model prices drop. 
Plus, check out extensive guide to the best Super Bowl TV deals, as well as how to watch the Super Bowl. Quick Links. Crock-Pot 7-Quart Slow Cooker: was $49 now $34 @ Amazon; 
Was curious what TV deals everyone is watching for between now and then next 2020 lineup of new TVs (Spring). I have my eyes on LG B9 OLED. Hoping to get closer to 1k brand new while watching open box deals from Best buy. 
During the conversation, I asked if they knew if or when the annual Super Bowl tv sales would start and what tvs would likely go on sale. He told me they weren't expecting much of a Super Bowl sale this year due to a number of factors including: Increased demand for tvs due to the pandemic with people stuck at home. 
Black Friday and Super Bowl are the best TV sales. This year Black Friday was Black November as the best sales were all month long. The Vizio for under $500 is the best under $500 TV Costco has at the moment. 
Probably won't be much of a drop in brand new TVs. Might even be more expensive since they aren't running big promotional deals. However if you are willing to take an Open Box return I'd expect that the week after the Super Bowl is a prime time to find a large selection of open box TV returns, and stores would be motivated to get rid of them. 
There should be some good deals on TVs coming soon because of the Super Bowl and because CES started this week too. All the tv manufacturers are announcing their upcoming models which means current ones will start to drop in price. 
It's a good deal compared to the non-sale price. $1,699 for the 65" C2 was the black friday/holiday price. If you want it then get it for sure now.

The Super Bowl isn’t much of a sales event anymore. Some TVs (only a few) will be around the Black Friday pricing but the rest won’t be close at all. Your best bet every year is the month of November. After that it’s April-July when the new models start replacing the old. u/FeistyAgency9994, that doesn’t happen much anymore. I wouldn  </p>
