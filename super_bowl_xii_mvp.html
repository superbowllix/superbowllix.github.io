        <p>Super Bowl XII provided an opportunity for Morton to not only beat his former team, but also to redeem himself for his Super Bowl V loss and the loss of his starting job to Staubach. For Staubach, he had a chance to win his second Super Bowl and defeat his old rival, showing that he truly was the better quarterback of the two.

Quarterbacks have earned the honor 33 times in 58 games (and 59 awards). [12]

Super Bowl XII: Dallas Cowboys 27 Denver Broncos 10 - co-MVPs Randy White &amp; Harvey Martin - For the first and only time in Super Bowl history, two players shared the MVP award.

The NFL MVP award is presented annually to the league's top player, as decided by the Associated Press. The AP enlists a nationwide panel of 50 sportswriters and media members who regularly cover  
The Cowboys went into Super Bowl XII as the clear favorites to claim their second title, partially because they still had Super Bowl VI MVP Roger Staubach calling the shots at quarterback. Meanwhile, the Broncos weren’t rebuilding their team — they were building their team after bringing Morton onboard and finally securing winning records

Cooper Kupp was crowned MVP at Super Bowl LVI for the Rams in 2022 with his two touchdowns and 99 all-purpose yards earning him the award over Matthew Stafford. Barkley is without a doubt the most likely non-quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP and the running back is currently priced at +260 with most USA bookmakers to take home the award. 
Super Bowl XII MVP's Randy White and Harvey Martin are all smiles after the Cowboy's victory over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XII in 1977 in New Orleans. 
In a 14-game season he totaled 85 tackles and a league-leading 23 sacks [6] (more than Michael Strahan's 22.5 record in 16 games), he was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, a consensus All-Pro selection, was a key player in the Cowboys winning Super Bowl XII, and a co-MVP of the game with Randy White. 
That gave Denver a first down. Keyworth took a draw to get into field goal range, then kicker Jim Turner – a veteran of Super Bowl III with the New York Jets – made a 47-yard field goal, the longest in Super Bowl history at the time. As of today, it still stands as a tie for the fifth-longest in Super Bowl history.

Two players were named MVP of Super Bowl XII: defensive tackle Randy White and defensive end Harvey Martin. Both led an elite Dallas Cowboys defense in 1978. To this day, that was the only time in NFL history that two players were named co-MVP. 
Super Bowl XII: Dallas Cowboys 27, Denver Broncos 10 Jan. 15, 1978. Ticket prices had escalated to $30 for the first indoor Super Bowl, and Broncos fans probably wanted a refund. In what had to be the worst offensive performance in Super Bowl history, the Broncos turned the ball over eight times and managed only 156 yards of total offense. 
On Sunday, February 9 th, the Super Bowl will once again return to the Big Easy, with the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Philadelphia Eagles in a Super Bowl rematch. This will be the 11 th time that New Orleans will host the biggest game in professional football. Of those 11 games, 8 of them have come in Caeser’s Superdome; the other 3 were  </p>
