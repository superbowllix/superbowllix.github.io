The Super Bowl halftime show is essentially the biggest concert of the year. Sure, it might top out at just 15 minutes or so, but there’s no event with more eyeballs on it than the Super Bowl. 
A Super Bowl halftime show is a strategic opportunity for musicians because its financial advantages extend well beyond streaming and sales. In an interview, marketing expert Sheri Lambert referred to it as a “marketing partnership rather than a performance,” stating that the status and attention are more important than a salary.

The Super Bowl halftime show, an unpaid performance lasting about 12 to 15 minutes, has attracted the biggest music artists including Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Usher, Maroon 5, and Justin Timberlake.
