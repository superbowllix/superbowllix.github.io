Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Former USC quarterback Rob Hertel has an NFL player page, but he is not on the Pro Football Reference page for the 1980 NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles, who played in Super Bowl XV versus the Oakland Raiders in January of 1981. That explains the discrepancy between some final tallies and others. 
In the Super Bowl era, USC quarterbacks have won six national titles and 22 conference titles. Yet no USC quarterback has ever played in a Super Bowl. 
Third String QB in Minnesota behind Brett Favre and Tarvaris Jackson Had Tryouts With The Tennessee Titans and Houston Texans John David Booty comes from an athletic family, but while the other members of his family attended Louisiana State University, John David attended USC and backed up Matt Leinart before becoming the starter in his junior  
How many Super Bowl winning QBs came from USC? The same amount produced by Texas, and Ohio State, and Oklahoma, and LSU, and Penn State combined - zero. Miami was once QB U in the college game, but it hasn't cranked out any Super Bowl winning QBs, either. 
McDonald's competitive nature and command of the huddle inspired his teammates to persevere in even the most challenging of circumstances. With a Rose Bowl MVP award and a national championship under his belt, McDonald's place among the all-time great USC quarterbacks is indisputable. 
Robert Garland Johnson (born March 18, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the USC Trojans and was a fourth-round pick in the 1995 NFL draft by the expansion team Jacksonville Jaguars. With USC, Johnson won the 1995 Cotton Bowl Classic. 
USC head coach Lincoln Riley joins 'Super Bowl Live' to discuss Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts best traits at QB. Chicago Bears wide receivers Rome Odunze and DJ Moore join "Super  
The other five quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era produced mixed results. Todd Marinovich — the No. 24 pick in 1991 — played just two seasons in the NFL with the Los Angeles Raiders. 
Former UNLV quarterback Jayden Maiava, who transferred to USC this year, will lead the Trojans in the Las Vegas Bowl at Allegiant Stadium on Friday. 
From SB Nation: “In the Super Bowl era, USC quarterbacks have won six national titles and 22 conference titles. Yet no USC quarterback has ever played in a Super Bowl.” Looked it up because I was curious. ‘None’ is a big surprise. 
Ferragamo had shared the starting quarterback job with Steve Bartkowski at Cal for two seasons before moving on the Nebraska. In Super Bowl XIV, Ferragamo was 15-for-25 for 212 yards, no  
At USC, he made it to three Rose Bowl appearances and won two national championships. In the final game of his college career, the 1975 Rose Bowl , he was named co- Most Valuable Player . Haden also was a recipient of the Today's Top V Award in 1975, which at the time honored five (now ten) senior student-athletes. 
USC Trojans quarterback Jayden Maiava (14) scrambles out of a sack attempt by Texas A&amp;M Aggies defensive lineman Cashius Howell (18) during the first half of their Las Vegas Bowl game at Allegiant  
Former UNLV quarterback Jayden Maiava is coming back to Las Vegas. He’ll return with USC (6-6) to face Texas A&amp;M (8-4) in the Las Vegas Bowl at 7:30 p.m. Dec. 27 at Allegiant Stadium. 
Leinart picked up only a limited number of snaps in mop-up duty behind Warner. Warner started 16 games and took the Cardinals to their first ever Super Bowl, cementing his status as starter and Leinart's status as a backup. For the 2008 season, he completed 15 of 29 passing attempts (51.7%), one touchdown, one interception, and an 80.2 passer  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Delhomme replaced Peete as starting quarterback for the rest of the season, leading the team to an 11–5 record and the Super Bowl XXXVIII game against the New England Patriots. [19] On February 28, 2005, Peete was released for salary cap reasons, but he chose to retire instead of re-signing with the Panthers for another season with a lower
