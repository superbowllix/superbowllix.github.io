The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of

Previously, the most-watched telecast was last year's Super Bowl matchup between the Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. Initially ranked as the third most-watched game, behind the 2015 and 2017 Super Bowls, Nielsen later revised its measurement, increasing the viewership from 113 million to a record-breaking 115.1 million. 
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
In 2024, Super Bowl LVII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers achieved a TV rating of 42.1, up from the all-time low of 36.9 two years prior. 
Super Bowl viewership increased in every single demographic, but no more than in the young and female demos that attracted so much attention this season. The biggest year-over-year gain in Super Bowl viewership this year was among women 18-24, 3.87 million of whom tuned in across CBS and Univision — up 24% from last year (3.18M).

On NBC, the game had a preliminary 37 U.S. household rating and was viewed in an average of 45 million homes, as the Rams defeated the Bengals 23-20 to claim the franchise’s first title in Los Angeles. This year, 72% of U.S. homes with televisions in use were tuned to the Super Bowl LVI telecast. 
Since that 2021 down year, the Super Bowl has come back with higher viewership, as audiences of 101 million and 113 million, respectively, tuned into the last two title games.
