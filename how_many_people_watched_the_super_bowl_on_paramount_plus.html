        <h2><strong>how many people watched the super bowl on paramount plus super bowl xli quarterbacks</strong></h2>
        <p>The 21.8 million number refers to Out Of Home (OOH) viewers who watched the Super Bowl LVI in bars, restaurants, and other venues, including viewing in other people’s homes. To make it easy to get the numbers right, I have compiled a chart with viewership stats from 2013-2024 of all the numbers reported by the broadcast networks. 
Paramount+ said users streamed 2.64 billion minutes during the Super Bowl matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers. But while a billion anything can’t be ignored, the announcement didn’t offer a clear picture of how the streamer actually did after hosting the big game for the first time. The only comparison it [] 
Paramount's CBS unit already declared the matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers to be the most watched telecast in history, with a total audience of 124.3 million tuning  
That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
The average second-by-second households audience on linear and streaming, across CBS, Univision, Nickelodeon and Paramount Plus was 50.5 million households. CBS drew an average second audience of 121.9 million. CBS accounted for 36% of all TV ad impressions on Sunday, per iSpot. 
Paramount Plus also had a record-setting audience, establishing a record for the most-streamed Super Bowl in history. CBS did not say how many people streamed the game. Earlier, Nielsen rival iSpot.tv reported that 126.6 million people watched the Super Bowl, up 10.9% from last year. 
Sunday's game was the most watched Super Bowl in history. About 123.4 million people tuned in across several platforms, including CBS, Paramount+, Univision and Nickelodeon, which featured  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
Super Bowl LVIII is the most-watched program ever, averaging 123.4 million viewers across all platforms, up +7% versus last year's Super Bowl which was the previous record (115.1 million). More than 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all-or-part of Super Bowl LVIII across all networks, the highest unduplicated total audience in history and up  
112.3 million people watched Super Bowl LVI, but according to NBCU, only 10% of the audience streamed the game. I explain why the number of streamers was much higher than NBCU suggests. Paramount+ ads 7.3 million subscribers (18:20) ViacomCBS has rebranded to Paramount Global and is putting a renewed focus on its streaming businesses. 
We show you the best way to live stream Super Bowl LVI online without cable on Paramount Plus. You can stream Super Bowl on NBC with Paramount Plus live on Apple TV, Roku, Amazon, Fire TV, Chromecast, iOS, and Android. Learn how to get a FREE Trial and watch The Big Game with Paramount Plus today. 
With so many people streaming at once, though, I worried that my local ISP, and/or Paramount Plus, might not be up to the task. Cursory glances online, especially, as the game was about to get  
2. Live Streaming of the Super Bowl: Paramount Plus enables you to watch the Super Bowl live, as it happens. Whether you’re at home, at a Super Bowl party, or on the go, you can tune in to Paramount Plus and experience the excitement of the game in real time. 
TSN will carry the Super Bowl ($20 monthly). TSN Plus ($8 monthly, included with TSN) will show a "data-enhanced" stream of the Super Bowl. DAZN will carry the Super Bowl as part of NFL Game Pass International ($30 monthly). This is probably true in many other countries where NFL GPI is available on DAZN. 
Heading into last year’s Super Bowl, a Harris Poll found that 76% of people who were likely to watch the game were at least somewhat excited about the commercials. While your mileage may vary in terms of how entertaining you find the current era of Super Bowl ads, they are still an important part of the Big Game’s overall appeal. 
Part 1. Does Paramount Plus Include the Super Bowl? To answer the “Can I watch the Super Bowl on Paramount Plus?” query, finding out if the Super Bowl is indeed available on Paramount Plus is vital. Luckily, it’s now on both the app and website of Paramount Plus. Regardless of what subscription plan you’re holding (Essential or  
You’ll be able to watch Super Bowl LVIII with a Paramount Plus subscription, including the highly-anticipated Super Bowl 2024 halftime show headlined by Usher, and all of the commercials. Just  
It was the dedicated streaming selection for the Super bowl. I opened up Paramount Plus (phone app, PC / web browser and TV VR Roku) and top center is the Super Bowl banner taking up almost whatever view you have. In the lower left of the Savannah is the WATCH NOW . Clicked on it and Face The Nation showed up instead of the Super bowl. 
Super Bowl LIX kicks off on FOX, Tubi, Fox Deportes, and Telemundo at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, February 9, 2025. The Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles in the Big Game at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.
