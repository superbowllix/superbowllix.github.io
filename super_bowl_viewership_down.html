The number of Americans who watched the Super Bowl on TV last year fell 13% from the peak in 2015, but the average cost of a 30-second advertising spot has just kept climbing.This year, the retail  
In 2022, with the resumption of full venue attendances at NFL games, Super Bowl LVI on NBC saw an average of 99.18 million viewers and total of 101.09 million, with streaming contributing an extra 11 million for a total of 112.3 million people.
