        <p>Ranking the 57 Super Bowls From Worst to Best.  Every once in a while, a game is an instant classic. Super Bowl XLII was such an event. The Patriots entered as inevitable champions, having  
This was only the second time in Super Bowl history both quarterbacks passed for at least 300 yards, and it ranked second in Super Bowl history in terms of total offensive yards produced. The 37 points in the fourth quarter were the most combined points in any quarter of a Super Bowl game, much less the decisive fourth quarter. 
Fun fact, Super Bowl IV was the final championship game played between an NFL team (Minnesota) and a team from the AFL (Kansas City). Both teams entered the contest on a high. Minnesota handled Cleveland 27-7 to reach the Super Bowl, while Kansas City upended the vaunted Raiders 17-7 in the AFL Championship. 
As Super Bowl 59 approaches, here are my all-time Super Sunday game rankings (cardinal number, season noted in parentheses): 1. LI (51, 2016) New England Patriots 34, Atlanta Falcons 28 (OT  
Counting down the history of the big game from worst to best. We took a look at every Super Bowl ever, and ranked them from worst to best. 
After their 15-year Super Bowl drought, the Cowboys absolutely manhandled the Bills in 1993, forcing a Super Bowl-record nine turnovers, and knocking hard-luck Buffalo QB Jim Kelly out of the game  
2. Super Bowl XLIII: Steelers 27, Cardinals 23 It was a game many thought would be the perfect bookend to Kurt Warner's Hall of Fame career, but it turned on two iconic plays by Pittsburgh players. 
38. Super Bowl XXII (1988): Washington 42, Broncos 10. Denver actually led this one 10-0. Then Doug Williams went to work, becoming the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. This game was over at halftime after Washington scoring 35 consecutive points in the second quarter. 37. Super Bowl XXIV (1990): 49ers 55, Broncos 10 
The skinny: Super Bowl LIV was a game with distinct momentum shifts. Kansas City held sway early, building a 10-3 lead in the second quarter. Then San Francisco seized control with three consecutive scores to take a 20-10 lead. As it turned out, the Chiefs had more gas in the tank. 
Super Bowl XXXIII: Denver Broncos 34, Atlanta Falcons 19 Jan. 31, 1999 – Pro Player Stadium (Miami Gardens, Fla.) The final score does not indicate how lopsided this game was. 
A solid if not incredible game, Super Bowl XVI kicked off the 49ers' dynasty.  there will be many people who disagree with this ranking. The Patriots crawling back from a 28-3 deficit, first  
With Super Bowl LIII in the books, we take a look at where the latest title bout and Patriots win ranks throughout NFL history.  Ranking all 53 Super Bowl games from best to worst. 
10. Jordan Mailata, OT. Clearly, high-level football is played in the trenches, as Jordan Mailata is the fifth offensive lineman in our top 10 of the best players in Super Bowl 59.

I ranked my 10 Super Bowls played in New Orleans, a loose and lighthearted ranking based on overall game excitement and memorable moments. It starts with the No. 10 pick and ends with the top choice. 
We’ve reviewed and ranked every Super Bowl played to date -- that's 56 games, from the Green Bay Packers’ historic first win in 1967, to Cooper Kupp and the Los Angeles Rams' nail-biter of a  
Many call this the greatest Super Bowl in history, but it is ranked a little lower here simply because Tom Brady had already proved time and again that counting him out of any game, no matter the  
The Super Bowl, which determines the pro football championship in one of the most dominant sports in the world, is a game that NFL fans look forward to every year. Although each NFL game consists  
The 49ers entered Super Bowl XLVII undefeated in their Super Bowl efforts. Despite Frank Gore and Colin Kaepernick rushing for a combined 172 yards on the ground, the Baltimore Ravens left the Mercedes-Benz Superdome as world champions. Joe Flacco left the game as Super Bowl MVP after he threw for 387 yards and 3 touchdowns. 
The Super Bowl is obviously the biggest game of the NFL season, so it makes sense that a number of the championship games throughout the league’s history have been iconic. Teams and players are  </p>
