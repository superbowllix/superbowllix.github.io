        <h2><strong>most recent eagles super bowl win church super bowl ad cost</strong></h2>
        <p>Philadelphia's Super Bowl 52 victory over the Patriots is its only (and therefore, most recent) Super Bowl win. The Eagles also appeared in the Super Bowl two years ago but lost to the Chiefs in  
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33 The Eagles were decisive underdogs going into Super Bowl 52, but they were  
The Eagles have won just one Super Bowl during their franchise's history. That came in Super Bowl 52, which was played in 2018 as part of the 2017 NFL playoffs. 
Super Bowl 52 (2017 season): 41-33 win over New England Patriots Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 loss to Kansas City Chiefs Philadelphia Eagles running back has dominated the run game every  
Despite a late surge by the Patriots, the Eagles’ defense, led by Brandon Graham, made a crucial strip-sack of Brady in the final minutes. Philadelphia emerged victorious with a 41-33 win, and Nick Foles was named Super Bowl MVP. The triumph marked the franchise’s first Super Bowl win and solidified their place in NFL history. 
The Eagles have just one Super Bowl win, where they bested the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII (2018). Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl history: Super Bowl 1981: 27-10 loss to the  
The Eagles would lose their next Super Bowl appearance to the Patriots nearly 24 years later before getting their revenge against New England in Super Bowl 52. That 41-33 win over the Patriots  
While the Eagles are a storied NFL franchise, they had never won a Super Bowl entering the 2017 campaign. Philadelphia finished with a 13-3 record and secured the top seed in the NFC, but they had to navigate the postseason without second-year quarterback and MVP candidate Carson Wentz, who had torn his ACL in Week 14. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
How many Super Bowls have the Philadelphia Eagles won? As of January 2025, the Philadelphia Eagles have won only one Super Bowl in a total of four appearances. Philly will appear in their fifth  
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. 
The Chiefs, of course, went on to defeat the Eagles on a field goal with eight seconds left in the Super Bowl. Why the Eagles will win.  Most recent NFL stories. 
Eagles are the better team in this Super Bowl. From top to bottom, the Eagles have the better roster in Super Bowl LIX. The Chiefs are in this spot due to having an unstoppable force at quarterback in Patrick Mahomes, but it’s hard not to be overwhelmed by the totality of the Eagles’ roster in comparison. 
Two years ago, when the Eagles and Chiefs played each other in the Super Bowl, a slightly larger share of Americans backed the Chiefs (30%) than the Eagles (27%).. Compared to two years ago, relative support for the Chiefs against the Eagles has especially fallen among Americans who definitely plan to watch the Super Bowl: In 2023, that group favored the Chiefs by 8 percentage points, but in  
Super Bowl: 4 (1-3) Pre-Super Bowl Championships: 4 (3-1) In all, the Philadelphia Eagles have played 54 postseason games in their 90+ year history. They are currently 28-26 in those contests. Their conference championship record sits at 5-4, and they are 1-3 in Super Bowls. They did win three championships in the pre-Super Bowl era (1948, 1949  
Eagles Super Bowl record. The Eagles have just a 1-3 record in the Super Bowl. Their lone win came during the 2017 NFL playoffs (played in 2018) and saw Nick Foles lead the team to a 41-33 win  
Philadelphia earned the most recent win in the series, while Kansas City's four-game winning streak from 2013 through Super Bowl 57 is the longest in the series. 2023: Eagles 21, Chiefs 17 Super  
Super Bowl LII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2017 season.As a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX from 13 years earlier, the game was between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles and the American Football Conference (AFC) and defending Super Bowl LI champion New England Patriots. 
Kansas City also earned a last-second win in their most recent Super Bowl win over the Eagles. Harrison Butker made a field goal with 8 seconds remaining to give the Chiefs a 38-35 victory. 
This game is a rematch of Super Bowl LVII from two years earlier. It will be the eighth Super Bowl played in the Superdome and the 11th overall in New Orleans, the most recent being Super Bowl XLVII in 2013.
