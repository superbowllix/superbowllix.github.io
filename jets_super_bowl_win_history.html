As heavy underdogs at Super Bowl III, the Jets represented the AFL with distinction as they defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts. The Jets became the first AFL team to defeat an NFL team in their combined championship game. When was the last New York Jets Super Bowl win? As noted, the Jets have been in just one Super Bowl, which they won in 1969.

The New York Jets defeating the then-Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III remains the biggest upset in Super Bowl history. The Colts were 18-point favorites before getting stunned by Broadway Joe  
The Jets have not played in the Super Bowl since the merger, losing the AFC Championship Game in the 1982, 1998, 2009 and 2010 seasons. [72] On the other hand, the Colts won Super Bowl V (1970), then after relocating to Indianapolis, won Super Bowl XLI (2006) and lost Super Bowl XLIV (2009). [73] [74] 
January 12th, 1969: Football’s New York Jets beat the Baltimore Colts to win Super Bowl III, fulfilling an unlikely prediction made by Jets quarterback Joe Namath. 
Tyler Forness: (Editor's note: Forness picked the Chiefs to win in our predictions post) The Super Bowl MVP has gone to a player on the winning team in every instance but one: Super Bowl V when Dallas Cowboys LB Chuck Howley won the award in a 16-13 loss to the Baltimore Colts. This could be the second instance, as Saquon Barkley is the engine

The win was the first in the Super Bowl for the AFL, which merged with the NFL for the 1970 season. Before Super Bowl III, an NFL coach said, "Namath plays his first pro football game today." But  
The New York Jets last played a home playoff game on Jan 4, 2003, nearly 23 years ago, when they hosted the Colts in the Wild Card Round of the 2002 NFL playoffs, in which the Jets scored a 41-0 win. When was the last time the Jets lost a playoff game? 
The Jets' best chance to reach the Super Bowl after the Super Bowl III victory was thwarted by A.J. Duhe in 1983 whose interception return for touchdown on a rain-soaked field in the conference championship game was the decisive score. [117] This remains as the lone postseason meeting in the series. [118] 
On this day in 1969, Joe Namath made good on his bold prediction to win the Super Bowl. One moment in New York Jets history easily stands above the rest. Fifty-five years ago today, the Jets won Super Bowl III against the Baltimore Colts. Only a few days before the game, quarterback Joe Namath guaranteed the victory. It was a bold prediction  
Each winning team's Super Bowl rings, as of the 2010 season, on display in lead up to Super Bowl XLV. The Super Bowl is the annual league championship game of the National Football League (NFL) of the United States. 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. </p>
