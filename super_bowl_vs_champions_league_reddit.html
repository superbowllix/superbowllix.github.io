        <h2><strong>super bowl vs champions league reddit super bowl song list usher</strong></h2>
        <p>The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
The 2021 Champions League final brought in 700 million viewers compared to the 2022 Super Bowl's 112 million.  Champions League, but 49% of Reddit users are  
Champions League is nothing like this, there is no commercials or halftime show hoopla, very few women watch and Champions League Final parties with children and wifes making themed snacks aren't common. Its very much an event for soccer fans, and soccer is the only focus. So it really depends on how many fans the two competing teams have. 
The Champions League final vs. Super Bowl argument rages on between football and soccer (also known as ‚Äúfootball‚Äù) fans. It‚Äôs the biggest game of the season in either sport, as the Super Bowl is the marquee matchup in the United States, while the Champions League final rules the parts of the world, where soccer reigns supreme. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl ‚Äî and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
The Champions league has a combined Facebook and Twitter following of 93 million (as of January 18 2020), whereas the Super Bowl has a combined total of 686,000 between the two social media  
Both the Super Bowl and the Champions League final occur annually and both pit professional organizations against each other, rather than national teams. But yet again, the comparison ends with  
The Champions League has also now incorporated a Super Bowl-esque showbiz element with on-field musical performances before kick-off. So, while the Super Bowl is, and likely will always be, the king of US sports, the wider sporting world pays much more attention to the Champions League final. 
Users on r/ShitAmericansSay compare the viewership and tweeting of the Super Bowl and the Champions League final. They comment on the differences in game length, breaks, ads, halftime show, and sports culture. 
Super Bowl vs Champions League final. Which event is bigger? TV audiences, performances, social media, stadiums. 
Champions' League final 109m watched whole thing live at home (206m watched part) Super Bowl 106m (162m) Bahrain GP 54m (115m) Men's 100m final 33m (95m) Federer-Roddick 29m (89m) Japan-South Korea (baseball) 27m (82m) World Series game 6 26m (72m) NBA finals game 5 26m (59m) Masters final day 21m (49m) 
TIL The most popular annual sporting event in the world is not the Super Bowl. Instead, it is the final match of a soccer event called the "UEFA Champions League" 
Yeah, it's definitely expected that the comparison would be made. But that doesn't make the comparison any less dumb. Even 5 or 10 seconds of critical thinking would tell even the least logical NFL fan that the sport of soccer has a much larger following worldwide than a sport that is almost exclusively enjoyed by Americans. 
NFL Super Bowl vs UEFA Champions League: Ultimate Comparison | üèà VS ‚öΩÔ∏è 
"The Super Bowl is watched by an average of just under 100 million viewers in the US, with another 30-50 million tuning in from other countries." "The Champions League final usually attracts between 380 and 400 million viewers who tune in outside the stadium where the game is played." 
The last 25 Super Bowl champions and their offensive and defensive rankings One discussion that always seems to come up here is whether offense or defense is more important to win championships, as always there are examples of teams winning carried by one side of the ball, and some teams winning by being great all around, this thread is to show

But to your comment, yea, Champions League final may be Europe's "Super Bowl," but the game still isn't on the production level of say the NBA finals or Super Bowl, but a lot of soccer fans like it that wayit's more simple and to the point. Not near as much fluff and off-field segments as American sports. 
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event of the year by a wide margin. People who haven‚Äôt watched a single NFL game all year will plan Super Bowl parties. That‚Äôs not to say that people consciously think ‚Äòwinning the Super Bowl is more impressive than winning the NBA Finals‚Äô. But way more people care about the former than the latter. 
Nope because college football is a completely different animal with over a hundred teams. Also all the major bowls, conferences and what not. For the pac12 and big10 when The Rose Bowl was the goal for the majority of college football the national champions were determined by the media and there have even been Co champions. </p>
