        <p>EXTREME guitarist Nuno Bettencourt shared the stage with Rihanna when the Grammy Award-winning R&amp;B artist took the stage in Phoenix Sunday (February 12) for her 2023 Super Bowl halftime performance. 
Despite their collaborative history, the Super Bowl show marked the first time Bettencourt and Rihanna had played together in almost a decade – and Bettencourt further celebrated their rekindled musical partnership by wielding a curiously eye-catching version of his Washburn N4 signature guitar. 
Even before that, though, Bettencourt made an appearance on the biggest stage of them all, that of the Super Bowl halftime show. Wielding a special version of his Washburn N4 signature guitar , Bettencourt brought some hard-rock fire to Rihanna's acclaimed performance as a member – for the first time in almost a decade – of the pop

Last night, February 12, marked the 2023 edition of the Super Bowl, and pop star Rihanna was the artist chosen to perform during this year's halftime show. 
Rock fans watching this year’s Super Bowl likely experienced a jolt of unexpected delight when they caught a glimpse of one of their own – Nuno Bettencourt, ever-present Washburn N4 in hand – performing alongside Rihanna during her halftime-show extravaganza. But while his screen time was exceedingly brief – “about 1.5 milliseconds  
Nuno Bettencourt said that playing with Rihanna on this year's Super Bowl was a "bucket-list moment", but noted that the pop star's backing band got a "pathetic" amount of screen time. 
Bettencourt goes on to recall his experience of playing with Rihanna at this year’s Super Bowl halftime show. “Look, it was a trip for many reasons,” he says. “One was [that] the halftime show is iconic, and to be a part of it and rehearse at the stadium and be a part of that history. 
Super Bowl LVII, which took place in February at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, stood out with its halftime show, a performance featuring Rihanna and her seasoned electric guitar partner Nuno Bettencourt. In a recent conversation with Katie Daryl of AXS TV, Bettencourt reminisced about his experience of joining Rihanna and expressed his disappointment. []

Bettencourt's most publicly visible gig, however, came with pop superstar Rihanna, with whom he embarked on a number of tours in the early 2010s, before re-joining the singer once again earlier this year at the Super Bowl LVII halftime show. 
And all these years later, Nuno is still with Rihanna and has also gotten the chance to play the Super Bowl as her backing musician. Looking back at the past decade or so, he said: “But those things lead Everything leads to something. And in some moments, like, obviously, the Rihanna stuff has been amazing.

Super Bowl LVII (that's 57, for those of you not up to scratch on your Roman numerals) saw the Kansas City Chiefs overcome a 10-point halftime deficit to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles in a hugely entertaining game - but it was pop superstar Rihanna's epic halftime show that grabbed headlines in the music world. </p>
