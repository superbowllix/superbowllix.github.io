        <p>The Kansas City Chiefs are in the midst of a dynastic run with Patrick Mahomes at quarterback, and they have a chance to earn a never-before-achieved Super Bowl three-peat in 2025. But it wasn't  
In 2023, Kansas City defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 38-35, in Super Bowl 57 to claim the franchise's fourth NFL championship. Prior to that, the Chiefs played played in Super Bowl 54 
Len Dawson led the Chiefs to a decisive 16-point victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl 4 a few years later. After that, however, Kansas City went 50 years without winning a title 
We took a look at Kansas City's opponent with our dive into the Eagles Super Bowl history. Where do the Chiefs rank in Super Bowl wins? The Chiefs have won four Super Bowls, which is tied 
Here's a look at each result in Kansas City's Super Bowl history: Super Bowl 1967: 35-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers; Super Bowl 1970: 23-7 win vs. the Minnesota Vikings; Super Bowl 2020: 31-20  
The Kansas City Chiefs can make quite a bit of history if they defeat the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX. With a win, the Chiefs would join the Steelers, Patriots, 49ers and Cowboys as the  
Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl History. Super Bowl 1967: 35-10 loss to Green Bay Packers; Super Bowl 1970: 23-7 win vs. Minnesota Vikings; Super Bowl 2020: 31-20 win vs. San Francisco 49ers; Super  
This year will mark the Chiefs sixth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Kansas City played in the first-ever Super Bowl, losing Super Bowl I against Bart Starr and the Green Bay Packers in January 1967. When was the last Super Bowl the Chiefs played in? 
Kansas City didn’t have to wait much longer for its next trip to the Super Bowl, as the Chiefs won the big game against the 49ers in February 2024. Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 25-22 overtime victory over the Niners in a low-scoring, defensive battle.

How many times have the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl? The Kansas City Chiefs have won a total of 4 Super Bowls, in 1969, 2019 and 2022-2023. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in Kansas City. 
Kansas City secured its third Super Bowl victory in five seasons on Sunday, marking just the fifth time in the Super Bowl Era that a team has won three titles in five years. Kansas City joined the 1974-78 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 1992-95 Dallas Cowboys, the 2001-04 New England Patriots and the 2014-18 Patriots as the only teams to achieve that  
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will meet at Super Bowl 59, with two of the best NFL teams in recent seasons colliding in New Orleans with the Vince Lombardi Trophy on the line  
THE CHIEFS' SPECIAL SUPER BOWL PLAY. The Chiefs have already revealed one new play they will try to run during the Super Bowl. This play, called 65 Toss Power Trap, is an homage to the first Super Bowl-winning team in Chiefs history. Back in 1970, the Chiefs won Super Bowl IV against the Minnesota Vikings.

Kansas City has now matched the best start in franchise history, joining the 2003 and 2013 squads with a 9-0 run to begin the year.

Kansas City draws record audiences. Some 57.4 million viewers tuned in to Chiefs-Bills, the most ever for an AFC championship game. The second Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl—KC beat  
Since 2006, the team with the better defense has won 11 times, while the team with the better offense has won just seven times. Notably, the five highest-ranked Super Bowl offenses since 2006 all lost the Super Bowl. Trouble for the Eagles? The 2024 Eagles rank among the strongest Super Bowl teams relative to their competition in the same season.
