On top of the 33 quarterbacks to win Super Bowl MVP, eight wide receivers and seven running backs have won the award. Defensively, only 10 players have won the award and one special teams ace has  
The NFL selects a panel of 16 writers and broadcasters who are covering the game to vote on Super Bowl MVP. Since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, the league has allowed fans to also vote for the game’s MVP, but the fan vote only counts for 20%, while the media panel represents 80%. Each media member votes for their top five players for Super Bowl MVP. 
A total of seven QBs have won both NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP. Patrick Mahomes was the last to accomplish the feat, having done so in 2023. Here is the full list of players who won both an NFL MVP  
The NFL MVP award is presented annually to the league's top player, as decided by the Associated Press. The AP enlists a nationwide panel of 50 sportswriters and media members who regularly cover  
Former Seattle Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck admits his focus was on getting top WR Darrell Jackson the MVP award of Super Bowl XL.  Ultimately, a wide receiver was named Super Bowl MVP  
Tyler Forness: (Editor's note: Forness picked the Chiefs to win in our predictions post) The Super Bowl MVP has gone to a player on the winning team in every instance but one: Super Bowl V when Dallas Cowboys LB Chuck Howley won the award in a 16-13 loss to the Baltimore Colts.

7. Joe Montana, QB, San Francisco 49ers (Super Bowl XIX) In a duel against a fellow Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino, it was Joe Montana who showed out on the biggest stage. 
Super Bowl LIII marked the only other time Tom Brady wasn’t named the MVP of a Super Bowl he won, as that honor went to Julian Edelman.

Wilson has nine Pro Bowl trips, the Walter Payton Man of the Year award and a Super Bowl ring. The MVP award has eluded him, even though his career body of work is better than some who have won the trophy — particularly Cam Newton (2015) and Matt Ryan (2016).
