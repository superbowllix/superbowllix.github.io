Philadelphia has been fueled not just by arguably the best roster in football but by bitter endings to the last two seasons. After a heartbreaking 38-35 loss to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII, the Eagles stumbled down the stretch and lost six of seven last year, leading to the ouster of both coordinators and questions about coach Nick Sirianni's job status. 
The Super Bowl isn't just the most-viewed sporting spectacle, it's also the most bet-on event in America.Nearly 68 million adults placed wagers on the big game last year. Given this year's rematch  
The Kansas City Chiefs are chasing history. Only the Philadelphia Eagles are standing in their way.. The Chiefs are the NFL ninth team to win back-to-back Super Bowls and are trying to become the first to win three straight championships in the Super Bowl era when they meet the Eagles on Feb. 9 in New Orleans for Super Bowl LIX (6:30 p.m. ET, Fox). 
Also working in the Eagles' favor is their defense. Philly is the 13th team (and the first since the 2015 Broncos) to reach the Super Bowl after having the No. 1 defense during the regular season in terms of yards allowed. The previous 12 teams to reach the Super Bowl with the league's No. 1 defense in YPG have gone 10-2 in the big game. 
Plus, the Chiefs must win the edges to limit the Eagles' run game. Philly will use pin/pull concepts to get Barkley on the perimeter, often from condensed sets.
