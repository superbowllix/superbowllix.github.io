        <h2><strong>super bowl qb cap hits how much is super bowl on tv</strong></h2>
        <p>So in 20 years no Super Bowl winning team has invested a higher percentage of their cap on a QB than the first team to ever win one in the cap era. Yet teams continue to pour more and more money into that position each season. Since Young’s championship in 1994, only three other quarterbacks have eaten up 10% of their teams salary cap- Eli  
The Highest Cap Percentages to Reach a Super Bowl. Going back to the year 2000, the QB who reached the Super Bowl with the highest percentage of league salary cap is Peyton Manning, whose $23.2M cap hit in 2009 represented 18.8% of the league cap. The Saints beat the Colts that year. Top 10 Super Bowl QB Cap Percentages. 2009: Peyton Manning  
The vast majority of Super Bowl-winning starters since 1994, however, own cap hits that take up between 10.6% and 12.3% of their respective team's entire salary cap, per Thompson. (Market-leading  
The highest cap hit for a Super Bowl-winning quarterback since the turn of the century came in 2020 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers prevailed with Tom Brady playing under a cap number of $25 million, which amounted to 12.61 percent of their cap. 
The following breakdown shows each starting quarterback's salary cap figure for their Super Bowl season, and the percent of the NFL league salary cap it represented in that year. Notable Notes Patrick Mahomes 16.52% league cap allocation is the 3rd largest since 2000, behind only Peyton Manning (18.88%, 2009), &amp; Mahomes himself last season (17.19%) 
On the flip side, no QB with a cap percentage over 13.1% had ever won a Super Bowl – until this past season. Mahomes’ cap hit was a massive 17.16% of the team total, way more than the 13.1% of Steve Young in the very first year of the cap (under a contract that was signed before a cap existed). 
But he also set a new record for the largest salary-cap percentage used for a Super Bowl-winning quarterback. According to the salary-cap site Spotrac , Mahomes' 2022 cap hit was 17.2%. 
The Super Bowl winning QB never had a salary that was more than 12.2% of his team’s cap (Brady was at that percentage twice). For 2022, that would translate to roughly a $26M cap hit. 
Super Bowl 57: Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes, Eagles’ Jalen Hurts, NFL salary cap, quarterback contracts. Pete Carroll, John Schneider, Geno Smith, Seahawks watching. 
Highest cap hit for Super Bowl winning QB: Troy Aikman (13%) Lowest cap hit for Super Bowl winning QB: Russell Wilson (&lt;1%) 8% of 2022 NFL Salary Cap: $14.6M. If Mahomes manages to win a Super Bowl after this season, his salary will make him a statistical outlier. In the salary cap era, only four QBs with greater than a 12% cap hit have won a  
When it comes to the quarterback position, some of the best players are the ones with the highest cap hits (all according to Spotrac). What is Deshaun Watson’s Cap Hit For 2024? Deshaun Watson’s cap hit for 2024 with the Browns is $63.8 million. What is Aaron Rodgers’ Cap Hit For 2024? Aaron Rodgers’ 2024 cap hit with the Jets is $17.2  
We are talking crazy amounts of money and $45m + cap hits. One stat that stands above the rest is the percentage of cap space used by QBs and Super Bowl wins. The highest paid Super Bowl winning QB was Tom Brady in 2020. His cap hit was $28 million, or just over 14% of the cap. 
Let’s examine the last 10 Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. (Due to the Eagles’ unique situation in 2017, the cap hits of Nick Foles and Carson Wentz were combined for this exercise.) Super  
By comparison, here are the dollar and percentage cap hits of the last 12 Super Bowl winners,  Here are the top 10 QB cap hits and percentages for the 2022 season from Over The Cap: 
A post-June 1 release could ease their cap hit, spreading it out as $40 million in 2025 and $25 million in 2026. However, Atlanta appears to stand firm in keeping Cousins as a backup—a decision that could have ripple effects for teams like Cleveland in search of a seasoned quarterback. 
Steve Young's record 13.1% salary cap hit by a Super Bowl winning QB has been surpassed by Patrick Mahomes' 17.16%. This would be ~$38.6m under 2023's cap. The narrative of not being able to pay a QB more than 13.1% of the cap has stood strong since 1994, but now it is dead and will undoubtedly reshape QB negotiating positions moving forward. 
My last piece looking at the QB cap hits among championship contenders for the past decade drew considerable interest, and spurred some excellent back and forth in the comments section. One of the  
On the other end of the spectrum, quarterbacks with large cap hits almost never make it to the Super Bowl. As a matter of fact, over the past decade (2010-19), the quarterback with the largest cap  
With the Kansas City Chiefs winning the 2022 Super Bowl. Taking up 17.19% of the salary cap, Patrick Mahomes has the highest percentage of cap hit for a QB winning the Super Bowl since 2001. The average cap hit percentage for a Super Bowl winning QB since 01: 7.86% 
The team came in at a whopping 11.1% dead cap space, bringing the total up to 15.61%. That means the better way to look at it is that the Eagles had 84.39% of cap space available for all non-QB positions. So, how much cap space was available for non-QB positions on other recent Super Bowl winning teams? 2020 Buccaneers - 81.03% </p>
