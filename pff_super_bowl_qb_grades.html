        <p>Seattle hung 43 points on Denver in Super Bowl 48, and Wilson was a big reason for it, being one of four quarterbacks to ever produce an elite passing grade in the Super Bowl. Wilson was especially effective in a clean pocket, improving his grade to 92.4 while completing 17 of 22 attempts for 199 yards with three big-time throws. 
Super Bowl 59 is set, and it's time to break down the matchup from every angle. From team metrics and quarterback comparisons to highest-graded players, we dive into the numbers that will define this year’s championship game. Here's everything you need to know about Super Bowl 59, backed by PFF's data-driven insights. 
Jake Brendel has a 72.8 PFF run-blocking grade, top-15 at the center position. QB Sam Darnold, San Francisco 49ers: 66.0; Sam Darnold completed 61.5% of his pass attempts for 189 yards and a touchdown in his one start this season, earning a 73.0 PFF grade. LB Oren Burks, San Francisco 49ers: 66.0; Oren Burks earned a 71.8 PFF grade in coverage  
He also has the second-best PFF passing grade when kept clean (92.6)," PFF said. Mahomes has turned into the best quarterback in the league during the playoffs. The Chiefs go as Mahomes goes. 
PFF gave Nick Foles the highest Super Bowl grade by any quarterback since 2006.  Donovan McNabb is the only other QB to pay in the Super Bowl for the Eagles this century, but the PFF list doesn

Super Bowl 59 By The Numbers: Team metrics, QB comparisons, highest-graded players and more Today, 07:01 AM Everything you need to know about Super Bowl 59, backed by PFF's data-driven insights. 
The San Francisco 49ers lost 25-22 to the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl 58. Today, Pro Football Focus released its grades from the game, revealing which Niners stood out and who failed to  
14. QB Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs: 75.2. The Super Bowl MVP had a fantastic outing, leading his team to back-to-back championships. While Mahomes did register his first turnover-worthy play of the playoffs, he was incredible as both a passer and a runner. 
QB Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles PFF Grade: 92.2. Hurts recorded five big-time throws, which tied for the second-most in a Super Bowl over the past 22 years. He went 27-of-38 for 304 yards and produced a 92.9 PFF passing grade. 
With Matt Ryan and Tom Brady coming into this year's big game ranked Nos. 1 and 2 in the league in PFF's QB grades, quarterback play should once again be a determining factor. Here are the five highest QB grades in Super Bowls in the PFF era — spanning from 2006 to 2015: 1. Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers, Super Bowl XLV, 94.3 
Over the last five seasons – starting with 2019 when they met in the Super Bowl – Kittle boasts the highest PFF grade among tight ends at 93.6; however, the gap between the two players is as small as it can be: Kelce ranks second with a 93.5 overall PFF grade since 2019. 
The quarterbacks are ranked by their current PFF grade through the first three weeks of the playoffs, and of course, the PFF grading system isolates the play of each quarterback on every play during the season. Here’s a look at the top quarterbacks in the NFL in 2019 as ordered by PFF grade. 
Hurts finished the game with five big-time throws, tied for the second-most in a Super Bowl since the 2001 season (we have full-season grades for 2006 onward, but we have graded every Super Bowl since 2001). His 92.9 passing grade was the best mark ever earned by a quarterback in that span. Highest PFF passing grades in the Super Bowl (2001-2022)

He was PFF’s highest-graded center during the regular season (92.8), leading the position in PFF run-blocking grade (91.1) and PFF pass-blocking grade (90.6). Humphrey was the only center to record 90.0 grades in both phases. He allowed seven pressures all season (fewest) and recorded a 92.6 PFF grade in zone blocking schemes (first). 
The list is heavily influenced by PFF grades, but it isn't solely based on that one data point. The following list, which is in no particular order, is merely a trip down memory lane to the biggest moments and performances of recent Super Bowl history.
