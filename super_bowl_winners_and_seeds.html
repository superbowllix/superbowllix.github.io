Funnily enough, the #4 seed has managed to win the Super Bowl seven times since 1975, with AFC teams accounting for four of these wins. #3, #5 and #6 seeds have all won the Super Bowl twice  
They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, giving them four Super Bowl appearances in five years and putting them one win away from three consecutive Super Bowl titles.

Well, last year, neither #1 seed made it to the Super Bowl-- it was the Bengals, seeded #4, who beat the #1 and #2 AFC seeds. The Rams were also the #4 seed in the NFC who defeated the #2 seed to play the SB in their home stadium. Your chances of winning improve drastically once you get to the big game. 
About three-quarters (32 of 42) of teams that made the Super Bowl got a bye (first or second seed) from 1999 to 2019 made the Super Bowl. This included 52% of teams that were the one seed and 24%
