        <h2><strong>justin timberlake janet super bowl reddit airbnb super bowl new orleans</strong></h2>
        <p>I heard this was basically a Leave Justin Alone piece and is it ever. “On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
I think she's forgiving him for the way the fallout was handled. Janet was lambasted and shamed, while Justin walked away without scrutiny. He abandoned her to accept the blame. He's since apologized for his cowardice and how it affected Janet's career and emotional health. So yeah, I think she has stuff to forgive him for 
Another thing people forget is that Janet Jackson had been famous for at least eighteen years at at the time of the Super Bowl. She released Control in 1986 and the Super Bowl occurred in 2004. I remember her career being a little on the decline at this point. I never stopped letting Janet be a megastar. 
Janet Jackson revealed that she spoke to Justin Timberlake just once after the infamous “wardrobe malfunction” incident at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, advising him to remain silent. In  
After the news broke that Justin Timberlake would headline this year's Super Bowl halftime show, this hashtag started to emerge: #JusticeForJanet. That's, of course, because during Timberlake's  
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple  
After the release of Malfunction: The Dressing Down of Janet Jackson, a new documentary about the aftermath of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake‘s infamous 2004 Super Bowl Halftime Show  
On February 1, 2004, Janet Jackson, then 38-years-old, and Justin Timberlake, then 23-years-old, caused a wake of mass cultural hysteria when, at the end of Jackson’s Super Bowl Halftime  
It was Timberlake, after all, who along with Janet Jackson at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show gave birth to the phrase “wardrobe malfunction’’ and together were embroiled in “Nipplegate 
Janet Jackson Says She Was Disinvited to Grammys, Told Justin Timberlake to Not Respond Amid Super Bowl Backlash. Through her Lifetime doc's archival footage of the event and new interviews with  
Yes. Less talented. Justin writes, produces, acts, and sings (may I mention he's incredible at all of those things). Janet just sings. Not even too good at that anymore. Just because someone was big in the 80s or 90s doesn't mean they are better than anyone who came after them. Justin is more talented and will be remembered far more dearly. 
First, I love Janet Jackson, and I really enjoy Justin Timberlake. Both are people I’d love to meet, and both seem like genuinely nice people. On to my argument: Like many of you, I saw it live on tv. To this day, I cannot be convinced it was an accident. 
An older lady had invited us over to have a super bowl party and watch the game on her big screen. When that happened the youth pastor just covered his face with his hands and ran out of the room lol 
This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). I remember people being quite negative about him being picked in 2017 because it was assumed he and Janet were banned after the controversial 2004 performance - CBS officials would deny placing a ban on her. 
Justin, Janet, and several MTV execs and choreographers all decided they were going to do that, and they made up a ridiculous story when the reaction they got wasn't what they expected. But that said, yes, Janet pretty much lost her whole career while Justin went on to higher and higher levels of success, and that isn't fair at all.

The Super Bowl was always weirdly conventional, but the commercials were all weirdly edgy. Two years earlier, there was that Coor’s Light Superbowl commercial that was a parody of Tom T Hall’s “I Love (Little Baby Ducks)” but the punchline is having threesome with twins (because lesbianism and incest are comparable, and both acceptable  
TIL that the term “wardrobe malfunction” was coined in 2004. Justin Timberlake first used it in an apology to Janet Jackson for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, where Jackson’s breast was exposed. Media began using the term, and eventually it was added to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary. 
This was the first half time show I missed. I was in the garage smoking a bowl. When I came back in, everyone was freaking out because of Janet Jackson's boob. I felt that I missed something culturally significant. I haven't missed a Super Bowl halftime show since.
