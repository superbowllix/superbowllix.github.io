        <h2><strong>super bowl commercials 2025 jesus washing feet who played in super bowl xii</strong></h2>
        <p>One year after ads by the He Gets Us campaign ignited a social media debate, a new round of Jesus-centric Super Bowl commercials on Sunday night found believers divided once again. 
In eight of the ad’s 12 images, the person doing the foot-washing is a put-together, cisgender-presenting white person, some middle- and some working-class, washing the feet of their presumed  
A Christian commercial about Jesus that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday angered some conservatives who felt like the advertisement justified certain sins. 
The Super Bowl ad about Christianity, showing scenes of people washing others' feet like Jesus did in the Bible, is facing attacks from the left over the campaign's link to the billionaire family  
While the He Gets Us campaign is best-known for its Super Bowl ads — last year’s spot, featuring people washing each other’s feet, went viral — the sprawling PR effort is everywhere: the  
The ad was based on a Bible story about Jesus washing the disciples’ feet, a lesson of humility in service to others. Lerma did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. 
This image provided by He Gets Us LLC shows a scene from “Foot Washing,” the 60-second commercial from “He Gets Us” that debuted at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. For the second year in a row, a religious Super Bowl ad campaign promised viewers that Jesus “gets us.” 
Obviously a reference to the biblical story of Jesus washing his disciples' feet on the night before he was crucified. And fans were a little caught out by the subject matter: According to Adage , He Gets Us is a campaign aimed at modernising Jesus Christ - and that the images used were actually shot by fine arts photographer Julia Fullerton  
During Super Bowl Sunday, a 60-second ad aired about Jesus Christ, and no one seemed angrier about it than Christians. The ad depicts a series of images of one person washing another person’s feet. 
A 30-second ad is estimated to cost about $7-8 million for Super Bowl 59, on top of the money it takes to create what are often elaborate commercials designed to grab headlines.

The He Gets Us campaign is returning to the Super Bowl with its “Foot Washing” commercial, which signifies a continued commitment to delivering profound, spiritually resonant messages on one of the world’s largest advertising stages. This choice to showcase an advert centered on humility and service during the Super Bowl, an event known  
Jesus Christ showed up at Super Bowl LVIII – and somehow, nobody was happy about it. Here's how and why it happened, and the surprising reasons why viewers f 
Called “Foot washing” and the work of Dallas-based creative agency LERMA, the AI-generated ad plays on the Christian egalitarian view of washing someone’s feet who is believed to be beneath you.

He Gets Us LLC ran a 60-second commercial featuring photos of foot washing, including a Latino police officer washing the feet of a young Black man, a White woman washing the feet of a young White girl outside a “Family Clinic,” and a White rancher-type man washing the feet of an elderly Indigenous man. 
The first viral Super Bowl commercial has to do with Jesus and people at home are confused. The first commercial break of the Super Bowl featured Jesus Christ. In an ad titled “Jesus washes feet” religious company HeGetsUs.com shows various photos of regular citizens washing each others feets. Text reading “Jesus didn’t teach hate, he

Ongoing updates of the latest Super Bowl 2025 commercials. 
While the controversial “He Gets Us” ad that aired during the Super Bowl stirred up plenty of conversation, pastor and author Mark Driscoll offered his own unfiltered take. In response to the 60-second “Foot Washing” ad, Driscoll, 53, tweeted, “Jesus washed Judas’s feet and still sent him to hell #HeGetsUs.” </p>
