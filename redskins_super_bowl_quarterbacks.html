        <p>The webpage lists the quarterbacks who have won Super Bowls for the Washington Redskins. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Theisman is the all-time Washington leader in passing yards (25,206), game-winning drives (22), and wins by a starting QB (77-47). Most importantly, he led the Redskins to their first Super Bowl title. In fact, he led them to consecutive Super Bowl appearances (XVII and XVIII).

Williams is best known for his performance with the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXII against the Denver Broncos, making him the first black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl. [2] He was named Super Bowl MVP after breaking two Super Bowl passing records: 340 yards total, and being the first to throw four touchdowns in a single  
Thirty-seven years ago on Jan. 31, 1988, Doug Williams stepped onto the field for Super Bowl XXII as the starting quarterback for the Washington Redskins (now Commanders) — and into history. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
This decision would go on to be one of the best in team history, as Williams would lead the Redskins all the way to a dominant 42-10 victory over the Broncos in Super Bowl XXII. Williams would be named Super Bowl MVP after tossing a then Super Bowl record four TD passes in the big game. 
The primary storyline surrounding Super Bowl XXII was that Washington's Doug Williams was the first African-American quarterback ever to start in a Super Bowl. This was even more meaningful given that the Redskins had been among the last teams to sign a black player after they reentered the league.

He played college football for the Washington State Cougars and was selected by the Washington Redskins in the sixth round of the 1986 NFL draft. He was the first Canadian-born quarterback to both start in the NFL and be named Super Bowl MVP, doing so in Super Bowl XXVI with the Redskins. He also played for several other NFL teams. 
The Commanders last won the Super Bowl title in 1992 when they played in Super Bowl XXVI. They played against the Buffalo Bills and defeated them by a score of 37-24. The game was played at the

Joe Theismann is the only other former Notre Dame quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl, leading the Washington Redskins to a 27-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the 17th big game. 
The Redskins posted a 14–2 regular season record, and led the league during the regular season with 485 points. Washington head coach Joe Gibbs entered the game seeking his third Super Bowl victory with the team, but with his third starting Super Bowl quarterback, Mark Rypien. 
That includes the 1991 season, the year Rypien led the Redskins to a 14-2 record and a Super Bowl ring. In that season, the quarterback threw for 3,564 yards and 28 touchdowns. That cemented his  </p>
