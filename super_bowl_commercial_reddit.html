Watch and discuss the best and worst ads from Super Bowl LVIII on Reddit. See clips, reactions, and comments from fans and celebrities on the 2024 Big Game commercials. 
The NFL gives teams $4,000 for each Super Bowl ring, and team owners spend their own money to improve them. The rings Chicago Bears players received from the McCaskey family for Super Bowl XX cost $4,000. 
Ahead of Super Bowl LIX (Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX), here are the 10 greatest Super Bowl commercials of all time. ADVERTISEMENT 10 best Super Bowl commercials of all time 
A funny ad goes a long way, or at least it did for two amateur advertisers who won Doritos' "Crash the Super Bowl" contest in 2009, an ad contest where the winning commercial was played during the  
The Kellogg School Super Bowl Advertising Review, an annual ranking from Northwestern University’s business school, reported shortly after the game on Sunday that Reddit’s commercial was among  
25. Nationwide Insurance — 'Boy' Super Bowl: 46 (Feb. 5, 2012) This is the most controversial one on the list, not because of its humor — because there isn't any — but because of its pure  
Super Bowl 2025 is right around the corner, with the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles poised to face off at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on February 9. Of course, the Super Bowl  
No, it wasn’t a glitch — for some Super Bowl viewers, a Reddit commercial really did pop up on the screen.. The spot, which was just five seconds, opened as if it were a car commercial, but  
Tide went meta when it bought an ad in every quarter of the 2018 Super Bowl. Each spot riffed a stereotypical Big Game commercial: a car ad, a beer ad, a deodorant ad, and more. 
Yeah I'm with this guy. You better check yourself before you fuck around with Tubi TV mister. Me and this guy will show up. Better think again before you mess with the "Tube Boys" which is a name that OP came up with and my nephew's parents are deeply worried about but I made sure to let them know it's just a couple guys who like to defend obscure streaming services on the internet. 
A reddit community dedicated to Tubi, a free streaming service for television, movies, and much more. Tubi is an American ad-supported streaming service owned by the Fox Corporation. 
The commercials are one of the best parts of the Super Bowl. Releasing them early is like opening presents before Christmas. Sure you have your new thing but it's not the same as opening it during the big day. 
I liked Larry David’s reluctance to new ideas a lot “I HAVE TEN FORKS RIGHT HERE!” And the NFL commercial where the video games characters came out. Lays with Seth and Paul was decent. I think the Super Bowl spots being the golden standard for commercials is no longer a thing. They’ve been flat for years now. Often just a few good ones. 
Based on the amazing attention to detail, it’s no wonder it was directed by Chase. Perfectly captured a drive down the Turnpike in 2022, including the scenes of those controversial new skinny buildings in Midtown Manhattan, the new World Trade Center in the rear view mirror, the new Goethals Bridge, and of course EZPass. 
Welcome to my 5th annual Super Bowl ads thread. Previous threads: 2020| 2019 | 2018 | 2017. I will start with ads past 6pm. Trailers will be in bold. Any extended/full versions of the videos will be the ones linked. If an ad is missing it might be a local ad, political ad, or an ad for the network (CBS) - so Paramount+, The Equalizer, Clarice. 
Super Bowl commercial!! upvotes  THIS ONE. A sub-reddit for the fans and critics of the show 30 Rock. Discussion of the show, pictures from the show and anything  
476 votes, 66 comments. true. during this year`s super bowl, one of the most popular commercials was a car commercial that served as a parody of the iconic sopranos opening. it even went the extra mile and had the actors who played meadow and AJ in it. upon seeing the commercial, my dad jokingly quipped "i guess they didn`t die in the finale". although that was likely said as a joke, it really  
Super Bowl commercials are stupid, too overhyped and they are just simply regular tv commercials with bigger bells and whistles!  r/Music — Reddit’s #1 Music  
The great Super Bowl commercials are the ones you still remember not matter how long they aired. To this day I still remember the Terry Tate Office Linebacker commercial and how hard it hit during a Super Bowl Party, everybody was laughing at that commercial. </p>
