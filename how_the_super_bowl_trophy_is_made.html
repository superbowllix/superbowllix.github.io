        <p>A new trophy has been crafted every year since Super Bowl I, made entirely of gleaming silver over the course of a painstaking four-month process at Tiffany’s workshop in Cumberland, Rhode Island. 
The iconic Vince Lombardi trophy, which is awarded to the winners of the Super Bowl each year, has an interesting history. It has been designed exclusively by Tiffany &amp; Co. since Super Bowl I in  
From afar, the Super Bowl trophy is nothing but a football in a kicking position. But as they say, the devil is in the details. For starters, the trophy is completely made of sterling silver — an alloy containing 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League's championship game, the Super Bowl. 
The “World Championship Game Trophy” was presented for the first time in 1967 to Vince Lombardi and the Green Bay Packers, who beat the Kansas City Chiefs in what was later called Super Bowl I. How Much Does the Lombardi Trophy Weigh, and What’s It Made Out of? 
Today, the trophy is made in Tiffany &amp; Co.’s hollowware shop in Rhode Island using traditional handcrafting methods. Work begins with an artisan “spinner”—who Reynolds says was trained by the

The trophy received its official name ahead of Super Bowl V in 1971. It was named for legendary coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victory in the first two Super Bowls. 
Metal spinners, silversmiths and engravers spend four months creating the trophy each year, a process that begins in a furnace heated to 1000°F. Next, it is melted, shaped, molded, carved and 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy has been the highest accolade in the football stratosphere for the past 57 years, since the Super Bowl was born in 1967. 
The iconic trophy is made of sterling silver and depicts a regulation-size football in kicking position on a pyramid-like base that features the words "Vince Lombardi Trophy" and "Super Bowl LIX  
The Vince Lombardi Trophy has been the highest accolade in the football stratosphere for the past 57 years, since the Super Bowl was born in 1967. 
A new trophy has been crafted every year since Super Bowl I, made entirely of gleaming silver over the course of a painstaking four-month process at Tiffany’s workshop in Cumberland, Rhode Island. It’s forged in fire that reaches temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, then hand-soldered and polished to its incomparable sheen. 
Who makes the Lombardi Trophy? The Lombardi Trophy is made by Tiffany &amp; Co., a luxury jewelry company based in New York City. They have created the trophy every year since the Super Bowl began. 
The Vince Lombardi Trophy is the award received by the victorious team following the NFL’s championship game, the Super Bowl. Currently, there are two teams tied for possessing the most Lombardi  
Weighing in at seven pounds, the trophy stands 21 inches tall and is made of sterling silver. Once the trophy is made, it resides at the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s “Lamar Hunt Super Bowl  
A Lancaster County jeweler once was one of the craftsmen responsible for creating the Lombardi Trophy, awarded to the winner of the NFL's Super Bowl each year. Stephanie Perrotti, of Mount Joy, is  
The Super Bowl LI trophy is on display at the Patriots Hall of Fame, but it won’t be there for long; it’s scheduled to head back to Cumberland to be engraved any day now. 
We have made the iconic Vince Lombardi Trophy®, presented annually to the NFL® Super Bowl® championship team, since the first Super Bowl® in 1967. Oscar Riedener, a former Tiffany &amp; Co. Vice President, sketched the basic design for the trophy on a napkin during a 1966 meeting with then-NFL® Commissioner Pete Rozelle, and the rest was history. </p>
