        <p>The youngest quarterback in Eagles history to start a Super Bowl back in 2022, he's hoping to secure his first ring in a second go-round with Mahomes at age 26. Our Latest NFL Stories 
Super Bowl LVII also marked the first time that both Super Bowl starting quarterbacks were black: Patrick Mahomes started for the Kansas City Chiefs, while Jalen Hurts started for the Philadelphia Eagles. [30] [32] The Eagles are the first team to have two different black starting quarterbacks start a Super Bowl. 
Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320  
Russell Wilson, who holds the record for most wins by a quarterback in his first nine seasons, was also the first of only two Black quarterbacks in NFL history to appear in multiple Super Bowls  
He dazzled in Super Bowl LVII, totaling 35 touchdowns that season and rushing for an NFL-best 13 scores by a quarterback. Despite his heroic effort, the Eagles fell 38-35 to Mahomes’ Chiefs. 
Patrick Mahomes is the third and most recent Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl and earn the Super Bowl MVP title. Following the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs to a 31-20 Super Bowl 54 win against the San Francisco 49ers, completing 26 of 42 passes for 286 yards with two touchdown passes. 
Williams is best known for his performance with the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXII against the Denver Broncos, making him the first black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl. [2] He was named Super Bowl MVP after breaking two Super Bowl passing records: 340 yards total, and being the first to throw four touchdowns in a single  
Two more Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl since: Russell Wilson with the Seattle Seahawks in 2014 and Patrick Mahomes with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020. Williams was the first, a  
Running back Timmy Smith added a Super Bowl-record 204 yards on the ground to round out the most impressive offensive display in Super Bowl history. But for all the highlight-reel displays, it was  
For 27-year-old Chiefs quarterback Mahomes – who is looking for his second Super Bowl ring when the two teams face off in Arizona on February 12, which would make him the first Black quarterback  
From 1988 to 2019, five more Black quarterbacks played the Super Bowl, but only Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks led his team to a win – 43-8 against the Denver Broncos (just like Doug Williams) in Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014. He and the team returned to the Super Bowl in 2015 but failed to beat the New England Patriots. 
Ben Roethlisberger won two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 and 2009, becoming one of the youngest quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl in his first victory. “Big Ben” was known  
It was the Redskins’ second Super Bowl win in six seasons, and coincidentally, their second Super Bowl win in a strike-season. Redskins quarterback Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to start in a Super Bowl and was the only individual to have emerged victorious until Russell Wilson won Super Bowl XLVIII with the Seattle Seahawks. 
For many, Williams winning the Super Bowl remains the most singular achievement by a Black QB. It is on par with Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball and Jesse Owens winning the  
Flacco and Foles are backups. Wilson's future got off to an ugly start. Meanwhile, Mahomes only needs one more Super Bowl win to be one of the all time top five for most SB wins, and he's only 27 years old! It'll be very exciting to see which of the rising stars at QB win a ring in years to come. Allen? Burrow? Herbert? Hurts? 
It is no secret that being the ultimate team game or not, the quarterback will generally unduly endure the brunt of the blame for a Super Bowl loss but oftentimes bask in the glory of winning the Super Bowl ring. Here is a complete list of the starting QBs that took center stage after their team won in the first 58 editions of the Super Bowl. 
Editor’s note: This post has been updated with new information. With the 2025 Super Bowl on the way, we’ll soon know if a new NFL quarterback will join the eternal list of Super Bowl champions. 
Quarterback Tom Brady has won the most NFL championships, with seven. Tom Brady (quarterback) won Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LIII with the New England Patriots after the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2018 seasons, respectively. [1] He won Super Bowl LV with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the 2020 season. [2] 
Tom Brady has more rings than any player in NFL history after winning a seventh championship in Super Bowl 55. The Buccaneers quarterback already had an NFL-leading six Super Bowl victories after
