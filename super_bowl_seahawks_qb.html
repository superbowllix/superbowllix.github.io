Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson threw for over 200 yards and two touchdowns in Super Bowl XLVIII. 
Super Bowl XLVIII was the first Super Bowl held at an open-air stadium in a "cold-weather" city; previous Super Bowls in cold-weather cities were held at indoor stadiums. However, the temperature at kickoff was a mild 49 °F (9 °C), making this only the third-coldest Super Bowl. [37] A major snow storm hit the area the very next day. [38]

As the perfect blend of passer and scrambler, Wilson's unique skill set has undoubtedly etched him into the annals of Seattle sports lore.
