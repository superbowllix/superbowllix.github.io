        <p>Thursday marks 20 years since the Super Bowl arrived in Jacksonville. The Times-Union looks back at the city's biggest-ever NFL event. 
[81] [82] The Jaguars signed Super Bowl LII MVP quarterback Nick Foles prior to the 2019 season. [83] However, Foles was lost for most of the season from a broken collarbone suffered in Week 1 against the Chiefs. [84] The team turned to 2019 sixth-round draft pick Gardner Minshew, who filled in for most of the 6–10 season. 
The Jacksonville Jaguars have not yet reached the Super Bowl, as of December 2024. In fact, they are one of the four teams that have not yet appeared in the Super Bowls.

Jacksonville Jaguars All-Time Super Bowl Record The Jaguars currently hold a 0-0 record in the Super Bowl as they have never made an appearance. Their most recent playoff run ended in the AFC Championship in 2018 (after the 2017 regular season), which they lost to the New England Patriots 24-20.

The Jacksonville Jaguars are approaching 30 years as a franchise, and they're still looking for their first championship. One of 13 teams to never have won the Super Bowl, the Jags are actually part of a much more exclusive club as one of just four teams who have never played in the big game. 
Jacksonville went toe-to-toe with the Tom Brady-led Patriots team in the Conference Championship after the 2017 season, but the Pats outscored the Jags 14-3 in the fourth quarter. How Many Super Bowls Have the Jaguars Won? Zero. When Was the Last Time the Jaguars Made the Super Bowl? I’m sorry Jags fans, we’re not trying to beat a dead horse. 
Sunday's game will be the first time that a reigning Super Bowl champ invades EverBank Stadium since the Denver Broncos — by then without the retired Peyton Manning — took on the Jags in 2016. 
The Jacksonville Jaguars aren't in the Super Bowl, but that didn't stop owner Shad Khan from making the trip to the biggest football game of the year.. Kismet, Khan's megayacht, is docked in New  
That became evident when Jacksonville hosted Super Bowl 39 in 2005. With that, here are five locations I believe will host Super Bowls from 2029-33. 2029: AT&amp;T Stadium, Dallas Cowboys 
So, five years after the Jaguars took the field in Sept. 1995, he went big-game hunting for another impactful football experience: Jacksonville hosting a Super Bowl.

The Jacksonville Jaguars are one of just four NFL teams to have never made it to the Super Bowl, but it seems that their owner will be making an appearance this year. Shad Khan has been spotted on the waterfront in New Orleans this week and the billionaire owner certainly isn’t hiding in the city. 
JACKSONVILLE –The Jacksonville Jaguars have hired two-time Super Bowl champion and former NFL QB Doug Pederson as head coach, the team announced today. "Doug Pederson four years ago won a Super Bowl as head coach of a franchise in pursuit of its first world championship," Owner Shad Khan said.
