        <h2><strong>super bowl halftime artists pay miami super bowl shakira</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl halftime performers are paid the union-rate minimum. For Usher, that meant $671 for the actual performance last year and about $1,800 for the rehearsals leading up to the Super Bowl. 
Even during the 2021 Super Bowl, when COVID restrictions meant the set was not as lavish as in previous years, the Weeknd's manager told Billboard the artist invested $7 million of his own money  
It makes total sense when you consider artists drop the number of zeros from their usual invoice for the same reason companies will pay $6.5 million for a 30-second ad this year. The Super Bowl is the most-watched event on television, drawing millions of viewers each year. 
How much does the Super Bowl halftime cost? An elaborate production like the halftime show costs the NFL up to $10m, according to Forbes and in 2021, The Weeknd reportedly spent $7m of his own  
How much do artists get paid for the Super Bowl Halftime Show? As it turns out, artists do not get paid for the Super Bowl Halftime Show—at least not by the NFL. The NFL does, however, cover all  
The 2024 Super Bowl half-time show will be headlined by Usher, the R&amp;B superstar known for hits like 'U Remind Me,' 'My Boo,' 'Burn,' 'Love in This Club,' and 'Yeah!'. 
Why do artists perform at the Super Bowl without pay? Katy Perry performs with dancers during the Pepsi Super Bowl XLIX Halftime Show at University of Phoenix Stadium on February 1, 2015. Rob Carr  
The surprising truth is that halftime performers aren’t paid to perform at the Super Bowl. Per league policy, the NFL covers all costs related to the production of the halftime show, but the  
NFL vice president of communications Brian McCarthy told Newsweek in 2022 that the league doesn't pay halftime performers an "appearance fee, but the artists are indeed paid union scale." But  
The truth is, artists who perform at a Super Bowl halftime historically make nothing. In a 2016 interview with Forbes , NFL spokesperson Joanna Hunter said: “We do not pay the artists. We cover  
With over 100 million viewers watching, the Super Bowl halftime show carries immense value—so much so that the NFL once explored whether artists would pay for the opportunity. When Beyoncé performed in 2013 without compensation, sources revealed the production costs reached approximately $600,000. 
Kendrick Lamar performs during halftime of the NFL Super Bowl 56 football game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022, in Inglewood, Calif. (AP Photo/Julio  
Artists perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show for free, but with 100 million viewers, the exposure drives spikes in music sales, streams, and tours. 
According to a Sports Illustrated report, Usher was paid "$671 for the actual performance last year and about $1,800 for the rehearsals leading up to the Super Bowl." Still, "the halftime show at

Super Bowl LVIII will air on Sunday, February 11, 2024. Usher will be the Super Bowl Sunday performer. But how much do Super Bowl halftime performers get paid? </p>
