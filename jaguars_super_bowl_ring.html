The Super Bowl ring is an award in the National Football League given to the team members of the winning team of the league's annual championship game, the Super Bowl. 
Super Bowl rings are the ultimate sign of credibility in the pro football world. The ring is the thing, but the symbolism behind these coveted pieces of jewelry is important, too. Behind the dazzling diamonds and gold lie memories of the blood, sweat, tears and hard work it took to achieve victory on the NFL’s biggest stage.
