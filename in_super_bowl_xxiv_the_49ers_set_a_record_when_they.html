The Broncos played the 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV on Sunday, January 28, 1990. The 49ers entered the game looking to defend their previous year's championship against the Broncos. The Broncos entered the game with a record of 11-5-0, while the 49ers entered the game with a record of 14-2-0. 
The San Francisco 49ers beat the Denver Broncos 55-10 in the biggest blowout in Super Bowl history in the seventh championship game in New Orleans. 
Super Bowl XXIV was an American football game played on January 28, 1990 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion following the 1989 regular season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers (17–2) won their fourth Super Bowl by defeating the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos  
In this Jan. 28, 1990, file photo, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana raises his football helmet toward the crowd as he leaves the field following the team's 55-10 victory over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans, La. Montana set five Super Bowl career records, including his third Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award, and San Francisco's point total was the most ever. 
They held off a Cleveland rally to win 37-21, and they were headed to their fourth Super Bowl in the last 13 years. Quarterback John Elway threw for over 3,000 yards, but he was inconsistent. He threw 18 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. 
The 49ers entered the game seeking to win their second straight Super Bowl. Bill Walsh retired as head coach after San Francisco's 20–16 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in the previous year's Super Bowl, but rookie head coach George Seifert did not miss a beat, as he guided the 49ers to a league-best 14–2 regular season record. 
The Super Bowl is where legends are born, but it’s also where some teams set records that seem untouchable. Among them, one still stands at the top: the highest number of points scored. That honor belongs to the San Francisco 49ers, who delivered a masterclass in absolute dominance during Super  
As mentioned, the Niners did more than anyone to push that average above 30 points at Super Bowls XXIV and XXIX. They also exceeded it at Super Bowl XIX when overcoming the Miami Dolphins 38-16 but were below average when winning at XVI (26-21) and XXIII (20-16), both against the Cincinnati Bengals. 
The 49ers’ 55-10 victory over the Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV before a crowd of 72,919 at the Superdome wasn’t just the most blindsided playoff performance since the Washington Redskins spotted  
Before they took the field against the Denver Broncos, the San Francisco 49ers prepared for the Super Bowl the best way they knew how. Some of them, like Bubba Paris, geared up for the trenches. Others, like Joe Montana, thought about their families. Then the 49ers went out and answered the call to glory 
Super Bowl XXIV was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers and the American Football Conference ( </p>
