        <h2><strong>super bowl compared to world cup super bowl tickets price vip</strong></h2>
        <p>It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. In comparison, Super Bowl LVIII between the Chiefs and 49ers had an audience of 123.7 million people  
The World Cup winners’ haul looks handsome compared to the $164,000 each member of the Chiefs’ Super Bowl-winning team received from the NFL in 2024. San Francisco 49ers players took in around  
Both the Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup have established themselves as iconic events with rich legacies that go beyond just the games themselves.

The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
The Super Bowl pulls in larger sums of TV advertising revenue than the World Cup, and there are a number of reasons attributed to this. For one thing, the United States is one of the biggest advertising markets in the world, so its advertising revenues would of course be significantly higher.

The FIFA World Cup Final in 2018, which featured young phenom Kylian Mbappe and France defeating Croatia by a thrilling score of 4-2, had 3.57 billion viewers, per FIFA. For comparison, the 2022  
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
Still, a more precise World Cup audience average would still be more than the Super Bowl, but that’s a function of the final airing on hundreds of channels across the entire planet. 
Moreover, after the game ended, many fans compared the clash to the 2022 FIFA World Cup final. For the unversed, during the FIFA finale, Lionel Messi’s Argentina defeated France in one of the greatest games in the history of soccer.
