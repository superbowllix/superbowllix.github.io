Hall of Fame offensive guard Gene Upshaw of the Oakland Raiders played in Super Bowl II in 1968, Super Bowl XI in 1977 and Super Bowl XV in 1981. As a member of the San Francisco 49ers, Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice appeared in Super Bowl XXIII in 1989, Super Bowl XXIV in 1990 and Super Bowl XXIX in 1995. 
Jim Kelly started four Super Bowls without winning any, a record. He's one of eight quarterbacks who have started at least four Super Bowls. Super Bowl wins are often used to determine the greatness of a quarterback. [1] Of the eligible players, only Jim Plunkett has won multiple Super Bowls and not been inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
The Giants’ other Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks, Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, are not in the Hall of Fame, although Simms’ regular-season record with the franchise, 95-64, was superior to  
Jim Kelly: Hall of Fame class of 2002. It’s a real shame that Kelly is on this list considering he led the Buffalo Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances. Let me say that again. He led the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances. For a team to even make one Super Bowl, let alone four in a row, is unheard of. Unfortunately

Manning could join his brother Peyton, who also won two Super Bowls but is considered to be among the best of the 27 modern-era quarterbacks in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
The Hall of Fame quarterback led the Bills to the playoffs in eight of his 11 seasons and to the Super Bowl four consecutive times from 1991 to '94 but couldn't win any of the four games. 
By far, the greatest quarterback to never win a Super Bowl. He had a groundbreaking 1984 season, setting records with 5,084 passing yards and 48 touchdowns. Over his career, Marino led in passing yards five times and touchdowns three times, retiring with 61,361 yards and 420 touchdowns, rankings that still place him in the top 10.

The Giants’ other Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks, Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, are not in the Hall of Fame, although Simms’ regular-season record with the franchise, 95-64, was superior to  
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Accolades: Two-time Super Bowl champion, Super Bowl MVP, and two-time Pro Bowl selection Phil Simms gained a lot of early criticism despite playing with inferior talent for the New York Giants. By 1985, Simms grew into a Pro Bowl talent, and in the next season, he led the Giants to their first Super Bowl victory. 
The Super Bowl is a legacy game for quarterbacks as a good career paired with a Lombardi Trophy or two is often the key to a fast track to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Patrick Mahomes has taken  
In 2023, the Chiefs reached the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, securing Mahomes his second Lombardi Trophy. Currently positioned as the primary contender to Tom Brady’s seven titles, Mahomes has an opportunity to win his third Super Bowl on February 11, 2024, when the Chiefs take on San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII.

The history of Super Bowl quarterbacks dates back to 1967 at Super Bowl I when Bart Starr led the Green Bay Packers to a championship. From there on, the list of super bowl winning QBs has grown. 
Buffalo’s Jim Kelly and Miami’s Dan Marino had spectacular Hall of Fame careers, but neither quarterback won a Super Bowl. Those are gaping holes in their resumés, and Kelly had to deal with  </p>
