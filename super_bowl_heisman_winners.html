        <h2><strong>super bowl heisman winners last time super bowl game went into overtime</strong></h2>
        <p>2016 was the last time a Heisman winner made the Super Bowl behind Cam Newton’s MVP season. This year could see 2008 winner, Mark Ingram, join this list as the New Orleans Saints are one of the  
Most passing yards by a Heisman winner in a Super Bowl. 265 – Cam Newton, 2016. Most TD passes by a Heisman winner in a Super Bowl. 3 – Jim Plunkett (1981), Roger Staubach (1979) Most TDs scored by a Heisman winner in a Super Bowl. 2 – Marcus Allen (1984), Eddie George (2000) Most receptions by a Heisman winner in a Super Bowl. 7  
Similarly, Cam Newton, the 2010 Heisman winner from Auburn, guided the Carolina Panthers to Super Bowl 50 but was defeated by Peyton Manning’s Denver Broncos. An Exclusive Club in NFL History 
There have only been 10 Heisman winners to win a Super Bowl, which is a shockingly low number. Paul Hornung, Roger Staubach, Mike Garrett, Jim Plunkett, Tony Dorsett, Marcus Allen, George Rogers  
The Heisman Trophy, one of the highest individual awards in American college football, has been awarded annually since its creation in 1935.The trophy is given to the most outstanding college football player in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), and is awarded by the Heisman Trust, successors of the awards from the Downtown Athletic  
Allen easily has claim to the greatest Super Bowl performance from a Heisman. The former USC Trojan popped off for 191 rushing yards and two touchdowns on just 20 carries to win MVP honors. Allen remains the only player in NFL history to have won the Heisman, a national title, NFL MVP, a Super Bowl and Super Bowl MVP. Redskins RB George Rogers  
Overall, Heisman winners have appeared on Super Bowl rosters 27 times while a combined 10 won 12 Super Bowls (Roger Staubach and Jim Plunkett being the only repeat winners). Here are the guys who won both a Heisman and a Super Bowl: Paul Hornung, Roger Staubach, Mike Garrett, Jim Plunkett, Tony Dorsett, Marcus Allen, George Rogers, Desmond  
Heisman-winning season: 2010 College: Auburn Game: Super Bowl 50 Newton has the opportunity to reach very exclusive company with a win in Super Bowl 50.Only Marcus Allen has won a Heisman Trophy  
We’re officially in Super Bowl week! Next Sunday, Feb. 7, Cam Newton will become the latest Heisman Trophy winner to play in a Super Bowl. Here is a look at how past Heisman winners fared in the big game: Super Bowl I, 1967 – Mike Garrett (Kansas City), Paul Hornung(Green Bay) Kansas City tailback Mike Garrett carried six times for 17 yards [] 
A Heisman winner would not win another Super Bowl MVP award until Desmond Howard did so while playing for the Packers in the 1997 Super Bowl. Howard was the first special teams player to win MVP honors after totaling 244 return yards (including a 99-yard kickoff return touchdown) as Green Bay downed New England, 35-21. 
Three players have won the Heisman Trophy, national championship and Super Bowl.  The next season, Dorsett was a 1,000-yard rusher for a Super Bowl winner as a rookie. The Dallas Cowboys  
The Heisman-related trivia question for the week is who was the last Heisman winner to win a Super Bowl and the answer, for the 13th straight year, is Charles Woodson. Woodson, while a member of the Green Bay Packers, earned his ring in 2011 at Super Bowl XLV. Lamar Jackson was the last Heisman winner [] 
The fourth and the most recent Heisman winner to win the Super Bowl MVP is Desmond Howard who won the Heisman as a wide receiver for the Michigan Wolverines in 1991 but made his impact for the  
Allen became the fourth USC running back to win the Heisman while becoming the first player to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season. He is arguably the most decorated player in the history of football as he is the only player to win a national title, a Heisman, a Super Bowl, a Super Bowl MVP award and an NFL regular-season MVP award. 
A new edition of the Super Bowl is approaching, bringing with it some intriguing historical facts. In this case, here at Bolavip, we’ll take a look at those quarterbacks who not only had the privilege of winning the Vince Lombardi Trophy but have also been honored with the prestigious Heisman  
For the third time in the last four years, the Super Bowl will feature a Heisman Trophy winner and for the second time in three years, it will be 2020 trophy recipient DeVonta Smith. Smith, now a grizzled four-year veteran, first helped the Philadelphia Eagles reach Super Bowl LVII in February of 2023, but they [] 
Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson (2016) and Tampa Bay Buccaneer signal-caller Baker Mayfield (2017) will lace ‘em up this weekend as both are trying to become the first Heisman Trophy winner to win a Super Bowl since Charles Woodson (1997) in Super Bowl XLV in 2011. The streak came close to ending in each of the past two seasons. 
In fact, winning Super Bowl teams have featured a Heisman winner on the roster only nine times. The last Heisman winner to claim a ring before Woodson was fellow Packer Desmond Howard, who earned MVP honors in Super Bowl XXXI in 1997 thanks to his 99-yard kickoff return for a score. He is the only special teams player to win the MVP honor  
There are 10 players who won the Heisman and then went on to win the Super Bowl: Paul Hornung, Roger Staubach, Mike Garrett, Jim Plunkett, Tony Dorsett, Marcus Allen, George Rogers, Desmond Howard  
Heisman winners in the NFL turned in prolific 2024 regular seasons and six of the 11 active Heisman pros are set for the postseason. No Heisman winner has won a Super Bowl since Charles Woodson with Green Bay in 2011. Six will take another crack at it this year, including Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson and Derrick [] </p>
