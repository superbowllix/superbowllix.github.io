In front of a Super Bowl-record crowd of 103,424, the Raiders set Super Bowl records with 266 rushing yards and 429 yards of offense in the highest-scoring game in the 11-year history of the event. 
The Minnesota Vikings have fallen short 4 times in Super Bowls all-time. 
The Vikings have made four trips to the Super Bowl in their 57 years as a team. Minnesota's first appearance in the Super Bowl was Super Bowl IV in 1970 when the Chiefs toppled the Vikings 23-7. 
In 2024, the Minnesota Vikings lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card Round. What years did the Vikings make the Super Bowl? The Minnesota Vikings have appeared in the Super Bowl 4 times, in 1969, 1973, 1974 and 1976. 
The Minnesota Vikings last lost the Super Bowl in the 1976 season. The Vikings lost to the Oakland Raiders by a score of 32-14.

The Vikings played in their second straight Super Bowl, Super Bowl IX (3rd overall), losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 16–6, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans on January 12, 1975. [ 22 ] [ 1 ] Led by Tarkenton and running back Chuck Foreman , the 1975 Vikings got off to a 10–0 start and easily won another division title. 
Have the Vikings Ever Won the Super Bowl? No. The Minnesota Vikings have never won the Super Bowl. The Vikings have reached the Super Bowl a total of four times (1970, 1974, 1975, and 1977) but have never won. They are one of two teams in NFL history that have reached the Super Bowl four times without a win. The other is the Buffalo Bills. 
The Minnesota Vikings have been beaten 4 times in Super Bowls all-time. 
When Was the Last Time the Vikings Made the Super Bowl? Minnesota last went to a Super Bowl almost 50 years ago. In 1976, led by Rookie of the Year Sammy White and All-Pro Chuck Foreman, they made it to Super Bowl 11, their third Super Bowl appearance in four seasons, but lost in humiliating fashion to the Raiders 32-14. 
The Minnesota Vikings have 4 games played in Super Bowls all-time.  What was the Vikings ATS record last year?  washington redskins super bowl appearances. 4 . 
While the Minnesota Vikings were a dominant force in the 1970s with four Super Bowl appearances, the franchise failed to win in any of the four games. When was the last Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl win? The Minnesota Vikings are yet to win a Super Bowl despite reaching the NFL's biggest game on four occasions. 
In the last 10 years, five of the 20 participating Super Bowl teams did not make the playoffs in the previous season. That's 25%, a rather sizable number. Because of that figure, I will split this  
Minnesota’s players had many more years of experience, but they were older and just slightly slower in several key spots. One most common denominator in all of the Vikings’ Super Bowl losses were turnovers. Minnesota turned the ball over a total of 15 times in their four Super Bowl games. In Super Bowl IX, they committed five costly turnovers. 
1969: Lost Super Bowl 4 vs. Chiefs 7-23 1973: Lost Super Bowl 8 vs. Dolphins 7-24 1974: Lost Super Bowl 9 vs. Steelers 6-16 1976: Lost Super Bowl 11 vs. Raiders 14-32 1977: Lost NFC Championship vs. Cowboys 6-23 1987: Lost NFC Championship vs. Redskins 10-17 1998: Lost NFC Championship vs. Falcons 27-30 OT 
Those other times when things went wrong — we’re talking four Super Bowl losses plus 1998, 2000, 2009 and 2017 — weren’t solid opportunities. This time, the NFC playoff field is flawed.
