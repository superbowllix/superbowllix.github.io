        <p>2. Stanford University. They make athletes smarter at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, evidently. Two victorious alumni of the Stanford Cardinal have three Super Bowl rings between them: Former Denver Broncos star John Elway has two (Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII in 1997 and 1998, respectively), while Jim Plunkett also won two as the quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams in 1981 in  
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl.

Here is the trivia question: Name the five colleges that have produced both a president of the United States AND a Super Bowl-winning quarterback (You're going to want to make sure to memorize  
But here’s what the exercise taught me. How many schools have had multiple Super Bowl-winning QBs. It’s amazing how some schools have excelled at producing the triggerman in the 45 Super Bowls. For instance, six of the first eight Super Bowls and seven of the first 11 were won by quarterbacks from Alabama or Purdue. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Joe Montana remains for many the standard-bearer of championship NFL quarterback play, winning four Super Bowls with the 49ers (XVI, XIX, XXIII, XXIV), while Joe Theismann won Super Bowl XVII with

Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles 
Trivia timeout: Can you name the four schools that have produced a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and a U.S. president?  Didn't think so, but that's about to change  The answers: The U.S  
How many Super Bowl winning starting quarterbacks has your school produced? How many wins can they each brag about? That's going to mean something different in the near future with all the transfers and movements in the college game - Wisconsin gets credit for Russell Wilson, not NC State, and of course UCLA can claim Troy Aikman, not Oklahoma - but it's all fairly obvious.

Losing a Super Bowl in his sophomore season despite having Swiss cheese for an offensive line against the most fearsome defensive front in the League does not mean he isn't the real deal. If any number of plays in that game goes the other way, Burrow would've been SB MVP. 
Since the five schools have been named, I'll come in with the easy task of naming the Presidents and Quarterbacks: Miami - President Benjamin Harrison, QB Ben Roethlisberger Stanford - President Herbert Hoover, QB Jim Plunkett, QB John Elway Michigan - President Gerald Ford, QB Tom Brady Navy - President Jimmy Carter, QB Roger Staubach
