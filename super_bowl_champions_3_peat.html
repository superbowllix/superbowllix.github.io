        <p>Here's looking back at how the previous Super Bowl three-peat attempts were dashed over the past 58 years.  Dallas Cowboys, 1994 (12-4, lost in NFC championship) 
Here are the nine teams who have had a chance to three-peat as Super Bowl champions and their final result: 1968 Packers: 6-7-1, missed playoffs; 1974 Dolphins: 11-3, lost in divisional round; 
Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Andy Reid and the Chiefs are trying to re-write the record books. Kansas City was crowned back-to-back Super Bowl champions with its thrilling overtime win over the  
The Kansas City Chiefs will try for a "three-peat" in 2024 after they beat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 58 to become pro football's first repeat champion in two decades. 
Two-time defending Super Bowl champions who failed to three-peat include the Green Bay Packers , Miami Dolphins , Pittsburgh Steelers (twice: 1976, 1980), San Francisco 49ers , Dallas Cowboys , Denver Broncos , and New England Patriots . All of these teams failed to return to the title game in the third season (indicated in parentheses). 
The Chiefs have at least the look of a team capable of being the first NFL team to ever 3-peat as Super Bowl champions. They enter the NFL Playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the AFC once again and will  
The Packers may have missed out on being the first 3-peat Super Bowl champions by a single year. The Super Bowl was invented when the NFL and AFL agreed to merge before the 1966 season. At this time the Packers were nearing the end of a dynastic run, and managed to win the first two installments of the Super Bowl by blowing out their AFL  
The NFL has never had a team win three consecutive Super Bowls, making the modern-day football three-peat one of the most elusive championship pinnacles in sports.. The Kansas City Chiefs are now  
The Kansas City Chiefs are already in elite company as back-to-back Super Bowl champions. They're two wins away, however, from becoming the first team to three-peat in the Super Bowl era. Prior to  
The Three-peat try: Following Super Bowl II, Lombardi stepped down as coach, though he remained as GM for this season. Long time defensive coordinator Phil Bengtson took over as coach, but the Packers were unable to keep it together, going 6-7-1 in 1968, including a miserable 1-4-1 in a NFL Central division won by 8-6 Minnesota. 
The Chiefs are embracing their opportunity to become the NFL's first 3-peat champion  they are representing the AFC in the Super Bowl for the fifth time in the last six years, with the lone

In 1966, Green Bay beat Dallas 34-27 in the NFL championship before routing AFL champion Kansas City 35-10 in Super Bowl I. Starr was named Super Bowl MVP after passing for 250 yards with two TDs  
COMEBACK KID. Patrick Mahomes is truly the comeback kid in the postseason after rallying the Chiefs for his third Super Bowl title in five seasons.. Mahomes has trailed by double-digits in all three of his Super Bowl wins, also leading comebacks against the 49ers in the 2019 season and Philadelphia last season. 
The NFL’s first-ever three-peat is in sight for the Chiefs, but the Eagles stand in their way. The teams face off Sunday in Super Bowl LIX from New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome, a rematch of  
“The Chiefs are the first team to play in the Super Bowl while seeking a Super Bowl three-peat, but other teams have come close to winning three straight championships without finishing the job. The 1966 Buffalo Bills went 9-4-1 and faced Kansas City for a third straight AFL title and the right to face the Packers in the first ever Super Bowl. 
Setting an arbitrary cutoff at the first Super Bowl would ignore history and call this a back-to-back run with a failed three-peat. However, the Super Bowl II ring has three diamonds in it to  
Coaches, athletes share accounts of achieving the championship three-peat, or coming agonizingly close.  Trevor Pryce, former DT, Denver Broncos, Super Bowl champions 1997, 1998. 
After the Chiefs' Super Bowl victory in February, Mahomes said a three-peat would be "legendary." For Kramer, winning three straight was one of the biggest achievements of his football career. In his basement, next to the poker table, hangs a Sports Illustrated cover from Jan. 22, 1968.
