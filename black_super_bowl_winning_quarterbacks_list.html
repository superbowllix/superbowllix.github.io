        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
In the National Football League’s (NFL) history, three Black quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. In 1988, Doug Williams, who played for Washington, made history as the first Black QB to win the NFL’s biggest game. Decades later, Russell Wilson would lead the Seattle Seahawks to victory in 2014 and, most recently, Patrick Mahomes of Kansas City won 2019’s Super Bowl after a standout  
Black quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl. Three Black quarterbacks have hoisted the Lombardi Trophy: Williams, Wilson, and Mahomes. Williams and Mahomes also nabbed MVP honors in the big game  
And his veteran-level poise was even more apparent in 2013, when he guided a 13-3 finish and became the third-youngest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl, controlling the ball as the Seahawks  
Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was the seventh black quarterback to start a Super Bowl. [30] The combined Super Bowl records of black quarterbacks is 5–7. Williams and Mahomes are to date the only players to win the Super Bowl MVP award. [31] 
Washington won 42-10, and Williams was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to start in and win any NFL championship game, including those before the Super Bowl was established. 
Patrick Mahomes is the third and most recent Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl and earn the Super Bowl MVP title. Following the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs to a 31-20 Super Bowl 54 win against the San Francisco 49ers, completing 26 of 42 passes for 286 yards with two touchdown passes. 
In 2023, the Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35, making Mahomes the only Black quarterback to win two Super Bowls. His first win is like Deja Vu, in 2020 Mahomes and the Chiefs beat the San  
In Super Bowl XXII, he threw for 340 yards and four touchdowns, earning MVP honors. His legacy as a pioneer for Black quarterbacks remains unmatched. Steve McNair (Tennessee Titans) – SB XXXIV  
Before he would go on to become the first Black quarterback to win MVP, and after he was the last player from an HBCU to be a Heisman finalist, Steve McNair made a Super Bowl appearance between  
The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom Brady leads the pack with seven titles, three clear of any other quarterback, while  
There was also Doug Williams, who led Washington past the Broncos in 1988 to become the first black quarterback to win the Super Bowl. These athletes excel as black QBs in the NFL. The reputations of black quarterbacks in the NFL are marked by groundbreaking careers and incredible athleticism. 
Below is a list of the Super Bowl winning quarterbacks from every year that the big game has taken place. Bart Starr leads this list, as he won back-to-back Super Bowls with the Green Bay Packers  
Mahomes is the youngest player ever to win an NFL MVP, a Super Bowl MVP, and a Super Bowl. He was 24 when he first achieved that. He is a Black quarterback. 
T here have been 820 quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era — 34 have won a Super Bowl; and 13 have won more than one Super Bowl. If Patrick Mahomes wins next Sunday, he will join Troy Aikman (3), Terry Bradshaw (4), Joe Montana (4), and Tom Brady (7) as the only quarterbacks to win three or more Super Bowls. 
The first Black quarterback to start a Super Bowl was also the first to be taken in the first round of the NFL Draft.. Selected by Tampa Bay with the No. 17 overall pick in 1978, Doug Williams took the Buccaneers to the postseason three times in five years before a messy divorce led to his exit from the NFL. 
Washington won 42-10, and Williams was named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the first Black quarterback to start in and win any NFL championship game, including those before the Super Bowl was established.
