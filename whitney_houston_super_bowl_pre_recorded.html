        <p>Traditionally performed at sports games in the US, "The Star-Spangled Banner" was performed by Houston at the original Tampa Stadium for Super Bowl XXV in 1991. Although Houston was singing live, she was singing into a dead microphone, and television viewers were hearing a non-live pre-recorded version of the anthem due to her musical director  
It was what turned a star into a superstar: Whitney Houston's mesmerizing rendition of the national anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl. Houston's powerful "Star Spangled Banner" performance came at a  
The pre-recorded version that is almost entirely from that first take ended up being the audio used on the day of the Super Bowl, despite Houston still singing live on the field. 
This was the case with the most iconic Super Bowl national anthem performance of all time, Whitney Houston's soaring 1991 rendition. A recording was used from Houston's first take in the studio  
2004, Super Bowl XXXVIII . Fresh off the release of her first solo album Dangerously in Love, Bey returned to her hometown of Houston, Texas, to perform before one of the most exciting games in the history of the Super Bowl. Prior to the New England Patriots beating the Carolina Panthers by three points and the very controversial halftime show  
HOUSTON WAS 27 when she sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Super Bowl XXV. She was already the first artist in history to have seven consecutive singles go to No. 1 on Billboard 's Hot 100 pop chart. 
According to Whitney Houston's long-time producer Rickey Minor, Houston pre-recorded the national anthem, which was then played at the 1991 Super Bowl while Houston sang into an unamplified mic. This fact brief is responsive to conversations such as this one . 
Whitney Houston's rendition of the national anthem before the 25th Super Bowl in 1991 has become one of the most famous of all time. On January 27, 1991 Whitney Houston took to the stage in Tampa, Florida and backed by a full orchestra, sang a version of 'The Star Spangled Banner' that has gone down in history. 
Thirty years ago at Super Bowl 25 in Tampa, Whitney Houston wowed America with a rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner, accompanied by the Florida  Houston lip synched the pre-recorded performance. 
It was later confirmed by her musical director that Houston was lip-synching to a version of the song she had pre-recorded, ABC News wrote in a story titled “Whitney Houston's Star-Spangled  
While the evidence suggests Whitney Houston’s iconic 1991 Super Bowl national anthem involved some pre-recorded elements, she did sing live over a backing track rather than purely lip syncing. The technical and pressure-filled demands of the performance make the move understandable rather than scandalous. 
Houston would continue to perform “The Star-Spangled Banner” at several other events, following the Super Bowl, including a Welcome Home Heroes special on HBO, recorded in March 1991. 
TIL Whitney Houston Lip Synced her 1991 Superbowl rendition of the U.S. National Anthem. The performance is frequently considered one of the best anthems in history but her microphone was turned off and a pre-recorded version was played. 
There would be none of that with this first Gulf War. Americans went out of their way to embrace the military. This would be the first Super Bowl with massive amounts of security and a harbinger of what would follow after years of terrorists, homegrown like Oklahoma City or by groups like al-Qaida or ISIS wreaking havoc around the world. 
Whitney Houston wasn’t lip-syncing the national anthem at the Super Bowl last Sunday, but the audience was hearing a prerecorded version, said Bob Best, executive producer of the NFL’s pregame  
Editor's note: As Super Bowl LVI approaches, we revisit this story about Whitney Houston's 1991 performance of the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV, which originally posted on Feb. 1, 2016. 
Super Bowl XXV, here in Tampa. Giants beat the Bills when Scott Norwood went wide right. New Kids on the Block were the halftime show, but for the only time in Super Bowl history, it didn't air until after the game on tape delay. Instead, a special report from Peter Jennings on the Gulf War aired. Spoiler alert, we won. 
(To prevent surprises from happening while at the Super Bowl, Houston pre-recorded the anthem in Los Angeles.) In two minutes and 15 seconds, Houston captured the nation with her performance. 
It was later confirmed by her musical director that Houston was lip-synching to a version of the song she had pre-recorded, ABC News wrote in a story titled “Whitney Houston's Star-Spangled  
(NEXSTAR) – Whitney Houston was an inarguably great singer. Her performance of the national anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl was also inarguably great. It’s often cited as the best-ever rendition of the song, not just for her vocals but for the emotion it carried during the Gulf War. </p>
