The New Orleans Saints are still looking for a head coach, and Kellen Moore is the only named candidate who can't be hired yet because the Eagles are playing in the Super Bowl. 
Childress' record as the team's offensive coordinator was 43-21-0, making him the third-most successful offensive coordinator in Philadelphia Eagles history. The team made it to the playoffs three times ( 2002-2004 ) and had a 4-3 record under Coach Childress in playoff games.

Therefore, the Eagles will now have to fill a void at offensive coordinator for the third consecutive offseason.
