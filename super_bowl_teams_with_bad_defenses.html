        <h2><strong>super bowl teams with bad defenses super bowl xvi hat</strong></h2>
        <p>The 5 worst defenses to win a Super Bowl were: 2011 Giants 25th, 2006 Colts 23rd, 2009 Saints 20th, 2007 Giants 17th, and this year’s Chiefs with a rank of 16 were the 5th worst defense to win a Super Bowl. The 5 worst offenses to win a Super bowl were: 2008 Steelers 20th, 2015 Broncos 19th, 2002 Buccaneers 18th, 1990 Giants 15th, 2000 Ravens  
Best Super Bowl Team Defenses – 114 Super Bowl Teams Defensive Rankings Best Super Bowl Team Defenses – 114 Super Bowl Teams Defensive Rankings p2 . Standard Deviation Scale. Here is a simple breakdown for standard deviation units(SDU) Outstanding = 2.00+ Good To Great = 1.01+ thru 2.00. Average to Good = 0.00 thru 1.00. Average to Poor = 0  
The old saw that defense wins championships has held up pretty well over the life of the NFL, and the last four Super Bowl winners have all had terrific defenses that pushed them into the  
The Kansas City Chiefs won in Super Bowl LVIII versus the 49ers on February 11.  TEAM DATE W ROUND TM OPP RESULT TD 1DWN  Worst Record ATS . 2-15. 4-13. 5-12. 5-12. 
Much like their 2007 Super Bowl team, this iteration relied on their defense stepping up when it mattered most. They held Atlanta to just a safety, then stunned the #1 seed and defending champion Packers at Lambeau before squeaking past the 49ers in an upset win. 
The only team to go 15-1 and fail to win a playoff game, these Packers fielded a much better squad in their Super Bowl title defense than the 10-6 team that became champion. 
Athlon Sports' 10 Worst Teams to Play in a Super Bowl 1. 1985 New England Patriots. Super Bowl result: Lost 46-10 to Chicago in Super Bowl XX New England went 11-5 in the regular season to earn a  
The Kansas City Chiefs won in Super Bowl LVIII against the 49ers on February 11.  TEAM DATE W ROUND TM OPP RESULT TD 1DWN  Worst Record ATS . 2-14. 4-12. 5-11  
However, it does seem a team that is exceptional on offense and okay-to-bad on defense is more likely to make the Super Bowl than a team that is exceptional on defense and okay-to-bad on offense  
It looks like both defenses will have the edge in Super Bowl 59, so the end result will likely depend on which team can gets its offensive stars to perform at the highest level. 
It wasn’t unexpected, he was obviously the worst QB to ever win a Super Bowl but frankly one of the worst QBs ever. I know Dilfer talks a big game about how he played on America’s Game or that 30-30 but watch him play, he was dogshit. 
On Sunday, the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will meet for Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas. These are two of the NFL's best teams. The 49ers were the No. 1 seed in the NFC, while the  
The then-losingest team in history to make a Super Bowl, with no notable players beyond JPP and Manning, beat the “unstoppable” Patriots in the most-watched event  
They played better, sure. That's true about every team that's won the Super Bowl. There's a big difference between playing better and adding two of your three best players to the lineup, though. The 2006 Colts defense didn't just play well in the postseason; they carried the team. Manning had a 70.5 passer rating and 7 INTs vs. 3 TDs. 
Before 2006 the only team to win a Superbowl with a CRA below 10 were the 1968 Jets The Mannings have never won a Superbowl on a team with a CRA above 12.5 Eli Manning is the only QB to ever win a Superbowl with a CRA above 15 and he has done it twice! In 2008 the number 1 defense and the number 20 offense Steelers won the Superbowl. 
The largest difference was both 2017 and 2018, in which the Super Bowl Winner's defense was 22nd places higher than the MVP Best defense to win the Super Bowl; tied 2013 Broncos/2015 Panthers. Worst defense to win the Super Bowl; 2011 Giants (Only team with a defensive EPA/Play ranked in the bottom half of the league). 
Ehhhh that’s not really true. Patriots were a somewhat weak team because of their defense (30th ranked by DVOA) which at the time was the worst defense to ever make the Super Bowl before they were “beaten” by the 2017 Pats. However, the 2011 Pats were still 4th overall in team DVOA solely on the strength of their offense. 
-So since 2000, only 8 teams have won a ring without a top 10 defense in points per drive during the regular season, led by 6 different Quarterbacks. -These are the worst regular season defenses to achieve Super Bowl victory , their Quarterbacks, and their respective defensive performances in the playoffs. 
5. 1966 Packers . Vince Lombardi's 1966 defense is a major reason why the Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. The '66 Packers defense, a unit that allowed just 11.6 points per game during the  
The 2006 Colts were the worst Super Bowl winners in terms of rushing defense, giving up 173 YPG. The Chiefs aren’t near that mark, allowing 117.5. Also, was there anything that changed late in the season for those Colts that gave their defense a huge improvement and essentially won the Super Bowl for them that year? I wonder. </p>
