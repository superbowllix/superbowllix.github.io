        <h2><strong>eagles super bowl winning qbs super bowl time dubai</strong></h2>
        <p>Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Philadelphia's first Super Bowl appearance was a 27-10 loss to the then-Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 15. Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett threw for three touchdowns while Eagles signal-caller Ron  
Won Super Bowl 41-33 vs. New England Patriots. Offensive Coordinator: Frank Reich. Defensive Coordinator: Jim Schwartz. Other Notable Asst.: John DeFilippo (Quarterbacks), Ken Flajole (Linebackers), Mike Groh (Wide Receivers), Press Taylor (Off. Quality Control/Asst. Quarterbacks) and Cory Undlin (Defensive Backs) Stadium: Lincoln Financial Field 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33  Philadelphia had overcome a late-season ACL tear by QB Carson Wentz and  
Super Bowl 52 (2017 season): 41-33 win over New England Patriots Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 loss to Kansas City Chiefs Philadelphia Eagles running back has dominated the run game every  
Entering Super Bowl 59 this year, Philadelphia has been to four NFL title games and holds a 1-3 record in Super Bowl matchups. The Eagles lost in each of their first two Super Bowl appearances. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have been led to the Super Bowl by Jalen Hurts. Every QB the Eagles have had has not been as successful as their current one. A look at the quarterbacks who started the most games each season for Philly since the Super Bowl began. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain. The Eagles cut to other stars from that game in attendance on the big screen and now — two years after Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl — the franchise has a chance at winning their second one. 
The Eagles defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII, and Philly's quarterback Nick Foles was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award. Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl win years: What years did  
Carson Wentz once again will mostly be a spectator on the sidelines during a Super Bowl appearance by the Philadelphia Eagles. Seven years after he watched his backup Nick Foles win the MVP after delivering the Eagles their first Super Bowl title, Wentz is back on the big stage as a backup to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes as the Chiefs prepare to take on his former team and his former backup  
His 119.2 passer rating from 2013 is 4 th-highest in NFL history (behind Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and 2020 and Peyton Manning in 2004), his 9.1 yards per attempt is 12 th-highest in history, his 14.2 yards per completion is 6 th-highest in the last 30 years, his touchdown percentage — one TD every 11.7 attempts — is 12 th-highest in NFL history and his interception percentage – one every  
Philadelphia Eagles. 1. LII. 1. Matthew Stafford. Los Angeles Rams. 1. LVI. 0. The list of Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is quite long as 34 different passers have won the big game. Tom Brady  
The first Black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl, he was named the game's MVP and went on to a long career as an NFL coach and executive.  The youngest quarterback in Eagles  
Backup quarterback Nick Foles was named Super Bowl MVP. The Eagles defeated both Super Bowl teams from the previous NFL season (the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons) in the playoffs, the third team to beat both of them this season, after the Carolina Panthers and Miami Dolphins. 
The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will compete in Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, with kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.. There have been a lot of  
The last 19 quarterbacks to make their Super Bowl debut as a starter and lose, never returned to the championship game -- until Hurts snapped the streak with the Eagles win over the Commanders on  
Quarterback jersey numbers without a Super Bowl win. This is where Hurts’ number comes into play. Of the 19 available jersey numbers for quarterbacks, only four have yet to be worn by the winning QB in the Super Bowl: Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 19. Cam Newton was the most recent No. 1 to step under center in the Super Bowl, but Hurts has a chance to be  
Foles led the Eagles to winning the 2018 Super Bowl after starting QB Carson Wentz suffered a knee injury late in the season.  Nick Foles, Super Bowl-winning QB with Eagles, retires from NFL.
