        <p>Also, an article from January 2021 shows that his demands were so high that even the Super Bowl couldn't afford to book him. I think he lost big opportunities to make history performing at Super Bowl, but after all the backlash from last year, he's forever banned from performing at Super Bowl.

I was two months from going bankrupt, and I put everything I had into it [the album and the Super Bowl advert]," he told TMZ. Although a risky move, the idea seemed to have paid off for the rapper after his album later reached number one in 100 countries, and made Ye $19.3million from the advert.

This is the main reason why I think he'll never get to perform at the Super Bowl. There's no telling what in the world he's going to say. Even with the delay and cutting away, it could ruin the flow of production. It would be a great moment, but a giant headache in for network.

When I saw Kanye perform at Bonnaroo last year, he sang about how 'they'll never let me play at the super bowl, at least not until i'm super old'. Yeah a Kanye super bowl halftime show would be amazing, just imagine what kind of set he could design with that massive budget they'd give him, but I really doubt it will happen. 
Man if they had to have a discusion with Em. for 2 mil Janelle should have got a bit more than 150K, but that's cool it's not like it's the actual Super Bowl. They got a great artist on the come up with Janelle and I'm sure they'll enjoy their little rich people V.I.P. party

It makes me so sad, at his best Kanye was a symbol of hope and the ability to fight mental illness and create meaning. The fact that he has seemingly failed and completely gone off the deep end just takes that away from me - it’s hard to feel inspiration or comfort in his music anymore. </p>
