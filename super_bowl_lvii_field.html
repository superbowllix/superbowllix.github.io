        <p>Photo courtesy of @westwood1sports on Twitter. With just four days until kickoff, the field design for Super Bowl LVII between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles has been revealed. 
The field is readied on February 11, 2023, ahead of Super Bowl LVII between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. 
Super Bowl LVII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2022 season.The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35. 
An NFL logo was painted at midfield with a Super Bowl LVII logo at both 25-yard lines. The league has gone with that layout for each of the last 20 Super Bowls since 2003. That year, the Super Bowl XXXVII logo was painted at the 50-yard line with a helmet for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Oakland Raiders at each 25-yard line. 
Super Bowl LVII marks West Coast Turf’s ninth Super Bowl field since the company’s inception in the 1990s. But for Danek, now a general manager for the company, this is his first. 
The stadium typically keeps the roof closed during early-season football games but will likely have it open during the Super Bowl. High temperatures for Super Bowl LVII will be in the low-70s. The Philadelphia Eagles will take on the Kansas City Chiefs for Super Bowl LVII at 4:30 p.m. MST on FOX. 
For good reason, too. At State Farm Stadium, the field measures 234 feet wide and 403 feet long. And with it being a natural-grass playing field, more paint is required due to watering and mowing than on an artificial turf field. Johnson estimates that three pallets with 24 five-gallon buckets of paint will be used for the Super Bowl.

Nick Pappas, field director for the NFL discusses the field preparation for Super Bowl LVIII. The all-new natural grass surface installed on a retractable tray outside the stadium was prepared and tested leading up to the game, which occurred on February 11, 2024 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. “We have brought in a brand-new grass field. 
All that said, the field design for LIX – which kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET on FOX – is nearly identical to LVII, aside from the updated Super Bowl logo at the 25-yard lines and the fact that
