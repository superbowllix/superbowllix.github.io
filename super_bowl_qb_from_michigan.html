        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
As the 55th edition of the Super Bowl is set to take place on Sunday, there have been 69 former Michigan football players who have been on the roster or have coached for the big game throughout history. Some of them were active players, some were on the practice squad, some were on injured reserve and others coached in the game. 
Using Pro Football Reference's database of quarterbacks, we sorted through the 721 quarterbacks who made their debuts during the Super Bowl era (since 1966). We assigned where a quarterback "came

This is a list of Michigan Wolverines football players who have attained notability through their performance in the sport of American football and other endeavors. The list includes over 750 players, including more than 50 All-Americans, three Heisman Trophy winners (Tom Harmon, Desmond Howard and Charles Woodson), six U.S. Congressmen, and a President of the United States (Gerald Ford). 
With his unparalleled arm strength and unwavering competitiveness, Brady led the Wolverines to an Orange Bowl victory in 2000, throwing for a then-record 369 yards. His leadership and poise under pressure became the cornerstone of his illustrious NFL career, as this Michigan product went on to become a seven-time Super Bowl champion. 
Category II: Most Super Bowl games started by a quarterback who was an alumnus of a given school. Michigan – 10 (Tom Brady 10) Stanford – 7 (John Elway 5, Jim Plunkett 2) 
However, when discussing Super Bowl quarterbacks, one name stands above the rest—Tom Brady. The University of Michigan standout has started in a record 10 Super Bowls, winning seven. Brady, drafted in the sixth round by the New England Patriots, defied expectations and became the most successful quarterback in Super Bowl history.

Philly QB Jalen Hurts is chief among them, although he did spend three seasons at Alabama before transferring to Oklahoma for his final season in 2019 when he finished second in Heisman Trophy  
Conversely, had Ford taken the Packers up on their offer, he almost surely would have won multiple NFL championships, as they won several times during the years he would have played, and he'd been a star lineman at Michigan so it's hard to imagine him dragging them down. Not a Super Bowl per se, but the nearest thing. 
The other four that featured starting signal callers from the same state were Super Bowl XIX (Joe Montana/Dan Marino), Super Bowl XXV (Jeff Hostetler/Jim Kelly), Super Bowl LIII (Tom Brady/Jared Goff) and Super Bowl LVII (Patrick Mahomes/Jalen Hurts). 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Carson Wentz arrives at New Orleans international airport, Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025, in Kenner, La. ahead of the NFL Super Bowl 59 football game between the Philadelphia  
In Week 11, he led the 49ers to an upset victory over the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys, 38–20, throwing for two touchdowns and running for a third. [11] Grbac ended the season with a QB rating of 96.6, 183 passes attempted and 127 completed, eight passing touchdowns and two rushing, for a total of 1,469 yards gained. 
Michigan football's backslide from winning the national championship last season to clawing to just get bowl eligible in 2024 is due to a variety of reasons, but the team's quarterback situation  
The Lions won three pre-Super Bowl NFL titles in the 1950s with Hall of Fame QB Bobby Layne under center, the last in 1957. They haven't been to a title game since and some blame Layne for cursing the team when he was traded from the team in 1958. 
Super Bowl 59 is set with the Eagles ready to face the Chiefs in a rematch of Super Bowl 57.  1982, at Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. Score: 49ers 26, Bengals 21. Super Bowl MVP: Joe  
Super Bowl wins: 7. Michigan runs away with the title in this category thanks to the historic work of one man: Tom Brady, who led the Patriots to six Super Bowl championships and the Buccaneers to  
Renewed focus under Sherrone Moore and some help from Michigan alum Tom Brady helped lure star QB prospect Bryce Underwood to Ann Arbor, according to Bruce Feldman. </p>
