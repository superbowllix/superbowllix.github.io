        <h2><strong>super bowl ads women super bowl viewership right now</strong></h2>
        <p>The Ad Meter summit, a preview of Super Bowl commercials, was held in New Orleans. Speakers from major brands discussed topics like women in sports and the use of celebrities in advertising. Newcomers to the Super Bowl ad scene, Instacart and Häagen-Dazs, debuted their commercials. 
Super Bowl LIX featuring more health, women’s focused ads 02.05.2025 A “slew of advertisers are bringing a healthier and more woman-focused message” to this year’s Super Bowl, with spots highlighting “everything from breast cancer awareness to obesity and body positivity,” according to Fischer &amp; Flynn of AXIOS. 
Brands tend to take a wide swing to reach the widest possible audience, but they will be looking at the content of their ads to avoid turning off women, she said. Humor is a reliable go-to in Super Bowl ads, and Zielinski noted Ipsos research found women also respond to humor, but humorous ads tend to score lower on gender equality measures. 
Keller: Super Bowl ads will target women more than ever in 2025 03:05. The opinions expressed below are Jon Keller's, not those of WBZ, CBS News or Paramount Global. 
Why it matters: The trend is a shift from the last few years when the Super Bowl was flooded with ads that typically target young men and their vices, like sports betting and crypto investing. Zoom in: Novartis will mark its Super Bowl debut with a 60-second, star-studded commercial spotlighting breast cancer awareness. 
Hailee Steinfeld and Wanda Sykes are partnering with Novartis to encourage women to understand their breast cancer risk and get early screenings in a new ad that will air during the Super Bowl on  
For e.l.f., the 2024 Super Bowl spot will mark their first national Super Bowl ad, while Dove is returning to the advertising line-up for the first time in nearly two decades. This change in  
In a bigger shift, several longtime Super Bowl advertisers, like M&amp;M’S, have spots featuring women who, for a change, aren’t just sipping soda in tight pants. Blame — or credit — singer  
This year's Super Bowl ads featured women front and center. Getty Images. I have been writing about women as NFL fans for years. This year’s crop of Super Bowl ads felt like a giant leap forward  
The conventional wisdom for decades has been that the huge Super Bowl audience is overwhelmingly male, and so men were by default the demographic targeted in ads. Women were generally an afterthought. But this year, a large percentage of the ads are aimed at women, and there seem to be more women present as celebrity product pushers, too. 
No list of deplorable depictions of women would be complete without Carl's Jr. While Carl's Jr. has technically never run a national Super Bowl ad, it got plenty of backlash for its 2015 local  
WeatherTech has released a high-energy tease for its upcoming Super Bowl 2025 commercial, spotlighting four fun-loving women cruising around in a 1963 Lincoln Continental convertible—proving that good times (and top-tier automotive protection) aren’t limited by age. Produced by long-time agency partner Pinnacle Advertising, the “Born to  
When it comes to the Super Bowl, the nation is divided—and we don’t mean by team. Instead of Eagles vs. Chiefs, the real divide is between those who watch for the game and those who watch for the commercials. The 2025 Super Bowl is delivering hilarious ads featuring beloved stars—and the best may be yet [] 
Women watch the Super Bowl, too, right? And this year a slew of advertisers is expecting it. Health and beauty companies, some for the first time, are joining the scrum of beverage, technology and  
Some other firsts can be seen across the emerging commercial topics. For one thing, more spots will cater to women. Viewers can also expect a bigger presence from artificial intelligence and pharmaceutical brands, but fewer movie trailers, with a preference toward the longer, 60-second commercials, as Fox Sports’ Head of Sales Mark Evans told Ad Age. 
In last year’s Super Bowl LI, more than 2.5 as many leading ad roles went to men than to women, 61 for men compared with 23 for women, according to the Ad Age Super Bowl Archive, which excludes movie trailers and TV promos. 
This year's Super Bowl commercials feature strong women -- the ultimate rarity in advertising. By Samantha Cooney on February 7, 2016
