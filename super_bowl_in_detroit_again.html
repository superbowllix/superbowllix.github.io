        <p>In just a few days, the 59th Super Bowl will take place, and for the 59th consecutive time, it will not feature the Detroit Lions. This year, it felt like the Lions may finally break the streak  
Detroit has held the Super Bowl twice, once at the Pontiac Silverdome (1982), and once at Ford Field (2006). The Motor City hasn't held a Super Bowl in nearly two decades, so it seems as though it  
Super Bowl XL was in 2006, a monumental time for your author as a young Pittsburgh Steelers fan wearing his Jerome Bettis jersey. The Big Game hasn't come back to Detroit since, and it's time we collectively accept that it never will, so long as Ford Field is the Lions' home. 
Detroit has watched two of its best seasons in team history close in heartbreaking defeats in consecutive years.  These Lions will enter next season as one of the Super Bowl favorites again  
2028: Ford Field, Detroit Lions. Ford Field opened in 2002 and hosted a Super Bowl in 2006. The Detroit area has done a lot to improve itself over the past decade and Ford Field is a beautiful venue. 
Super Bowl Locations and Dates. Super Bowl LIX: Feb. 9, 2025 - Caesars Superdome (New Orleans, LA), home of the New Orleans Saints; Super Bowl LX: Feb. 8, 2026 - Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, CA  
Ford Field has turned into one of, if not the NFL's most electric environments. The Lions won two home playoff games last year, and if they do that again they'll be playing for a Super Bowl. 
It is the 16th different host city for the Super Bowl.  Location: Detroit. Result: Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Seattle Seahawks 10. Super Bowl 39 (Feb. 6, 2005) Venue: Alltel Stadium. 
The Detroit Lions fell short of their lofty Super Bowl-or-bust expectations in 2024. In case you've been living under a rock, they suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Washington  
Dan Campbell's Detroit Lions have been the NFL's best regular-season team over the last two years. After two brutal playoff losses, that means very little. “I told those guys, this may have been  
Detroit shone in the spotlight on Feb. 5, 2006 as the city played host to Super Bowl XL at Ford Field. Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Hines Ward was walking on air after his 43-yard touchdown catch  
The Detroit Lions are once again the favorites to win Super Bowl 59. After a dominant, exclamation point win over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18, the Lions are the favorite to win the Super Bowl at +280, according to BetMGM, meaning a $10 bet would net you $28 profit, plus your $10 back. 
The Detroit Lions are Super Bowl favorites again after a dominant performance against the Vikings, according to the latest Super Bowl odds. By Jeremy Reisman @DetroitOnLion Jan 6, 2025, 8:45am EST 
NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XL to Detroit during their November 1, 2000, meeting held in Atlanta. It marked the second Super Bowl held in the Detroit area, the first was XVI played at the Pontiac Silverdome in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac. [7] [8] Three Super Bowls host sites were selected during the meeting, XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XL  
MIDLAND, Mich. – Jamie Gregory, a devoted Detroit Lions fan from Midland, had a dream shared by many: to see the Lions play in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, that dream didn’t come true. 
Myles Garrett is on radio row at Super Bowl 2025 in New Orleans, after his trade request from Cleveland Browns. We asked him about Detroit Lions. 
The Detroit Lions' playoff run came to a heartbreaking end in the Divisional Round against the Washington Commanders. However, a recent admission by the NFL has reignited frustration for Lions fans, as it has been revealed that a missed penalty may have been a key turning point in the game that ultimately led to their loss. 
The team and city have officially bid for both the 2020 and 2021 draft, and the Super Bowls have been awarded out through 2022. That means the earliest Detroit could host again would be 2023, 17 years after XL. That would be a faster turnaround than the 24 years between Super Bowl XVI at the Pontiac Silverdome and XL. 
2028: Ford Field, Detroit Lions. Ford Field opened in 2002 and hosted a Super Bowl in 2006. The Detroit area has done a lot to improve itself over the past decade and Ford Field is a beautiful venue. 
NEW ORLEANS — Dominic Raiola never made a Super Bowl in his 14 NFL seasons, but the former longtime Detroit Lions center deserves an assist if the Philadelphia Eagles win one this week.. Eagles  </p>
