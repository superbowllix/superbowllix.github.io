        <h2><strong>2 time super bowl champion qbs 49ers vs chiefs super bowl history results</strong></h2>
        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
The Super Bowl 59 showdown will be a rematch of Super Bowl 57 where Kansas City defeated Philadelphia. That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. 
Dawson, who won MVP honors in Kansas City's win over Minnesota in Super Bowl IV, was a three-time AFL champion and a seven-time Pro Bowler. Both quarterbacks are members of the Hall of Fame. 
As the Super Bowl matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles approaches, here's a look at the 12 quarterbacks in NFL history who have won multiple Super Bowls. 
Patrick Mahomes won his 3rd Super Bowl championship ring in 2024 with a 25-22 win over the San Francisco 49ers. Where does he stand in the all-time ranking 
Tom Brady’s seven Super Bowl wins are the most among any quarterbacks — and all players — in NFL history. Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana are both tied for second all-time among starting quarterbacks with four Super Bowl victories. With Brady’s retirement, Patrick Mahomes is the active leader for most Super Bowls among quarterbacks. 
He won Super Bowl XXVII MVP honors and was the first quarterback to win three Super Bowls over a four-year span. He won 90 regular season games during the '90s and went 11-4 in playoff games. 10. 
Bradshaw threw for 300-plus yards in half his Super Bowls which, in the 1970s, was the quarterback equivalent of going to the moon (Super Bowl XII, in 1978, featured 217 total net passing yards). 
Legacy of Multiple Super Bowl-Winning Quarterbacks. The elite fraternity of quarterbacks with multiple Super Bowl victories exemplifies excellence, leadership, and the ability to perform under pressure on football’s grandest stage. Their achievements continue to inspire generations of fans, shaping the narrative of NFL greatness. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.

Bob Griese has an impressive resume: Two-time Super Bowl champion, two-time All-Pro, and eight-time Pro Bowler. Despite a challenging start with a 10-20-2 record in his initial 32 starts and two Pro Bowl appearances in the first three seasons, Griese underwent a remarkable transformation over the next five years.
