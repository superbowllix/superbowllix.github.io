How many times has New Orleans hosted the Super Bowl? New Orleans will host its 11th Super Bowl this year, tying Miami for the most ever. Los Angeles is in third with eight games. 
SB 44: New Orleans 31, Indianapolis 17 (Sun Life Stadium, Miami Gardens) SB 54: Kansas City 31, San Francisco 20 (Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens) Super Bowls in Los Angeles (8) 
Miss Louisiana 1996 Erika Schwarz Wright performed sign language alongside the national anthem performed by Luther Vandross. And, for the coin toss, the winning head coaches of the previous six New Orleans Super Bowls were featured. New Orleans had cemented itself as a staple of the Super Bowl. Super Bowl XXXVI: February 3, 2002 
The next time the Super Bowl (XXXVI) returned to New Orleans on February 3, 2002, the New England Patriots walked away the winners against the St. Louis Rams, and it was by a thin margin of 20-17. This was the first Super Bowl played after the September 11, 2001 attack. 
Super Bowl LIX will take place next month in the Superdome. The venue has hosted many NFL championships, as New Orleans has been a great backdrop. Which games have taken place in New Orleans and what other venue hosted the Super Bowl? Let’s take a look  
Jan. 11, 1970, Tulane Stadium: Kansas City 23, Minnesota 7. 1. New Orleans was supposed to get Super Bowl III, in which the New York Jets upset the Baltimore Colts, in part as a thank you to two  
New Orleans hosted its first Super Bowl on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in front of a crowd of nearly 81,000. Led by Head Coach Hank Stram, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in the last-ever championship between the NFL and AFL before the two leagues merged. 
The Chiefs have a 4-2 record all-time at the Caesars Superdome. The Eagles have a 9-8 record all-time at the Superdome. Super Bowl LIX will be Kansas City's first playoff game at the Superdome. 
New Orleans is tied with Miami for most Super Bowls held with 10 apiece. Most of this goes back to the early days before northern cities built domed stadiums and the Super Bowl required a 
Prices on the secondary-ticket market for Sunday’s Super Bowl in New Orleans are much less than last year’s big game and declining, but still high by historical standards. The average price for the Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles game at TickPick was $6,552 as of Tuesday. If that amount  
On Aug. 3, 1975, the Louisiana Superdome opened to the public after nine years of development, delays, anticipation, and controversy. Enormous and eye-catching, it stood as the largest indoor arena 
Super Bowl VI provided a tribute to New Orleans jazz musician Louis Armstrong with performances by Ella Fitzgerald, Carol Channing, Al Hirt, and the U.S. Marine Corps Drill Team. Super Bowl XV’s show was Mardi Gras festival. Super Bowl LVIII will be New Orleans’ 11th Super Bowl and the Superdome’s 8th. 
Jay Cicero, Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation president and Super Bowl LIX Host Committee member, pointed to a UNO study that found the 2013 Super Bowl had a $480 million economic impact on the city. A projection for this year’s game hasn’t yet been calculated, but Cicero said local nonprofits are already seeing benefits. 
This year, Super Bowl LIX will be held at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. It has been 12 years since the city hosted the game, and it will be the 11th Super Bowl played in New Orleans. 
This 11th Super Bowl in New Orleans, much like that first Super Bowl in 1970 or the 1984 World’s Fair, brings a sense of pride and a “we can do it” vibe to our community and state. 
NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA - JANUARY 2, 2025: Samantha Petry weeps as Bourbon Street is reopened after being closed off since a man drove a pickup truck into a crowd of people early on New Years Day  
Celebrating 26 years during Super Bowl LIX, this year’s event is themed “Keep Going” and will take place on Feb. 5, 2025, at New Orleans’ historic Mahalia Jackson Theater of Performing Arts. Featuring performances from diverse genres such as R&amp;B, Gospel and Country, past artists include Kirk Franklin, Patti LaBelle, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire
