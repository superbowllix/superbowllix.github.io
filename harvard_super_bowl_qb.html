        <h2><strong>harvard super bowl qb super bowl winner this year</strong></h2>
        <p>This is a list of National Football League (NFL) quarterbacks who have started in the Super Bowl. Hall of Famers Bart Starr (top) and Len Dawson (bottom) started in the first Super Bowl for the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs respectively. 
History will be made on Sunday, when the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers square off in Las Vegas, as two Harvard football alums will meet in the Super Bowl for the first time in 
Just eight Black quarterbacks have started in a Super Bowl, beginning with Washington's Doug Williams, who not only captured the Lombardi Trophy but also Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 320  
Super Bowl LVII also marked the first time that both Super Bowl starting quarterbacks were black: Patrick Mahomes started for the Kansas City Chiefs, while Jalen Hurts started for the Philadelphia Eagles. 
And his veteran-level poise was even more apparent in 2013, when he guided a 13-3 finish and became the third-youngest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl, controlling the ball as the Seahawks  
Harvard Players/Alumni 
Although seven previous Crimson players — including Juszczyk, whose 49ers lost to the Chiefs, 31-20, four years ago — have appeared in the league’s ultimate contest, next Sunday will mark the first 
The first Black QB to win the Super Bowl as a starter, Williams and his teammates overcame a slow start to record the greatest quarter a team has ever put together in a playoff game, let alone a

Truman Jones (left) and Kyle Juszczyk will face off Sunday at Super Bowl LVIII. This Sunday’s Super Bowl LVIII will be a win-win for Harvard football fans, regardless of the outcome. For the first time ever, an alum will be on both sides of the field. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Carson Wentz, QB - (North Dakota State) Longtime NFL journeyman and ex-NDSU star Carson Wentz has found his way back to the super bowl, this time for Kansas City. Wentz, the former Philadelphia starter, has seen time in five different cities, mainly as a backup, before landing with the Chiefs. 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
Brunell was a three-time Pro Bowl selection with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He has also played for the Washington Redskins, New Orleans Saints, and New York Jets. In 2009, he earned a Super Bowl ring as the backup quarterback and holder for the Saints' Super Bowl XLIV winning team against the Indianapolis Colts. 
Under McVay, Jared Goff turned into a Pro Bowl caliber QB, reaching the 2018 Super Bowl, which he lost in a defensive (snoozefest) battle to the New England Patriots, 13-3. 
Brate admired both men while in College, following the Patriots’ four division, two conference, and one Super Bowl championship during his Harvard time. He replaced the Gronkowski jersey he used to wear with an official shirt signed by the man himself, and he made sure to hang onto the ball Brady threw him for the go-ahead touchdown during  
Fittingly, the most recent time a quarterback caught a pass in the Super Bowl also included this year’s NFC champions, the Philadelphia Eagles. In Super Bowl LII, Foles scored a legendary fourth-down touchdown in the waning moments of the first half to put Philadelphia ahead by 10 points in a game it would go on to win by eight. 
Only five colleges have produced a US President and a Super Bowl winning quarterback Trivia • Ben Roethlisberger (XL, XLIII) and Benjamin Harrison (1889-1893) both attended Miami of Ohio University. 
Joe Theismann is the only other former Notre Dame quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl, leading the Washington Redskins to a 27-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the 17th big game. 
Though the goal for any team is to win the Super Bowl and hoist the Lombardi Trophy, the Seattle Seahawks were playing for individual hardware too in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers  </p>
