        <p>On top of the 33 quarterbacks to win Super Bowl MVP, eight wide receivers and seven running backs have won the award. Defensively, only 10 players have won the award and one special teams ace has  
Bart Starr was the MVP of Super Bowls I and II while quarterback for the Green Bay Packers Joe Montana won three Super Bowl MVP awards as quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers Jerry Rice, the MVP of Super Bowl XXIII, played wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers Desmond Howard, MVP of Super Bowl XXXI with the Green Bay Packers, is the only special teams player – a kick/punt returner  
How many Super Bowl MVPs have come from the losing team? Dallas Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley was named MVP of Super Bowl V after falling to the Baltimore Colts 16-13 on a late field goal. Howley recorded two interceptions and one fumble recovery to become the first defensive player to win Super Bowl MVP and the first and only player from the  
It’s significant to remember that winning the Super Bowl MVP doesn’t necessarily equate to being the best player in the league that year. Many NFL MVPs have never won a Super Bowl, and  
An MVP has been honored for every Super Bowl, but the trophy, which is named after longtime NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, was first given out at Super Bowl 25. And one player in this year’s Big  
At Super Bowl XXV, the league first awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, named after former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, to the Super Bowl MVP. Ottis Anderson was the first to win the trophy. Tom Brady retired with the most Super Bowl wins (seven), MVPs (five), and appearances (10) in NFL history. The Super Bowl MVP has been awarded annually  
Four running backs were named Super Bowl MVP in the game’s first 18 years, but only three have been picked in the past 36. Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos is the most recent running back to  
The Buffalo Bills and the Baltimore Ravens could not reach the Super Bowl, but instead left their 'representatives' who are serious contenders to lift the MVP trophy, and who in all honesty, have  
Patrick Mahomes won not only his second Super Bowl but also his second Super Bowl MVP on Sunday. However, he wasn’t the best player on the field, which begs the question: Why does the MVP have  
Votes are cast immediately after the fulltime whistle and the winner must come from the victorious team. As such the Super Bowl MVP tends to be awarded to the winning side’s quarterback, as has  
Fans and the media vote on the Super Bowl MVP, though they don’t have an equal say. The NFL handpicks 16 media members covering the game to cast an MVP ballot and that select group accounts for  
Pro Bowl History; AP MVP; AP AFL Player of the Year; UPI MVP; UPI AFL Player of the Year; PFWA MVP; Newspaper Ent. Assoc. MVP; Sporting News Player of the Year; Joe F. Carr Trophy (MVP) Bert Bell Award (Player of the Year) AAFC MVP; Super Bowl MVP; Walter Payton Man of the Year; NFLPA Alan Page Community Award; AP Offensive Player of the Year  
Wide receivers have recently made more noise on the Super Bowl MVP front, winning five times since 2005. That makes sense, as the league has turned more pass-centric in the last two decades. For comparison, a running back has not won the award since Terrell Davis in 1998, and only two defenders claimed MVP since 2005 – both were linebackers. 
How Many NFL Teams Have Ever Won a Super Bowl? If you include the teams that have moved to other cities, 20 total NFL franchises have won a Super Bowl. In a league of 32 teams, 12 have never won in a Super Bowl. Eight NFL teams have appeared in the Super Bowl at some point but have never won one, and four teams have never been there. 
As an example if Hurts got MVP, in one AFL Grand Final (the AFL's Super Bowl) in the 2000s, a player on the losing team was awarded the Norm Smith medal for best on ground (the Super MVP equivalent). Although technically the best individual performance that day, no one was left happy with that decision, the winner of the medal included. 
The Kansas City Chiefs have a shot to be the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in a row,  But Brady played 23 seasons, winning his last Super Bowl MVP award at the age of 43  
Patrick Mahomes was by far the most common selection to win Super Bowl MVP, finishing with 37 of the 67 votes (55.2%). He earned the MVP award in all three of his previous championships with  
Their first championship was a 39-20 drubbing of the Broncos on Jan. 25, 1987, with Phil Simms winning the Super Bowl MVP award. The Giants' most recent Super Bowl wins were in 2008 and 2012, when  
Tyler Forness: (Editor's note: Forness picked the Chiefs to win in our predictions post) The Super Bowl MVP has gone to a player on the winning team in every instance but one: Super Bowl V when
