Rihanna's Super Bowl halftime show was a lot of things, obviously. Her first public show in seven years. The most-watched pregnancy announcement in world history. 
The Meaning Behind The Song: Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show by Rihanna. I have always been a big fan of Rihanna’s music, and her performance at the Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show was no exception. The energy and excitement that filled the stadium that night were unparalleled, and it was truly a moment to remember. 
Once one of the most prolific working hitmakers, Rihanna put her music career mostly on mute after 2016’s Anti, and nothing about this Super Bowl suggests she’s hurrying into a new chapter  
All told, the performance required the participation of some 800 people, from camera operators to stage crews to Rihanna and her 80 dancers and seven band members. It also required a great deal of

Rihanna’s being praised because she stayed fully clothed during her Super Bowl performance, and yes, we are still being this condescending to women in 2023.

Nothing except Rihanna being a boss and a half on her flying stage, reigning supreme at her Super Bowl halftime show and crushing every possible prediction about how she would handle her first  
Music. Everything we know about Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime performance After five years since her last live performance, Rihanna is headlining the 2023 Super Bowl halftime show 
Rihanna’s Super Bowl half time performance was red hot. Seriously. The singer floated above State Farm Stadium—singing live for the first time in five years—in an all red look contrasted by  
Rihanna appeared to pay tribute to a late fashion icon during her outstanding Super Bowl halftime show performance. The pop icon appeared on a levitating stage at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona on Sunday.
