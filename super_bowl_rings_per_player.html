        <p>13 players have won 5 championships counting the pre-Super Bowl era; with the exception of Charles Haley, all were from the 1960s Packers. Bart Starr (quarterback) won the NFL championships with the Green Bay Packers in 1961, 1962 and 1965, Super Bowls I and II with the Packers after the 1966 and 1967 seasons, respectively.

Tom Brady sits at the top of Super Bowl champions with an astonishing 7 rings. Brady won three titles in his first four years as a starter in 2001, 2003, and 2004 with the Patriots. Then, Brady lost two Super Bowls in 2007 and 2011 before finally winning his fourth in 2014. 
The Hall of Famer was part of 5 Super Bowl wins in a span of 8 years. This includes winning three out of four years in the early 90s with the Dallas Cowboys. Joey Thuney joined the list after the 2023 season when the Chiefs won Super Bowl LVIII. That gives Thuney four Super Bowl rings (2 with Chiefs, 2 with Patriots). 
Here is a look at the players with the most Super Bowl rings. Player: Number of Super Bowl Rings: Tom Brady- QB: 7: Charles Haley- LB : 5: Ted Hendricks- LB: 4: Marv Fleming- TE: 4: Matt Millen  
In addition, there are 22 players (including QB Terry Bradshaw and RB Franco Harris) who were part of all four Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl wins after the 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons. 
Hostetler did not play in the 1987 Super Bowl, but was the Giants' third-string quarterback.) Mark Rypien — 2 (1988 and 1992 with Washington. Rypien did not play in the 1988 Super Bowl but  
In fact, Fleming and 32 other players are tied for third place on the list at four Super Bowl rings apiece. Ted Hendricks, Matt Millen, Bill Romanowski, and legendary kicker Adam Vinatieri are also among the tied players with four rings apiece, while 22 players won four championships with the Pittsburgh Steelers and six others won a quartet of  
7 players are tied for the most career wins by an active player in Super Bowls, with 3 wins. The first three are Travis Kelce, James Winchester and Chris Jones. 
Chiefs players reportedly paid $11,000 for their 2023 Super Bowl rings, which was deducted from their paychecks—a minor concession considering each player on the winning team received a $157,000  
The rings can also be characterised with a specific player's name and jersey number. How much does a Super Bowl ring cost to make? The NFL contributes approximately $5,000 to $7,000 per ring for  
The NFL typically contributes anywhere from $5,000 to $7,000 per ring for up to 150 rings per team,  While Brady’s seven rings -- the most of any player in Super Bowl history -- are nothing

The financial investment in these rings is significant, with the NFL contributing between $5,000 and $7,000 per ring for up to 150 rings per team.
