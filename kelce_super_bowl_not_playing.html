Kylie Kelce revealed on the 'Not Gonna Lie' podcast whether she thought her husband Jason Kelce would go shirtless for the 2025 Super Bowl. 
The Chiefs returned to the Super Bowl the following season to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where Kelce delivered what was arguably his most productive Super Bowl performance. He caught 10 passes for 133 yards, converting six first downs while generating three explosive plays and averaging 2.61 yards per route run. 
Travis Kelce says he plans to keep playing after Super Bowl “I’ve got full heart of football left in me. Wanting to keep the legacy &amp; new ways to create memories will fuel me in my love for
