        <p>2023 CFP National Championship: TCU vs. Georgia The most-viewed edition was the one in 2015. Around 33.9 million people tuned in to watch the Ohio State Buckeyes defeat the Oregon Ducks that year. 
The 2025 viewership numbers most closely align with those of 2023, with Conference Championships drawing about 1.3% more viewers, Divisional Round viewership up 0.8%, and Wild Card \viewership  
College Football Playoff ratings information includes streaming viewership where available. Since the start of the BCS in 1999, no game has had a higher rating (21.7) or more viewers (35.6M) than the 2006 Rose Bowl between Texas and USC. Second on that list is the first national championship of the CFP era, Ohio State-Oregon in 2015 (18.6, 34.1M). 
Despite both being incredibly popular, the NFL consistently leads in television ratings and overall viewership, demonstrating its strength in capturing the national audience. The NCAA has a rich tradition and a unique charm that often attracts dedicated support during big games, particularly during bowl season. However, the NFL’s structure  
The Super Bowl is a prime example, drawing massive national attention and generating high viewership. Events like this unify fans across the country, defining national camaraderie. Teams like the New England Patriots and their successful history further fuel enthusiasm. Thus, both levels offer different yet significant cultural experiences  
Comparing Super Bowl Ratings to Other Major Championships. League. Event. Teams Participating. Average Viewership (in millions) NFL. Super Bowl. Kansas City Chiefs vs San Francisco 49ers. 123.4. NBA. 
That figure also topped last season’s non-CFP New Year’s Six bowl games, which averaged 8.15 million viewers on ESPN platforms. Last season’s CFP semifinals averaged 23.2 million viewers, also on ESPN platforms. Those games were Michigan-Alabama in the Rose Bowl and Washington-Texas in the Sugar Bowl. NFL Proved to Be Tough Competition  
The 22.1 million viewers who tuned into watch Will Howard, Jeremiah Smith and the Buckeyes end their 10-year national championship drought marked the third-lowest audience of the past 11 CFP title  
The most-watched college football game in U.S. television history is the 2006 Rose Bowl, which was watched on television by 35.6 million viewers. Texas defeated top-ranked USC 41-38 in a thrilling showdown that awarded them the national championship. 
Last year's "Kelce Bowl" matchup between the Eagles and Chiefs was previously the most-watched Super Bowl ever, followed by the New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks game in 2015 (114.4  
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
The World cup vs Super Bowl debate rages on,  World Cup vs Super Bowl Viewership.  Each player on France’s national team was given £265,000 or roughly $346,000 per player. 
The Super Bowl is the championship game of the National Football League (NFL), held annually in the United States. Since its inception in 1967, it has grown to become a global spectacle, attracting millions of viewers both in the U.S. and internationally. 
What Event Gets More Viewers - the Super Bowl of the World Cup? It’s hard to compare viewership between the Super Bowl and the World Cup because the Super Bowl is a single event while the World Cup has dozens of games. However, for the final match of the 2022 World Cup, FIFA reported 1.5 billion viewers. 
T he showdown between Ohio State and Notre Dame for the national championship has proven to be a ratings bonanza, with ESPN drawing massive viewership numbers for the highly anticipated game  
Remove Hurts' bountiful rushing-touchdown total, and it's not hard to see that these two championship-caliber quarterbacks have experienced a similar 2024 campaign. 
Ravens vs. 49ers Super Bowl 47: Revisiting the 'Harbaugh Bowl,' from blackout to Colin Kaepernick-led comeback attempt  Lost to Patriots in AFC Championship Game: 2012: 10-6.625: Super Bowl  
The Kansas City Chiefs' victory over the Buffalo Bills averaged 57.4 million viewers on CBS, making it the most-watched AFC Championship game in National Football League (NFL) history. 
Key Takeaways Esports viewership is growing fast, with 593.2 million viewers in 2019 expected to reach 1.05 billion by 2024. The League of Legends World Championship 2023 had 6.4 million peak viewers, while Super Bowl LVII had 115 million TV viewers plus 21.81 million streaming viewers. 
Super Bowl LIII in 2019 did all right, hauling in 98.5 million total viewers. That was a pretty boring game between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams. </p>
