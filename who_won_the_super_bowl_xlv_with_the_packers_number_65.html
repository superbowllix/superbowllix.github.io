The Packers entered the Super Bowl never having trailed by more than 7 points at any point during the season—a feat that had never been accomplished during a complete season in the Super Bowl era. The last team to complete a season with this distinction was the Detroit Lions in 1962. [25] In the Super Bowl game itself, the Packers never trailed. 
Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker in official marketing; the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were retroactively applied to the first two games. [4] A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. [5]

Here is a look back at the significant numbers in Sunday’s 31-25 victory by the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV. Other than, of course, the final score. Need proof that the NFL is a passing 
The only other NFL team to accomplish the feat is the franchise the Packers will face in Super Bowl XLV, as the 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers won three road games as the No. 6 seed to advance to Super  
The Green Bay Packers finished the season with a 10–6 record and became the first sixth-seeded team in the NFC to compete in the Super Bowl.

The Green Bay Packers have had some incredible moments over time. This includes four Super Bowl titles and numerous other achievements. So let's take a look at some of the more memorable Super Bowl moments for the team. They are one of the oldest NFL teams founded back in 1919 in Wisconsin.

When Aaron Rodgers took over as the Packers’ starting quarterback in 2008, the team entered a new era of success. Rodgers led Green Bay to victory in Super Bowl XLV (2010 season), where the Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25. Rodgers earned Super Bowl MVP honors for his stellar performance, throwing for 304 yards and three touchdowns. 
The Green Bay Packers won their 13th league title in franchise history, putting them far and away ahead of any other team in NFL history. The Chicago Bears are second with nine; in third place lurk the New York Giants. And the Giants had seven NFL championships at the time of Super Bowl XLV; they would try to make it eight in Super Bowl XLVI. </p>
