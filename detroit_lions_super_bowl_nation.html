The Lions led that game 24-7 at the half, but they let it slip away, and Campbell knew exactly how tough it would be to return to a position to even get into a Super Bowl, much less win it. As it  
In just a few days, the 59th Super Bowl will take place, and for the 59th consecutive time, it will not feature the Detroit Lions. This year, it felt like the Lions may finally break the streak  
The Detroit Lions have made significant strides this offseason with their coaching hires, and one of the most important decisions came when they promoted Kelvin Sheppard to defensive coordinator. Now, a Super Bowl-winning coach has weighed in on the move, and his endorsement couldn't be stronger. Steve Spagnuolo's Strong Endorsement
