        <p>Look, I get it; you got all hopped up on the success of your 2013 Super Bowl ad and using an old-timey voice-over to evoke patriotic ‘Murica warm ‘n’ fuzzies. 
According to USA Today’s Super Bowl Ad Meter, the commercial scored 3.30 out of 10 with panelists, the lowest measured that year. The ad flopped on social media too, mustering only a 14 percent  
To mix sports metaphors, Super Bowl ads are often about taking big swings that are as likely to end in a strikeout as a home run. As is often the case, many of the game's most discussed efforts were described by industry experts as both the best and worst of what advertisers had to offer — another test for brands on whether all engagement is  
The Worst Super Bowl Ads of All Time. The Super Bowl has been a powerful platform for advertisers since its launch in 1968. Even in the very first year of the event, companies paid $150,000 for one minute of ad coverage. With 58 years of commercials, there are some memorable Super Bowl ad flops. Let’s look at some of the worst Super Bowl ads  
Since its 2024 Super Bowl ad, the company has consistently lagged the S&amp;P 500 and, worse yet, significantly fallen short of its competitor, H&amp;R Block, which has outperformed the market for most of the year. In 2024, Toyota featured the Tacoma in its Super Bowl ad. The year has not been kind to the automobile industry, whose category stock  
Brands airing Super Bowl ads have a lot riding on their investments – roughly US$7 million for a 30-second spot for the 2025 big game. So there’s a lot of pressure to get things right. 
In one of the game's few winning ads, Dunkin' built on a highlight of last year's Super Bowl and continued its series of ads featuring Ben Affleck. Courtesy of Dunkin' Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday delivered another nail-biter on the field but a lot of head-scratchers on the advertising front — hello, Temu and RFK Jr. — with just a handful of  
In the wild world of Super Bowl ads, where vehicles fly and celebrities appear in often whacky content, the stakes are high and the opinions even higher. The Action Network has tapped into the minds of NFL fans to uncover which ads sparked controversy, which celebs stole the spotlight, and if that 'perfect' commercial actually influenced fans purchasing decisions. 
Super Bowl commercials lure advertisers year after year. Here's why marketing dollars are better spent elsewhere. Super Bowl ads create a moment, but that moment lasts about as long as it takes  
Super Bowl ads this year, which sold out by early November 2023, are dominated by food and beverage brands. These products appeal to a broad target audience. First-time advertisers like Popeyes  
But also, saying they are getting worse kind of laments a time when superbowl ads were amazing. A lot of them weren't. And some of them were great. Happens every year. Plus every now and then we get some really cool highlights (almost everything google doesplus the entire Miller Light 1 second ad I thought was great due to the build). 
Crypto Super Bowl ads have vanished, fake meat is fading, and shopping on Amazon is getting worse Link Copied! CNN's Allison Morrow tells " Nightcap's " Jon Sarlin why you can expect a lot less  
ADWEEK's Super Bowl 59 Ad Tracker monitors all the advertisers in this year's Big Game. ADWEEK; NFL 
A look at the top Super Bowl ads, and those that missed the mark 05:10. As the Kansas City Chiefs took on the San Francisco 49ers in Sunday's Super Bowl thriller, some of the world's top brands  
Compare that $10 billion in potential loss or gain with the $4 million it costs to purchase one 30 second ad in the Super Bowl, keeping mind that if you buy more than one, each successive ad will get progressively cheaper due to the marginal costs of the ads. So with each ad purchased, your average cost comes down. 
Indeed, consumers rewatch Super Bowl ads on YouTube, news outlets discuss Super Bowl ads the next day, and brands post on their social and digital channels. Such reach can be advantageous for a  
It's an inspired giveaway: DoorDash will provide all of the items in every Super Bowl commercial to one lucky winner, including a 2024 BMW All-Electric i5, chicken wings from Popeyes for 150-plus  
Those were Super Bowl commercials. Well, I've got some good news heading into Super Bowl LIX. The fast food restaurant chain is getting back to those ads that brought so many people together. They recruited the talents of Alix Earle, and together they made their Super Bowl commercials great again. 
I guess because TV commercials nowadays have to be super inoffensive, sterile, and feature obligatory REPRESENTATION!!!, so nobody complains and they won't get taken off TV, they always end up looking so cookie-cutter, so in the end the audience can't always tell the products that are advertised from one another. 
Super Bowl ads are subject to the same rules of effectiveness as all ads: People can’t remember the ad without remembering the brand. People can’t describe the ad to a friend without repeating the message it conveyed. SB ads miss #1 because they try to hard to impress, and miss #2 because there wasn’t a clear message in the brief. </p>
