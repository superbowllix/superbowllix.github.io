        <p>The Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41–33 to win their first Super Bowl. [93] Foles completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards, 3 passing touchdowns, and 1 interception, and was named the Most Valuable Player of the game. 
Jalen Hurts (2020–present) Nick Foles (2012–2014, 2017–2018), won Super Bowl LII. These quarterbacks have started at least one game for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. They are listed in order of the date of each player's first start as the quarterback for the Eagles. 
The Eagles have one Super Bowl win in their history, and you might remember it. Super Bowl 52: Eagles 41, Patriots 33  Philadelphia had overcome a late-season ACL tear by QB Carson Wentz and  
The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, who was considering walking away from professional football just last offseason, won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award after leading Philly past the  
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles (9) holds his daughter, Lily James, after winning the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game against the New England Patriots, Sunday, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis. 
Nick Foles completed his fairy-tale season by leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a win in Super Bowl LII and being named the game's MVP. Jeffri Chadiha chronicles an unbelievable run.

The 35-year-old Foles was a third-round pick by the Eagles in 2012 and played five years over two stints in Philadelphia. Foles made the Pro Bowl in 2013 after throwing seven touchdown passes in a  
The Philadelphia Eagles won their first-ever Super Bowl championship Sunday night, beating the New England Patriots, 41-33.  The proud owner of every major postseason record among quarterbacks  
The German shepherd masks were introduced during the 2017 season as a play on the underdog theme the Eagles thrived on along the way to a Super Bowl victory over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. Perhaps no player fit the long-shot mold that season quite like Foles, a backup QB until he took over in Week 14 for injured starter Carson Wentz. 
Led by quarterback Matt Ryan, the Falcons won six of eight games to close the regular season before defeating the Rams in the wild card.  The Eagles entered Super Bowl LII as 5.5-point  
Carson Wentz once again will mostly be a spectator on the sidelines during a Super Bowl appearance by the Philadelphia Eagles. Seven years after he watched his backup Nick Foles win the MVP after delivering the Eagles their first Super Bowl title, Wentz is back on the big stage as a backup to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes as the Chiefs prepare to take on his former team and his former backup  
How Many Super Bowls Have the Eagles Played In? Super Bowl 15 — January 1981; Super Bowl 39 — February 2005; Super Bowl 52 — February 2018; Super Bowl 57 — February 2023; Although the Eagles have appeared in four Super Bowls, they also made several championship appearances in the pre-Super Bowl era.

The Eagles won their first Super Bowl in 2018 over the New England Patriots. It was an improbable victory given the team started their backup quarterback, Nick Foles. Police greased the poles in

The first Black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl, he was named the game's MVP and went on to a long career as an NFL coach and executive.  The youngest quarterback in Eagles  
In the history of the Philadelphia Eagles, the 2017 season stands alone. It’s not hard to understand why. It’s because the Eagles won the one and only Super Bowl in franchise history that year
