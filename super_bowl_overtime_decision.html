        <p>The Chiefs planned on doing that in Super Bowl 58, as Chris Jones explained after Kansas City's win. "We talked through this for two weeks," Jones told The Ringer of the Chiefs' overtime strategy.

LAS VEGAS — The overtime coin flip came up tails, and San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan faced a decision never before made in Super Bowl history.. The NFL’s new playoff rule called for

San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan defended his decision to receive the ball first in overtime following Sunday's 25-22 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII. 
Shanahan’s decision to take the ball to open overtime was 100 percent the correct decision. However, his postgame explanation was flawed and it opened the door for an inordinate amount of second-guessing. The biggest reason why the 49ers made the correct decision to take the ball to open overtime was because of how regulation ended. 
San Francisco 49ers cornerback Darrell Luter Jr. (28) leaves the field after overtime of the NFL Super Bowl 58 football game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024, in Las Vegas. The Chiefs won 25-22. 
The 49ers tested Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes' ability in clutch moments, and it came back to bite them in their gut-wrenching Super Bowl LVIII loss on Sunday.. San Francisco's decision to receive the ball after winning the overtime coin toss confused the general NFL world while also motivating some Chiefs players. 
LAS VEGAS — The Kansas City Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years on Sunday evening, but the San Francisco 49ers might’ve been tasked with the most significant decision during Super Bowl LVIII. The 49ers’ loss came in just the second overtime Super Bowl period in NFL history. 
Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 on Sunday, becoming the NFL's ninth repeat Super Bowl champs. 
Kyle Shanahan's decision to take the ball first in overtime of Super Bowl 58 sparked a ridiculous round of criticism 
When teams went 10-2 when taking the ball first in the previous iteration of the playoff overtime rules, the league stepped in and changed things so both teams were guaranteed to possess the ball in playoff OT. In Super Bowl LVIII, with these modified rules in hand, the San Francisco 49ers won the toss in overtime and took the ball. They drove  
For example, it was the largest comeback in Super Bowl history, and it also set the record for the most points scored in the final quarter of a Super Bowl, with a total of 19 points. Super Bowl overtime rules. In the NFL, if a Super Bowl (or any playoff game) ends in a tie at the end of regulation, it moves into overtime. 
Shanahan explains why he doesn't regret Super Bowl overtime decision originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area. SANTA CLARA — While many of the 49ers’ players were unaware of the NFL’s  
The 49ers may want to put the debate over the decision to get the ball first in overtime behind them, but behind-the-scenes footage from Super Bowl 2024 likely won’t help that cause very much  
Shanahan said if the game had been more like Kansas City’s 38-35 victory in Super Bowl LVII, he would have been more tempted to elect for his team to open overtime on defense. “If it was like the Super Bowl the year before, the one that seemed more like a shootout, I think I might have felt differently,” Shanahan said. 
The crux of the argument against Shanahan seems to be his decision to take the ball after winning the coin toss before overtime, the second in Super Bowl history and first in postseason play since  
Kyle Shanahan stands by his decisions in the 49ers' heartbreaking Super Bowl LVIII overtime loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday at Allegiant Stadium.. Tied at 19 points at the end of regulation, the 49ers won the overtime coin flip and opted to start with the ball, which ultimately resulted in rookie kicker Jake Moody giving San Francisco a 22-19 lead on the opening drive before Chiefs
