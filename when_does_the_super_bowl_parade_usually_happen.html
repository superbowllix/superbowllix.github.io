        <h2><strong>when does the super bowl parade usually happen why are super bowl ads expensive</strong></h2>
        <p>The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles go head-to-head in New Orleans this Sunday, February 9th. The winning team from the NFL’s annual Super Bowl game is usually celebrated at Walt Disney World with the Most Valuable Player (MVP) being part of the iconic “I’m going to Disney World!” commercial, before starring in a parade down Main Street U.S.A. 
The last few years of the Super Bowl parade have been at Disneyland in California.

Anyway, as for the 2025 Super Bowl parade on February 10, expect it to step off roughly 30 minutes or less before Festival of Fantasy. That parade has two showtimes on Monday: noon and 3pm. If we’re going by past precedent, the Super Bowl pre-parade will step off between 2:30 and 2:45 pm, just before the second Festival of Fantasy. 
Based on what happened the last time the Eagles won the Lombardi Trophy, the parade would likely take place midweek. In 2018, the Eagles’ Super Bowl parade happened the Thursday following the game. It was originally scheduled for Wednesday, but weather conditions pushed things back a day. City offices, courts, and schools were closed for the

In 2020, following the team’s victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, Feb. 2, the Chiefs’ Super Bowl parade marched through the city the following Wednesday, on Feb. 5. 
But since Super Bowl LVIII will be held this Sunday, February 11, 2024, I would say you’ve made a wise guess that the winning team would be visiting the resort on Monday, February 12, 2024. If that happens, I don’t believe an exact time will be announced, because the element of surprise will be a key part of the magic. 
The Rams Super Bowl parade is set for Wednesday, Feb. 16, Rams COO Kevin Demoff announced on Monday. The parade will reportedly start at 11 a.m. PT (2 p.m. ET) and is expected to take about 45  
I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information from the Disney playbook.

The Coliseum hosted the Super Bowl in 1973, and it was also home to the first-ever Super Bowl back in 1967. WATCH: Hollywood sign now reads 'RAMS HOUSE' for Rams' Super Bowl win
