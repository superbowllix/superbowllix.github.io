Bill Belichick has more Super Bowl appearances (9) than head coach in NFL history. With a 6-3 record in his nine appearances, he also has the most Super Bowl wins among head coaches. Previously, the record was held for many years by Don Shula, who went to six early Super Bowls with the Baltimore Colts and Miami Dolphins. 
Super Bowl-Winning Coaches. In total, 14 head coaches have won multiple Super Bowls. Another 21 have won a single Super Bowl, meaning 35 different head coaches have won at least one Super Bowl.

Who is the winningest coach in NFL history? The winningest NFL coach is Don Shula, who won 328 games in his career and led the Miami Dolphins to a perfect season in 1972. 
NFL Coaches with the Most Super Bowl Wins: Thirteen of the 32 different head coaches who have won a Super Bowl have done so more than once. Each coach who won multiple championships did so while leading the same team, but only four of them were able to do so more than once. With six Super Bowl victories, Bill Belichick leads all coaches, four

However, only two coaches (one per conference) get the chance to represent in the big game at the end of the season. Let's look at the head coach with the most trips to the Super Bowl. 
Most All-Time Super Bowl Appearances by NFL Head Coaches. The guys at the top of this list are the most legendary coaches in the NFL. If you have appeared in two or more Super Bowls, you are definitely doing something right. With that being said, it is hard not to be in awe of Bill Belichick’s accomplishments with the New England Patriots.

This will be Reid's sixth Super Bowl appearance as a head coach, and he enters with a 3-2 record in the Big Game. Super Bowl Here’s the latest news on the Eagles vs. Chiefs 2025 showdown.
