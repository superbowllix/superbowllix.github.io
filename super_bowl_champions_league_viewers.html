        <h2><strong>super bowl champions league viewers super bowl viewers wiki</strong></h2>
        <p>The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to date.A  
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
The NFL said that last year's Super Bowl drew in 62.5 million global viewers, which was a 10 percent increase from the year prior. Mexico and Canada combined for over 42 million viewers, but  
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl ‚Äî and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
What Has More Viewers: Super Bowl or Champions League Final? Champions League final vs. Super Bowl viewership reaches into the hundreds of millions, easily, for both games! Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, which ended as a 25-22 overtime win for the Chiefs, was the most-watched telecast in US history. 
More than 450 million viewers watched the 2023 UEFA Champions League Final; The Super Bowl LVII Between Eagles and Chiefs was the most viewed sporting event in 2023; More than 57 million viewers in the US watched digital live sports content at least once per month; An Average of 11.64 million viewers in the United States watched the 2023 NBA Finals 
Winter Games ‚Äì 2 Billion Viewers; UEFA Champions League Final ‚Äì 450 Million Viewers; Super Bowl ‚Äì 115.1 Million Viewers; Wimbledon ‚Äì 25.6 Million Viewers; NBA Finals ‚Äì 17.8 Million Viewers; World Cup of Rugby- 17 Million Viewers; Kentucky Derby ‚Äì 16.6 Million Viewers; The Masters ‚Äì 15 Million Viewers; World Series ‚Äì 14.73  
The Champions League final has generally averaged around 400 million viewers for the last five years with the 2021 Champions League Final between Chelsea and Manchester City being the most viewed event in the competition‚Äôs history with around 700 million viewers. Super Bowl, on the other hand, had failed to break the 100-million mark for the  
Moreover, the Champions League final is widely reported to generate 700 million viewers while, according to FC Business, a recent El Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid attracted 650 million  
The Super Bowl stands as a cultural phenomenon in the United States, while the Champions League final is established as a spectacle of truly global reach. Both events demonstrate the power of sport to bring together people from different cultures and nationalities, albeit with distinct focuses and geographical scopes. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl ‚Äî and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
Combined Twitter Following: 25.5M (Champions League) vs. 2.22M (Super Bowl) Champions League has over 10x the number of Twitter followers but only third of the total tweets. According to my quick math, Super Bowl viewers are tweeting 38 times more per Twitter follower compared to Champions League viewers.

Super Bowl 2025 ‚Äòcomes down to defense‚Äô Reigning champions the Chiefs are warm favourites to retain the Super Bowl, but the Eagles‚Äô impressive defense was in evidence again when they beat  
Its like the World Cup for Americans essentially, ton of casual viewers who just want to be involved in the festivities. Champions League is nothing like this, there is no commercials or halftime show hoopla, very few women watch and Champions League Final parties with children and wifes making themed snacks aren't common. 
UEFA's estimated global audience for the 2024 Champions League final would dwarf the viewership of the Super Bowl ‚Äî and even just taking live viewership into account, the club football match  
[Meirov] Numbers are in: Super Bowl LVI featuring the Rams and Bengals was watched by 112.3 million viewers across all platforms. That‚Äôs up 14% over last year‚Äôs Super Bowl. The NFL finishes a strong season with another massive number. What a year.üèà üëë 
The Champions League has also now incorporated a Super Bowl-esque showbiz element with on-field musical performances before kick-off. So, while the Super Bowl is, and likely will always be, the king of US sports, the wider sporting world pays much more attention to the Champions League final. Super Bowl vs Champions League final: Who wins? 
The Super Bowl is the yearly championship game of the National Football League (NFL), usually taking place on the second Sunday in February Since 2022. This event showcases the champions of the two NFL conferences: the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). </p>
