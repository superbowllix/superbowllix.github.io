This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos).

Patriots 4 unlikely Super Bowl champions who weren’t actually very ‘super’ Giants quarterback Eli Manning poses with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Patriots by a score of 21  
Given his hot play heading into Super Bowl XLVIII, Nick Foles winning the MVP may not have come as that much of a surprise. However, the fact that he didn’t start a game until Week 14, and the notion that he caught a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl makes Foles one of the most unlikely players to receive the supreme individual honor. 
It is not surprising to anyone that the New England Patriots are once again in the Super Bowl . The Giants weren't expected to be in the Super Bowl, but it will not be a surprise if they win 
The 2007 Giants have been mentioned in this thread a couple of times as an unlikely team but that wasn't even the unlikeliest Giants team to make a run to the Super Bowl. Following their narrow victory in Super Bowl XXV, the Giants had a quiet decade in the 90s, with only two 10+ win seasons and one playoff win in that span coming in 1993. 
Why they mattered: The 1980 Raiders might be one of the most unlikely Super Bowl champions in NFL history. They won without a Hall of Fame quarterback, Jim Plunkett, who was a castoff and backup  
Preseason odds placed the Bengals nowhere near the Super Bowl radar. They are one of the most unexpected Super Bowl entrants in the event's 56-year history. Here are the teams that join the latest  
NFL's 10 most unlikely playoff teams in Super Bowl era: 1999 Rams, 1996 Jaguars lead list of shocking seasons  This was a championship no one outside the Patriots locker room saw coming, and it  
The Super Bowl is by far the biggest stage in sports. More than 90 million people tune in to watch the final game of the NFL season each year. That means that all eyes are on the two teams that face off, which happen to be the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles in this year's showdown. 
The 49ers, seeking their third championship of the 1980s under coach Bill Walsh, had an 80% win probability when Super Bowl XXIII kicked off, but the opposing Bengals had league MVP Boomer Esiason  
Considered by many as one of the most outstanding regular-season quarterbacks, Manning solidified his status among the elite by securing his second Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl 50. Retiring as a five-time MVP, Manning held NFL records for most touchdowns (539) and passing yards (71,940), although these records have since been surpassed. 
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. 
However, if that fantasy scenario played out, neither the Chiefs nor Steelers would have anything on the aforementioned Jets, who became the most unlikely Super Bowl champions 47 years ago Tuesday. </p>
