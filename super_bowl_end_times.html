        <p>SUPER BOWL LVIII. What time did the Super Bowl end? The NFL championship game was one of just two Super Bowls to go to overtime and the Chiefs secured a famous victory at the death. 
Super Bowl XLVII, played on February 3, 2013, between the Ravens and the 49ers, lasted for 3 hours and 34 minutes in regular time. However, the game featured a 34-minute pause due to a power  
This obviously impacted what time the Super Bowl finished as well. This past season’s Super Bowl ended at 10:14 p.m. ET. With that understood, here is a look at what time you will want to be in front of the TV this year based on time zone. Super Bowl start time Eastern: 6:30 p.m. ET; SB start time Central: 5:30 p.m. CT 
This year’s Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans will start at 5:30 pm local (Central Time), so those on the East Coast will want to be ready to watch for a 6:30 pm local kick-off, Mountain Time Super Bowl kick-off is at 4:30, and those on the west coast will be able to tune in and catch kick off at 3:30 pm local time. 
Length of Super Bowl Quarters . The length of the quarters in the Super Bowl is no different than the length in a normal regular season game, and that is four 15 minute quarters or 1 hour of football. A normal NFL game usually lasts slightly longer than 3 hours. Of course the Super Bowl has a few extra commercials and a longer halftime show  
There are also lots of commercial breaks during the Super Bowl, with the prime-time TV slot featuring over 100 adverts! In 2025, the estimated cost of a 30-second ad spot for Super Bowl LIX will  
The Chiefs and 49ers last faced each other in Super Bowl LIV on February 2, 2020, where Kansas City won 31-20 thanks to a fourth-quarter comeback led by Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes. 
What time will the 2024 Super Bowl likely end? East Coasters can expect to be a bit sleepy Monday morning, as the 2024 Super Bowl will likely end around 10:00 p.m. ET. 
The 2023 Super Bowl kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox, but the pregame festivities will start well before then.  As mentioned, the Super Bowl end time is also impossible to predict, especially  
The average NFL game typically has 16 commercial breaks, and because of all the untimed stoppages in play, games don’t really have a set “end time.” The Super Bowl is even tougher to predict, thanks to all those expensive commercials and a full-blown concert at halftime, headlined this year by Usher. 
But, yes, it’s true: “End Racism” will be absent from Super Bowl LIX. In its place will be “Choose Love.” According to Silver, this will be the first time the “End Racism” slogan  
Super Bowl 2025 kickoff time. The AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs are playing the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. Mountain/5:30 p  
Super Bowl 2025 time. The Super Bowl in 2025 is slated for a 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff. All the pregame festivities take place throughout the day, meaning you'll want to tune in earlier to catch things  
Sunday's game will be the first Super Bowl since February 2021 at which "End Racism" will not be in an end zone stencil. "The Super Bowl is often a snapshot in time and the NFL is in a unique  
The NFL has confirmed that it will remove the phrase “End Racism” from the end zones at Caesars Superdome ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl, replacing it with the neutral “Choose Love.” The move comes as Donald Trump and his allies escalate attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and major corporations—including  
Visual presentations of information get more views than written presentations. So, in order to possibly reach more people; I put the SB 59 syncs into video format and added in some additional info. 
President Donald Trump will attend the game when the Chiefs aim to become the first team in NFL history to three-peat during the Super Bowl era.. Two people familiar with the league’s thinking shot down the notion that Trump’s presence is the reason why “End Racism” isn’t being stenciled in an end zone at the Super Bowl for the first time since the league began doing it. 
The Chiefs' last Super Bowl win came at the end of the 2023 season, when they edged the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, in Super Bowl LVIII, in the Las Vegas area. 23. 
For the first time since 2021, the Super Bowl will not feature the "end racism" message written in the back of one of the end zones. The Super Bowl 59 matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and  
Super Bowl LVIII in 2024 ended at 10:46 pm Eastern, but that was with almost an entire overtime period, so remember showing that the end time is always a rough estimation. This year’s Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans will start at 5:30 pm local, CT, so on the East Coast, fans ready to watch for a 6:30 pm ET kick-off. </p>
