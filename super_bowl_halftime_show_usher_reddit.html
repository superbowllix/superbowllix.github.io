        <h2><strong>super bowl halftime show usher reddit black national anthem at super bowl 2025 booed</strong></h2>
        <p>I enjoyed every bit of it. I was working during Super Bowl LVIII, so I couldn't give the show my full attention throughout. Seeing Alicia Keys and H.E.R. were pleasant surprises. I expected to see Ludacris and Lil Jon and they killed it! A huge chunk of this halftime show took me way back to my college days! 
A field goal is a valid play you can attempt from anywhere on the field during any of your four downs. The Chiefs were not able to score a touchdown to win so they chose the easier field goal to tie the game. 
So most of the time when there the need for a bunch of people on rollerskates, it gets through our network pretty quickly. Roller, derby, aggressive, and session/jam skaters are surprisingly populous, and the network is pretty intimate. I’m going to guess that I’m probably one or two people removed from the skaters at the Super Bowl. 
Having joined the Black Eyed Peas in their Super Bowl XLV halftime show in 2011, Usher should have known better. He should have stepped out of his comfort zone to score a touchdown. 
Usher has some sage advice for performing at the Super Bowl. The R&amp;B star reflected on his experience headlining the 2024 halftime show during a recent interview on The Jennifer Hudson Show  
If there's one undeniable fact about Usher, it's that he knows how to put on a performance!The R&amp;B crooner, 45, pulled out all the stops for his Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show on  
See more reactions to Usher's 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show, below: Celebrities at the 2024 Super Bowl See stars such as Paul Rudd, Post Malone and more in attendance at Super Bowl 58 on Feb. 11  
Usher plays Super Bowl halftime show:R&amp;B icon brought skates, abs, famous friends and a Vegas vibe X user @redforjanet used a past clip of an emotional Beyoncé interview to describe her feelings  
Usher emerged at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium for the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show, an immediate confirmation of his position as the ideal halftime performer: one with timeless, well-known hits, masterful choreography, and a devoted audience. 
Usher put on a good show, but more importantly he put on a very Usher show. He is as dependable as a homecooked meal at your mom's house. Equal parts ridiculous spectacle and show-stopping romanticism, Usher's tour through the music of the 2000s was exciting, even at moments when it should've been a little cringe. 
“It’s an honor of a lifetime to finally check a Super Bowl performance off my bucket list. I can’t wait to bring the world a show unlike anything else they’ve seen from me before,” Usher said in a statement. “Thank you to the fans and everyone who made this opportunity happen. I’ll see you real soon.” 
Except the people who listened to Usher 20 years ago are the main demographic for the Super Bowl now. It’s not Aerosmith or Madonna. At least Usher isn’t as awkwardly sexual as he was when he started. Find his performance on the Chris Rock show. He was just taking his pants off for a cable talk show studio audience. 
On the 20th Anniversary of that famous halftime show, Swift will take everyone by surprise: singing a duet with Usher and in a shocking finale rip Usher's shirt to reveal his pastied nip. Excuse me for one moment while I check Vegas odds 
Alicia Keys being there made perfect sense. She and Usher collabed on “My Boo” in 2004 and it was a hit. Usher was long retired before she got to the scene. No. Alicia Keys’ first album was released in 2001, same year as Usher’s 8701. Usher was well established but hardly retired. He hadn’t even released Confessions yet. Cee Lo in glasses 
Yup, 37 checking in. Wasn’t ever a big Usher fan per se (seemed like the girls were way more into his music than the guys when I/we were coming of age) but totally respect his hard work and talent and he put on a great show. 
The memes flooding my feed facilitated so many trips to Chipotle at this point I’m convinced it was one of the greatest marketing schemes of all time. Adam not fully transforming into a Chipotle Bag has actually been surprising, I thought the Super Bowl was a career transition for him into the food industry! 
I really don't know why they don't just pay for a halftime show and get the biggest names possible. I know that there are some big time Usher fans out there, but I feel like most Americans have a pretty indifferent response to him. And most Americans are who watches the super bowl. I still think they can't really top the Dr Dre one. 
Idk about any of you but I’m so excited for Ushers super bowl halftime show performance tonight‼️ I have been a fan of his since the age of 7 and he is a major influence in the music industry. He still puts on a great show at the age of 45 so I know tonight he’s gonna leave it all on that stage. 
Lots of hate in this thread. Usher is a megastar with megahits. He hasn't had one recently but okay, neither had Prince or Paul McCartney when they performed theirs. Usher's a worthy artist for the Halftime show. I'd say he's done more than the Weeknd did so yea, he deserves it. 
Most people see the Super Bowl as more of a “free exposure” move since they aren’t paid for it and most artists have to pay for the show themselves. Like Rihanna did it and had that little fenty beauty shot that made sales like double(not sure if it was double but sales were definitely boosted a lot). </p>
