        <p>In the case of the Vikings, however, the Super Bowl existed at the time they won their only league title (in 1969).

The Jets are followed up by the Miami Dolphins with a 49-season drought, with their most recent Super Bowl coming in the 1973 season. The Dolphins won the 1972 Super Bowl as well, going undefeated at 17-0, the only team to ever do such a thing. The final three teams to never win a Super Bowl are the Jaguars, Texans, and Carolina Panthers. The

The longest currently active Super Bowl drought belongs to the Arizona Cardinals, who have gone 77 seasons without winning the Super Bowl. This drought pre-dates the modern Super Bowl era, so before 1966 the drought also counts seasons since they last won the NFL Championship. 
The Vikings, on the other hand, aren't winning in spite of their lottery ticket at quarterback. They're often winning because of him. You could count two, maybe three, of the team's 16 games where

The Minnesota Vikings have famously never won a Super Bowl nor, unless you want to count the 1969 season, a true championship during the 63-year history of their franchise. This is one of the longest droughts in the “Big Four” North American sports which includes the MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL. 
There are also seven other teams with excruciatingly long Super Bowl droughts, from the Dallas Cowboys (28 years) to the New York Jets (55).. Here's a look at the list of long-time losers still  
Now, former Vikings RB Dalvin Cook has a chance to help end another extensive Super Bowl drought after signing a deal with the New York Jets. The Jets won Super Bowl III back in 1968, but they haven’t been able to get to that mountaintop again since Joe Namath led them there. </p>
