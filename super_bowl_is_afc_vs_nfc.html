        <p>SUPER BOWL 2024. AFC vs NFC: who has won more Super Bowls? While the Super Bowl is the ultimate battle between two final NFL teams, earlier divisional battles are just as competitive. 
This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos). 
After the merger, the AFC was the dominant conference in terms of Super Bowl wins throughout the 1970s, and the NFC won a long stretch of consecutive Super Bowls through the 1980s and mid 1990s (13 wins in a row). For the last decade, the two conferences have been more evenly matched. 
AFC vs. NFC. As we head into Super Bowl 58, the NFC has a slight lead over the AFC, with a 29-28 record in Super Bowls. This includes all 53 games since 1970 when the league changed from the NFL vs. AFL format to the current NFC vs. AFC format. The winning conference alternates fairly regularly with the Kansas City Chiefs of the AFC as the  
The Dallas Cowboys are 5-3 in the NFC against the AFC in Super Bowls all-time.

Mike Florio and Michael Holley unpack how although there has been recent dominance in the AFC with the Patriots’ and Chiefs’ Super Bowl wins, there was a long stretch of NFC dominance before that. 
The NFL will hold its 58th iteration of the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 11. The AFC will take on the NFC at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. The NFL has had its current NFC vs. AFC format since 1970, and the four years prior, it was the AFL vs. NFL. Let’s take a look at how the AFC has fared in football’s biggest game of the year. 
The AFC and NFC, formed during the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, have evolved as the pillars of the NFL. The AFC has recently taken the lead in Super Bowl titles, thanks to the dominance of teams like the

The Indianapolis Colts have a 2-1 record in the AFC against the NFC in Super Bowls all-time. 
The NFL teams became NFC, and the AFL teams became AFC. Three teams switched at the merger to make the conferences the same size -- Colts, Steelers, and Browns moved from the NFL to the AFC conference. The Seahawks are the only other conference-switching team -- 1 year in the NFC, then a couple decades in the AFC, and now back in the NFC. 
The National Football Conference (NFC) currently leads with 29 Super Bowl victories, while the American Football Conference (AFC) has 28. The Chiefs' recent successes have narrowed this gap, and a  
The matchup for Super Bowl 59 (LIX) is set after the NFL's Championship Sunday. The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will meet in the 2025 Super Bowl for the second time in three seasons. 
The Kansas City Chiefs vs. Philadelphia Eagles will be broadcast on Fox in Super Bowl LIX to wrap up the 2025 NFL playoffs at 5:30 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 9. Kevin Burkhardt (play-by-play) and Tom Brady (analyst) will call the game from the booth at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. 
More specifically, since the first Super Bowl in 1967, the NFC East has been the most successful division in the NFL, grabbing 21 NFC championships and 13 Super Bowl victories.
