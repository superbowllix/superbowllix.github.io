Fair perspective! I think I, along with the majority of America, loved last year’s show - but totally understand appreciating a more simple quality show. I think back to shows like prince, Beyoncé, MJ - def can carry on their own. But then when I think of maroon 5 and black eyed peas def def needed the guests to make it bearable lol. 
The Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show takes place on Sunday, February 12, 2023, and despite rumors, Taylor Swift will not be performing at the Arizona event, TMZ and People report. According to TMZ, Swift was asked to perform at the NFL’s show, but declined the opportunity so that she can continue the process of re-recording her back  
Kansas City and Philadelphia face off on Feb. 9 in New Orleans' Caesars Superdome. If you can't attend the Big Game in person, here's how to watch the show on TV or stream it online. 
As if Kendrick Lamar’s recent history-making wins at the 2025 Grammys weren’t enough to get you exc ited for his upcoming Super Bowl LIX halftime performance, then theorizing about which songs  
The first Super Bowl halftime show that Chiefs fans probably didn't pay a whole lot of attention to (which is a shame, if true) was when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez took the stage in Super Bowl LIV  
While Kendrick Lamar’s halftime show will garner most of the headlines around Super Bowl 59’s music,  National Anthem odds for Super Bowl 59. Length Odds; Over 120.5 seconds-152: Under 120.  
Kendrick Lamar is set to take center stage at the Super Bowl Halftime show on Sunday, Feb. 9 in New Orleans' Caesar Superdome, just ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles versus Kansas City Chiefs game launching at 6:30 pm ET. 
Sure, Patrick Mahomes has put on a show at the Super Bowl before, but I’m ecstatic to see Compton Native Kun Fu Kenny take the biggest stage for the second time in his career. Back in 2022, Lamar co-headlined Super Bowl LVI with legends Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, and Mary J. Blige in Inglewood, California. 
How to Use Our Free Super Bowl Prop Bet Sheet. If you want to create an office pool or have extra fun at a Super Bowl party, just print this sheet and give a copy to each contestant. They should fill in their answers before the game, and each correct pick brings you points. The simple scoring option would be for each pick to bring one point. 
Mary J Blige opens up with “Be Without You” Dr. Dre comes out with Snoop and they perform “Still DRE” and “Next Episode” Em comes in from under the stage and performs “Forgot About Dre” with Dr. Dre Then Em performs “Till I Collapse” with a Nate Dogg hologram Em quickly performs “Soldier” (just 1 verse and hook) Kendrick comes in and quickly performs “Maad city  
Check out the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, it was truly awesome IMO. hell even Justin Timberlake last year did it way better than this one. Reply reply More replies Doitchebag 
I’m fairly certain Bruno Mars and The Weeknd did it fully live as well, as far as the pop star headliners go. I remember reading a comment from someone who worked with The Weeknd for his 2021 BBMAs performance (the one with the moving cars) stating he always insists on doing everything live, while from my knowledge Bruno doesn’t do lip syncing - and we know how that man loves his choreography. 
I was working at a restaurant during the Super Bowl that year and I remember the game was on in the managers office so people could just filter in and out and kind of keep tabs on what was going on. But when that halftime show started I think every employee in that building was jammed into that office just watching it unfold in awe. 
Answer: the show wasn’t “bad” as in like last years where maroon 5 just tanked and had a bad show. This years show was very good but there are some people deriding that the show was “overtly sexual” and not appropriate for younger viewers. The guys liked it. 
I’ll take any excuse to talk about Phish on PH - on NYE 2019 they did a stunt where the 4 band members played an entire set on raised platforms with ropes but the frontman’s platform didn’t descend so he was stuck up there prob 50 feet above the stage until the end of the show and they had to use another platform to rescue him. 
It makes me so sad, at his best Kanye was a symbol of hope and the ability to fight mental illness and create meaning. The fact that he has seemingly failed and completely gone off the deep end just takes that away from me - it’s hard to feel inspiration or comfort in his music anymore. 
If I remember correctly, the 1989 halftime show was supposed to be viewed while wearing 3-D glasses. Coke/Diet Coke had this big promo and included the glasses when buying the product. Coke had the 1st ever 3-D commercial that aired just before the performa 
Olivia just needs another album or 2 out and time to develop her stage presence fully and she’ll be plenty big enough with enough of the “right” kind of hits for a halftime show. Billie is probably big enough and with the stage presence already, but her issue is a ton of her music, and especially the hits, are too slow for the halftime show. 
The memes flooding my feed facilitated so many trips to Chipotle at this point I’m convinced it was one of the greatest marketing schemes of all time. Adam not fully transforming into a Chipotle Bag has actually been surprising, I thought the Super Bowl was a career transition for him into the food industry! </p>
