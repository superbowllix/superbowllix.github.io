        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.

T here have been 820 quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era — 34 have won a Super Bowl; and 13 have won more than one Super Bowl. If Patrick Mahomes wins next Sunday, he will join Troy Aikman (3), Terry Bradshaw (4), Joe Montana (4), and Tom Brady (7) as the only quarterbacks to win three or more Super Bowls.

Super Bowl QBs tale of the tape: Jalen Hurts vs. Patrick Mahomes as Eagles rematch Chiefs in NFL championship Which signal-caller has the edge for Super Bowl Sunday? 
Concluding his career as a seven-time Super Bowl champion, five-time Super Bowl MVP, and three-time NFL MVP, Brady’s legacy seems challenging for any quarterback to surpass. His legendary performances in numerous high-pressure games, including the masterful comeback against the Falcons in Super Bowl LI, firmly established Brady as the  
In 1964, Joe Namath was the first football quarterback to win both a Super Bowl and college championship when his Jets beat the Colts in Super Bowl III, as Jetswire reports. Joe Montana matched the feat about 13 years later when he won four Super Bowls with the Niners. He won the college championship with Notre Dame in 1977. 
Ben Roethlisberger has won two Super Bowl rings with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the first at Super Bowl XL in 2006 and the second in Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. He also lost Super Bowl XLV in 2011. Ben was the quarterback of the Miami Redhawks while at Miami and is the career record holder for pass completions. The school has since retired his jersey 
Tom Brady’s seven Super Bowl wins are the most among any quarterbacks — and all players — in NFL history. Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana are both tied for second all-time among starting quarterbacks with four Super Bowl victories. With Brady’s retirement, Patrick Mahomes is the active leader for most Super Bowls among quarterbacks. 
The vast majority of Super Bowl-winning starters since 1994, however, own cap hits that take up between 10.6% and 12.3% of their respective team's entire salary cap, per Thompson. (Market-leading  
Sifting through all of the possibilities, Solak predicted that if the Raiders don't land Darnold then they will sign two former Super Bowl champion quarterbacks on one-year deals: Aaron Rodgers of  
The championship game is also significant from a cultural standpoint, marking just the second time in Super Bowl history that both starting quarterbacks are Black. 
For Super Bowl champions, climbing back to the top of the mountain is no easy task, either.  Mega deals for quarterbacks can put a limit on what teams are capable of adding elsewhere. MORE  </p>
