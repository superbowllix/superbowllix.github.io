        <h2><strong>most super bowl viewers ever super bowl lviii medio tiempo</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
5. Super Bowl LI (2017) brought in 111.32 million viewers. The New England Patriots won against the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34 to 28. 6. Super Bowl XLV (2011) brought in 111 million viewers  
Super Bowl television ratings have traditionally been high. One of the most watched annual sporting events in the world, the NFL's championship game is broadcast in over 130 countries in more than 30 languages. [1] Viewership is predominantly North American; [2] [3] the Super Bowl is the most watched television broadcast in the United States  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
Last year's "Kelce Bowl" matchup between the Eagles and Chiefs was previously the most-watched Super Bowl ever, followed by the New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks game in 2015 (114.4  
The first Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl in 2023 set an all-time record with 115.1 million viewers only to have it broken again last year, when the Chiefs-49ers overtime thriller became the first Super  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. Univision averaged 2.3 million viewers, the highest Super Bowl viewership on record for a Spanish-language network. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the United States since 2014. 
Adding in the out-of-home viewing Nielsen tracked from 2016-19, the most-watched Super Bowl on record was actually Patriots-Falcons in 2017. New England’s famous 28-3 comeback averaged 112 million viewers officially, but 124.6 million including out-of-home — easily the largest Super Bowl audience Nielsen has ever measured. 
Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched program in television history, with an average of 123.7 million viewers tuning in to the Chiefs' 25-22 overtime win versus the 49ers. 
Here Are the Top 10 Most-Watched Super Bowl Halftime Shows. From Usher, Rihanna and Beyoncé to Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake, here are the Super Bowl halftime shows with the most viewership. 
Super Bowl LVII ranks as the second most-watched Super Bowl ever, behind only Super Bowl XLIX, when the New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 1, 2015. Audience estimates for Super Bowl LVII are inclusive of digital (DTVR) and out-of-home (OOH) viewing, and viewing via the Fox Sports app, Fox Now and NFL+. 
The 10 Most Expensive Super Bowl Ads Ever, Ranked The 2025 Super Bowl is around the corner, and companies are prepared to shell out tons of money to advertise during the big game. Every year  
Each year, the Super Bowl draws upward of 100 million eyeballs—Super Bowl LVIII 2024 was the most-watched program in U.S. history, averaging 123.7 million viewers—and a significant chunk of  
The most-watched Super Bowl Halftime Show is Michael Jackson’s iconic 1993 set at Super Bowl XXVII, drawing a reported 133.4 million American viewers. Before Jackson, the Halftime Show was largely uneventful and featured less appealing acts. 
The longest Super Bowl game will also go down as the most-watched program in television history. 
The Super Bowl is generally so widely viewed that the networks not airing the game don't put up much of a fight, airing reruns, old movies, and cheaply made counter-programming. But in 1992, the Fox network attempted to draw viewers away from CBS's Super Bowl broadcast at halftime. 
The Los Angeles Raiders dominated the Washington Redskins, 38-9, at Tampa Stadium in Super Bowl XVIII. While the game itself was not that memorable, in one of the most iconic Super Bowl commercials ever, Apple debuted the Macintosh computer in an advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that was influenced by George Orwell's “1984.” 
The revised numbers also make Rihanna’s halftime performance the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show ever with 121.0 million viewers. Nielsen reprocessed the entire day for 44 local markets  
Fox's Super Bowl telecast has "a chance" to be the most-watched Super Bowl, said NFL Chief Media and Business Officer Brian Rolapp. Rolapp spoke to CNBC Sport from Radio Row in New Orleans, the  </p>
