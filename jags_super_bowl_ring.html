        <p>Did Maurice Jones-Drew win Super Bowl ring? Breaking down NFL Network's viral claim on ex-Jaguars RB. By Andre Castillo. Modified Feb 06, 2024 06:05 GMT. Follow Us. Share. 0 Discuss. 
Even with such stellar personal accolades, Maurice couldn’t win a Super Bowl ring or even championships. Sadly for him, his personal high coincided with the Jaguars’ most lackluster NFL era. Maurice played for Jacksonville from 2006 to 2011 and in that period, the Jaguars averaged a mediocre seven wins over those six years.

The Jacksonville Jaguars have not yet reached the Super Bowl, as of December 2024. In fact, they are one of the four teams that have not yet appeared in the Super Bowls. 
The rings have an economic impact and create jobs: The production of Super Bowl rings by Jostens at its Denton County, Texas, facility generates $2.1 million in economic output locally, $1.4  
The Colts would never score again, as the momentum shifted the Saints way. Brunell earned his first and only Super Bowl ring with the New Orleans Saints when the team won its first franchise championship by defeating the Indianapolis Colts 31–17 in Super Bowl XLIV. 
Gabbert spent a few seasons in Tampa Bay. In 2020, he got his first Super Bowl as Tom Brady's backup, as the squad defeated the Kansas City Chiefs.
