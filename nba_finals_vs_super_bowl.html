        <h2><strong>nba finals vs super bowl when does super bowl weekend start</strong></h2>
        <p>Is it harder to win the Super Bowl or the NBA title?  NBA Finals. 2011 - Dallas Mavericks vs Miami Heat. Star matchup: Dirk Nowitski vs LeBron James. 2012 - Oklahoma City Thunder vs Miami Heat. 
In the history of championships in major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada (which include the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL), a city/metropolitan area has been home to multiple championships in a season 19 times, most recently in 2020 when the Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2020 Stanley Cup and Tampa Bay Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV. 
The 2021 NBA Finals were about as successful as a Milwaukee vs. Phoenix matchup in July could be, and grew 32% in total viewers from last year's series (when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the  
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event of the year by a wide margin. People who haven’t watched a single NFL game all year will plan Super Bowl parties. That’s not to say that people consciously think ‘winning the Super Bowl is more impressive than winning the NBA Finals’. But way more people care about the former than the latter. 
Compare the Super Bowl to the entirety of the NBA Finals. Compare a Wild Card Round game to a first-round NBA matchup. Compare a single regular season NFL game to a span of five NBA games. 
Who played in the NBA’s version of the Super Bowl? In the first official NBA vs. ABA  only a handful of NBA Finals have featured a former ABA team vs. an NBA team with most coming due to the  
In Super Bowl LI, the New England Patriots were able to come back from a 28-9 Atlanta Falcon lead in order to capture the Vince Lombardi trophy. There has, however, been a trend of poor super bowl performances, and fans are starting to question the importance of watching. NBA becoming predictable. The NBA finals have been a piece of work as well. 
In the context of the current state of the television industry, Super Bowl LVII beat the NBA Finals' viewership by a significant margin. The former reportedly had 113.06 million viewers tuned in. 
The Kansas City Chiefs' second consecutive Super Bowl win could lead to success for an NBA powerhouse, according to history. The Miami Heat have been 0-2 in the NBA Finals since 2020, but have  
In the great debate between the NBA Finals and the Super Bowl, it's hard to definitively say which event is bigger. Both sporting events have massive followings and draw in huge audiences from around the world. While the Super Bowl may have a slight edge in terms of TV viewership and advertising revenue, the NBA Finals can be just as intense and competitive. Personally, I think it's a matter

With the 2021 Super Bowl 55 about to take place and the 2021 Champions League also very much underway i thought i would battle the two against eachother to s 
There's one day left, and that's Super Bowl Sunday. Let's take a look at my three best player prop bets for Super Bowl LIX between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, February 9.

The 2021 NBA Finals were about as successful as a Milwaukee vs. Phoenix matchup in July could be, and grew 32% in total viewers from last year’s series (when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the  
The 2024 NBA Finals were watched by an average of 11.3 million viewers in the United States. This marked a decline from the previous year when over 11.6 million viewers tuned in to watch the  
They aren’t even a year removed from their NBA Finals appearance in June 2024, and are hoping that the swap of stars will help elevate them immediately from where they currently sit in the 8th spot in the Western Conference. Doncic-Davis trade odds adjustment @ESPNBET; Lakers to win NBA Finals: 40-1 to 18-1. Mavericks to win NBA Finals: 25-1  
I argued that due to the importance of coaching/game planning, higher injury potential, and difficulty for a team to be carried by 1 player it is harder to win a super bowl. Plus the fact that the most Super Bowls won by a team is 6 and the most NBA finals won by a team is 17 (both records held by my beloved hometown Boston teams by the way). 
The Chiefs won Super Bowl 44 against San Francisco before losing Super Bowl 45 to Tom Brady-led Tampa Bay 31-9 the following season. Now, Mahomes has a chance to finish off a three-peat. 
Mahomes’ Super Bowl wins came against Jimmy Garoppolo, Jalen Hurts, and Brock Purdy. Hurts finished second in the NFL MVP voting in 2022. Mahomes averages 267.8 passing yards per game with seven touchdowns and five interceptions in those Super Bowl appearances. Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals. Jordan was 6-0 in NBA Finals and won six Finals  
Let's pretend the NBA Finals was single elimination. 11% of Americans say basketball is their favorite sport. 7% of Americans say soccer is their favorite sport. 37% of Americans say football is their favorite sport. If the Super Bowl had 113m viewers, we'd expect the Finals to get 34m viewers. The World Cup final had 25m US viewers this year. </p>
