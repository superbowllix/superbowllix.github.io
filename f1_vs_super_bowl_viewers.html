        <h2><strong>f1 vs super bowl viewers super bowl food low calorie</strong></h2>
        <p>Viewers tune in from all across the world to watch the Super Bowl. The NFL also has a huge pop culture following, and it’s even more romanticized by the College Football aspect and high school sports. We see it in movies, TV shows, and documentaries, and it’s difficult to imagine a world where American Football doesn’t exist. F1 vs NFL  
The NFL changed television viewing immeasurably and by 1986 it was the highest rated television programme of any kind, with over 120 million viewers. The 2023 edition of the Super Bowl, which saw  
Earlier Super Bowls did better when it comes to TV ratings, with the highest-rated Super Bowl being a 49.1 in 1982 between the 49ers and Bengals. Of the five highest-rated Super Bowls ever, four  
The 2025 viewership numbers most closely align with those of 2023, with Conference Championships drawing about 1.3% more viewers, Divisional Round viewership up 0.8%, and Wild Card \viewership  
So, while Chiefs-Eagles had the most views at 114.21 million, the highest-rated Super Bowl remains the 49ers-Bengals, when the ratings set a Super Bowl record of 49.1, indicating 49.1 percent of  
Formula One exceeded an average of one million viewers for a full season for the first time in 2022. However, the figure of 1.21 million viewers per race for that season has not been matched since. The series averaged 1.1 million viewers in 2023 and is currently averaging 1.16 million viewers before this weekend’s US Grand Prix. 
The Kansas City Chiefs' victory over the Buffalo Bills averaged 57.4 million viewers on CBS, making it the most-watched AFC Championship game in National Football League (NFL) history  
The most straightforward metric is to compare viewership from the 2018 season with the current year, a statistic that emphasises the growth of the series in nearly seven years on ESPN. Formula One averaged 539,190 viewers in 2018, a number that the series has fallen below just once this year. That race was the Japanese Grand Prix, which began  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
2014: FOX said Super Bowl XLVIII had a streaming average minute audience of 528,000 viewers and peak concurrent viewership of 1.1 million, with users spending an average of 47.8 minutes watching the stream. 2013: CBS Sports said Super Bowl XLVII had a streaming average minute audience of 508,000 with an average viewing time of 38 minutes. The  
John and Jim Harbaugh head-to-head meetings. While Super Bowl 47 had the brightest lights of any head-to-head Harbaugh games, there's actually been another prior instance of John and Jim's NFL  
Per Polymarket odds, Super Bowl LIX’s viewership is favored to land between 115 million and 120 million (+355). 120 million to 125 million (+376) is not out of the question, either. This year, the Super Bowl will air on Fox. The biggest wild card for Super Bowl LIX is Tubi, a FAST service. With Tubi, consumers can watch the Super Bowl for  
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
How many people watch the CFP National Championship? Last year's edition of the CFP title game had a viewership of 17 million people, making it the least watched in the history of the event  
Super Bowl 55 averaged 98.2 million viewers, the game's lowest mark in 13 years, but the viewership bounced back slightly with 101.1 million viewers for Super Bowl 56 between the Bengals and Rams  
The Chiefs vs. 49ers Super Bowl drew 123.4 million average viewers on Sunday — the most-watched game in NFL history, up seven percent from last year's Super Bowl. CBS also claimed it is the most  
Here in Sweden thay say who have won the Super Bowl and maybe show 15 sec of pictures once a year, I dont know but I think one of the cable channels also show Super Bowl but thats all. It's the same with Indy500 exept for 1999 when Kenny Bräck won, than thay showed 1 min of pictures from the race Only the Olympics and Soccer WC is bigger then F1. 
“More than 200 million viewers (202.4) watched all or part of Super Bowl LVIII across networks, the highest unduplicated total audience in history and up +10% vs. last year’s Super Bowl  
Here's a bit of comparison between Miami GP and Super Bowl to prove that F1 is indeed a major threat to NFL's reign in the United States. 
The Super Bowl is not only a celebration of football, but also a global phenomenon that continues to evolve, remaining one of the most relevant events in global entertainment, with a massive audience year after year. In 2024, Super Bowl LVIII set a new record, averaging 123.4 million viewers across  </p>
