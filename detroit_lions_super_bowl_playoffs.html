        <p>The Detroit Lions last made the playoffs in 2024, when they lost the Divisional Round.  Lions have never won a Super Bowl. The closest they came to winning a Super  
Detroit Lions Playoff History. Team Names: Portsmouth Spartans, Detroit Lions Seasons: 95 (1930 to 2024) Record (W-L-T): 606-709-34 Playoff Record: 9-15 Super Bowls Won: 0 (0 Appearances) 
The Detroit Lions are 9-14 in 23 NFL playoff games all-time across 18 appearances. Here's what you need to know entering 2025 postseason.  4-1 in pre-Super Bowl championships: Detroit does have  
The Lions’ win in this season’s Wild Card Round was their first playoff win since 1991. How Many Super Bowl Appearances Do the Lions Have? The Detroit Lions have never made an appearance in the Super Bowl. The Lions are one of four teams that have never reached the Super Bowl, along with the Cleveland Browns, Jacksonville Jaguars, and  
The Lions do have a rich NFL history despite not appearing in the Super Bowl. Detroit won four NFL Championships including three in the 1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback. Detroit was NFL Champions in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. 
However, change has come in Detroit and it warrants a deeper look. To begin, it took the Lions three years to make their first Super Bowl playoff appearance in 1970. That being said, the game ended in a 5-0 loss against the Dallas Cowboys. Their next appearances were in 1982 and 1983, but yet again found themselves in the loss column. 
Just last offseason, the Detroit Lions had legitimate reasons to hope that a Super Bowl run could come in their 2024 campaign.. They were fresh off a narrow 34-31 NFC championship game defeat  
Detroit Lions Playoff Appearances Year-by-Year. The Detroit Pistons playoff record is 9-14 in 23 games as of December 2024. In the Wild Card Round, they played in 10 games, winning one, and in six  
In the pre-Super Bowl days, the Lions won four NFL championship games between 1935 and 1957. The first Super Bowl was played in January 1967, so Detroit's championships do not count as Super Bowl  
The Lions have yet to appear in a Super Bowl, but they are 4-1 all-time in championship games. Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships  
In just a few days, the 59th Super Bowl will take place, and for the 59th consecutive time, it will not feature the Detroit Lions. This year, it felt like the Lions may finally break the streak  
The Detroit Lions are entering 2025 with a renewed sense of purpose, a bolstered roster, and an elite coaching staff. After a heartbreaking but promising 2024 season, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the Lions will not only be contenders in 2025 but will WIN Super Bowl LX. 
The Detroit Lions are once again the favorites to win Super Bowl 59.. After a dominant, exclamation point win over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18, the Lions are the favorite to win the Super Bowl at +280, according to BetMGM, meaning a $10 bet would net you $28 profit, plus your $10 back. 
The Brief. The Detroit Lions earned the No. 1 seed in the playoffs, giving them a bye week and home field advantage; But who they will play is a mystery, with the top seed playing the lowest  
The Detroit Lions may have the easiest path to the Super Bowl of any team still left vying for it. By John Buhler | Jan 16, 2025 Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, Detroit Lions / Gregory Shamus  
PLAYOFF PICKS: NFL Week 19 Picks: Spread, Moneyline, Over/Under - USA TODAY Here are the Super Bowl picks from six Detroit Free Press writers, with each predicting the Lions to make it to New Orleans. 
Detroit Lions safety Kerby Joseph (31) tackles L.A. Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua (17) during the second half of the NFL wild-card playoff game at Ford Field in Detroit on Sunday, Jan, 14, 2024. 
I think the Lions win the next two games against the Bears and 49ers with relative ease; neither team can put up points like the Bills. It's the Week 18 showdown with the Vikings that will dictate their playoff success. If the Lions win that one and get a first-round bye, there's no reason they can't go to the Super Bowl. 
The Detroit Lions picked up a crucial 31-9 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18, as Dan Campbell's squad clinched the NFC North title and No.1 seed in the conference, meaning Detroit will  
Brock Purdy threw for 267 yards and a touchdown, and the San Francisco 49ers rallied from 17 points down at halftime to beat the Detroit Lions 34-31 and reach the Super Bowl. </p>
