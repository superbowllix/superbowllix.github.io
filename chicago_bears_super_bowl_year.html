        <h2><strong>chicago bears super bowl year super bowl printable decorations</strong></h2>
        <p>How many Super Bowls have the Chicago Bears won? The Chicago Bears have won one Super Bowl in two appearances as of 2024. The Bears won Super Bowl XX in 1985. It was the first-ever Super Bowl  
The two teams also met in the 1985 and 1990 playoffs, splitting each meeting en route to a Super Bowl championship (Bears in Super Bowl XX, Giants in Super Bowl XXV). As of the 2023 season, the Bears lead the all-time series 36–25–2. 
Super Bowl matchups by year. Super Bowl 1: Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10;  Super Bowl 20: Chicago Bears 46, New England Patriots 10; Super Bowl 21: New York Giants 39, Denver  
The Bears defeated the Patriots by the score of 46–10, capturing their first NFL championship since 1963, three years prior to the birth of the Super Bowl. Super Bowl XX was played on January 26, 1986, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans . 
The Chicago Bears last won the Super Bowl in the 1985 season. The Bears beat the New England Patriots 46-10 in the Super Bowl. When was the last time the Chicago Bears lost the Super Bowl? The Chicago Bears last lost the Super Bowl in the 2006 season. 
III: The Bears taped "The Super Bowl Shuffle" at the Park West in Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 3, hours after landing in Chicago following their only loss of the season, a 38-24 defeat on Monday Night Football in Miami. Walter Payton and Jim McMahon taped their portions later via a green screen in a racquetball court at Halas Hall. 
Super Bowl XLI, played on Feb. 4, 2007, pitted the Bears against the Indianapolis Colts. Hester, who is widely regarded as the best kick returner of all time, returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown. It marked the first time that this happened in Super Bowl history, and it has yet to happen since. Of course Devin Hester took the opening  
The Chicago Bears have been around for over 100 years and have naturally collected a number of titles in that extended timeframe. However, most of their success came from before the the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, meaning the Bears' Super Bowl story is a relatively short one given their trophycase. 
We take a look back at the Chicago Bears' Super Bowl history and even dive deep into the pre-Super Bowl era.  Year. Opponent. Score. 1921. Buffalo All-Americans. 10-7. 1932. Portsmouth Spartans  
On January 26, 1986, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Chicago Bears score a Super Bowl record number of points to defeat the New England Patriots, 46-10, and win their first championship since 1963. 
Super Bowl XLI was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Indianapolis Colts and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2006 season.

It's been 40 years since the Chicago Bears last emerged victorious in the Super Bowl. If the Bears want to end that drought, they'd do well to follow the blueprints laid by the two teams set to  
Under McCaskey's tenure, the Bears went to two Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl XX in 1986. Chicago won the NFC Championship and her father's namesake trophy against the New Orleans Saints in 2007  
Chicago Bears owner Virginia McCaskey has died at the age of 102. During her stewardship, the Bears won a Super Bowl in 1986 and lost a second 21 years later. 
"The Super Bowl Shuffle" is a song performed by the Chicago Bears football team (credited as the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew) in 1985. It was released in December 1985 on Chicago-based Red Label Records and distributed through Capitol Records [2] seven weeks ahead of their win in Super Bowl XX. 
Next Sunday, football fans will be gathering for the Super Bowl, and the Chicago Bears will be watching from the sidelines — again. The Bears haven’t played in a Super Bowl since 2007, a loss  
On Jan. 26, 1986, the Bears defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, capping one of the greatest seasons in NFL history. On the 35th anniversary, we look at some of the players on that team then and find out what they've been up to since becoming world cha
