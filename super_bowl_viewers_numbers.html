        <p>However, the final Nielsen numbers later revealed the game was watched by 51.3 million total viewers and received a 36.8 rating and a 68 share—less than Super Bowl I. [59] In New York City, the game received a 36.3 rating and a 61 share. 
The Super Bowl ratings record remains a 49.1 for 49ers-Bengals in 1982, but the viewership record was set just this year (2024) — 123.7 million for Chiefs-49ers. While Chiefs-49ers owns the largest official Super Bowl audience on record, that is only because Nielsen did not begin including out-of-home viewing in its viewership estimates until  
The Super Bowl has surpassed 100 million viewers every year since 2010, topping out at 126.3 million in 2017 and 123.7 million in 2024. The Most-Watched Super Bowls in History Super Bowl 
The 21.8 million number refers to Out Of Home (OOH) viewers who watched the Super Bowl LVI in bars, restaurants, and other venues, including viewing in other people’s homes. To make it easy to get the numbers right, I have compiled a chart with viewership stats from 2013-2024 of all the numbers reported by the broadcast networks. 
NEW YORK – February 13, 2024 – An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen. The broadcast averaged 120.3 million viewers on CBS alone, making it the largest audience for a single-network telecast to date. 
The Feb. 11 Super Bowl game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers brought in an average of 123.4 million viewers — the highest number of people watching the same broadcast  
It was the second straight year the Super Bowl averaged more than 100 million viewers after a period where four of the five games before 2023 had fallen short of that number because of cord-cutting. That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007. 
That out-rates last year’s big game—which held the record for the most-watched Super Bowl and second-most watched broadcast ever, at 115.1 million watchers—but fell short of the 150 million  
The audience for Super Bowl LVIII was so large that it approached the all-time most watched television broadcast in the United States set in 1969, when an estimated 125 to 150 million viewers  
The Super Bowl on Sunday drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers who watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in a nail-biting overtime triumph, CBS Sports said in a  
2025 Super Bowl Viewership Prediction Method. I decided to use a very simple method to predict the viewership numbers for the upcoming Super Bowl: the tried-and-true linear regression. 
Last year’s numbers were startling: An estimated 123.7 million viewers smashed the record set the previous year, and the number of people who watched at least a portion of the game also set a  
How many people watched the Super Bowl? 2024's Super Bowl had a viewership of over 123 million, making it the most watched TV telecast of all time.  NFL teams ranked by number of Super Bowl  
NFL Shop: Across NFL Shop sites in Europe, Canada and Mexico, total sales were up +39% year-on-year, compared to Super Bowl LVII. NFL Game Pass on DAZN: Viewership across Super Bowl LVIII week  
The Super Bowl averaged an impressive 113 million viewers on Sunday (Feb. 12), a one percent increase in comparison to last year’s big game and the broadcast’s greatest viewership in six years  
The most-watched Super Bowl of all time came in 2024. Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles had more than 123.7 million total average viewers. Streaming numbers from Paramount+ were added to the viewership numbers, which helped push the game past 123 million. 
The Kansas City Chiefs' last-second 38-35 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, one of the highest-scoring games in Super Bowl history, delivered massive viewership numbers, as well. 
For example, Super Bowl 58 had a Nielsen rating of 42.1 and a viewership total of 123 million. So 42% of American TV households were watching the Super Bowl and approximately 123 individuals  
58.9: TV rating (with a 77 share) for Super Bowl XXXIX among Jacksonville viewers, the highest recorded since Nielsen Media Research added the city in 1998. That was the third-highest rating  
The game was not close from the start. Despite the massive blowout, this was the fourth most-watched Super Bowl in history. The average viewership number for this Super Bowl was 112,752,000. The air date for Super Bowl XLVIII was on February 2, 2014. 3. Super Bowl XLIX: New England Patriots vs Seattle Seahawks. Super Bowl XLIX was aired on NBC. </p>
