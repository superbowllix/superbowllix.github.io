Green Bay had to wait 29 years for its next championship in Super Bowl XXXI. The Packers defeated the New England Patriots in 1997. They won their fourth Super Bowl in 2011, beating the Pittsburgh

The first half of Super Bowl I was competitive, as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards, 181–164, and kept pace with Green Bay by posting a 14–10 score at halftime. Early in the third quarter, Green Bay safety Willie Wood intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards to the 5-yard line. 
Green Bay has 13 championships, more than any other NFL franchise. Prior to the Super Bowl era, the Packers won titles in 1929, 1930 and 1931 by virtue of their regular-season finish and in 1936
