Miami was once QB U in the college game, but it hasn't cranked out any Super Bowl winning QBs, either. Just 26 colleges have produced a Super Bowl winning quarterback, and only five can brag about having multiple winners. 
This is a countdown of the 50 colleges that've been represented the most times in the NFL's ultimate championship, from 1967's Super Bowl I to 2022's big game, featuring former LSU teammates  
Louisiana Tech (Terry Bradshaw and Luke McCown) and Stanford University (Jim Plunket, John Elway) have also produced multiple Super Bowl quarterbacks. However, worth noting that there's no guaranteed route to making it to the Super Bowl, regardless of where you go to college. 
Despite their recent collegiate prowess, the Alabama Crimson Tide hasn't had a Super Bowl-winning QB since 1977. Recent 'Bama quarterbacks drafted into the NFL have fallen short of ultimate glory

There are five schools whose quarterbacks have gone on to earn their former schools two Super Bowl victories: BYU, Navy, Miami Ohio, Ole Miss, and Tennessee all lay claim to two NFL Championships. 
Big-name quarterbacks like Tua Tagovailoa, Trevor Lawrence, Dwayne Haskins, and Kyler Murray stole the show this season, but success at the collegiate level doesn't always translate to the NFL. INSIDER set out to determine which colleges produce the most Super Bowl starting quarterbacks and how many Super Bowl victories they have produced.

He was the MVP of the biggest game five times. Conclusion. That is quite an impressive list of stars, but like they say, ” The Cream rises to the top.” 
Ben Roethlisberger has won two Super Bowl rings with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the first at Super Bowl XL in 2006 and the second in Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. He also lost Super Bowl XLV in 2011. Ben was the quarterback of the Miami Redhawks while at Miami and is the career record holder for pass completions. The school has since retired his jersey 
Jim Kelly started four Super Bowls without winning any, a record. He's one of eight quarterbacks who have started at least four Super Bowls.

One university that has a strong track record of sending quarterbacks to the Super Bowl is the University of California, Berkeley (often referred to as Cal).
