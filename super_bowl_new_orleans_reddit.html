Jan. 11, 1970, Tulane Stadium: Kansas City 23, Minnesota 7. 1. New Orleans was supposed to get Super Bowl III, in which the New York Jets upset the Baltimore Colts, in part as a thank you to two  
In New Orleans, what’s a celebration without a parade? The Super Bowl Host Committee Parade in the French Quarter on Saturday, Feb. 8 showcases the city’s unique culture to the world. The parade will feature Super Bowl-themed floats from NFL partners, high school and college marching bands, and local dance groups.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Desiring a more local taste of Big Easy life during Super Bowl week? There’s plenty to explore both in and outside the city center. Streetcar lines roll to Uptown, Mid-City or City Park. A ferry crosses the Mississippi River to Algiers Point. 
NEW ORLEANS -- What can viewers expect from Kendrick Lamar 's highly anticipated Super Bowl halftime performance?So far, we know SZA will join him on stage, but more details could be revealed  
NOLA.com columnist Jeff Duncan provides a guide to help visitors navigate New Orleans during the week of Super Bowl LXI in February 2025. 
Bro no shit it’s very unlikely it would happen but you can’t deny though that it wouldn’t be cool to have a g59 Super Bowl 59 though and thats what I’m saying also lets stop acting like they haven’t sold out a lot recently with merch, concert prices, etc. 
Super producer Timbaland will bring his massive hits into New Orleans with the help of Maxim. Timbaland will perform at a special concert at the Maxim Saints &amp; Sinners Big Game Party on Saturday. The show will include performances from DJ Loud Luxury, Plastik Funk, DJ unKommon and former NFL player Le'Veon Bell. 
You do realize this’ll be the first Super Bowl for New Orleans in 12 years. And hell, Miami which is another city fans bitch the game is always hosted in; it’d had been a decade from Brees’ Saints winning it (XLIV) to the first Mahomes victory (LIV). It’s not that ”the nfl always goes to” schtick. 
As the countdown to Super Bowl LIX quickens, it is more than football fans whose excitement grows. New Orleans is a food destination.

They put super bowl cushions on the seats to take home alone with a bag of memorabilia. I still have my ticket from the game but I lost my seat cushion. I brought that shit to school every day for like a month in 7th grade. Getting to see the Patriots win their first super bowl my second season really watching football was fucking awesome. 
Next year‘s Super Bowl is in New Orleans. This was the first time they ever had it in Vegas and I think next year‘s price will be lower. Especially if the Chiefs are in it. In the beginning of the patriots runs to the Super Bowl, a lot of patriots fans were pulled to the game.

The Super Bowl has mainly been held in the South, California, and Florida. I understand the need for warm weather or domes, but it’s absolutely insane how the Super Bowl is held in about the same 4 or 5 locations every year. In fact, Miami, New Orleans, and the LA Area have hosted 60% of all Super Bowls. Super Bowls by city: Miami: 11 </p>
