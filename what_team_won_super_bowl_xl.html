For the Super Bowl that was played at the completion of the 2006 season, see Super Bowl XLI. Super Bowl XL Seattle Seahawks (1) (NFC) (13–3) Pittsburgh Steelers (6) (AFC) (11–5) 10 21 Head coach: Mike  
There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
Seattle Seahawks 10 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers 21 on February 5th, 2006 - Full team and player stats and box score 
The 40th Super Bowl was played on February 5, 2006, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. The Pittsburgh Steelers sought to win the franchise’s 5th Super Bowl. This was the first Super Bowl to be presented in HD. Super Bowl XL was one of the most controversial Super Bowl games due to some questionable play-calling during the game. The Lead-Up  
It features the Steelers beat the Seahawks, 21-10. Steelers receiver Hines Ward, who caught 5 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 18 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Pittsburgh finished the regular season with an 11-5 record and became the fourth wild card team, and third in nine years, to win the Super Bowl. 
Roethlisberger became the youngest starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl and finished 9-of-21 for 123 yards. Parker finished with a team-high 93 yards on 10 carries, while RB Jerome Bettis added 43 yards on 14 rushes.

The most noteworthy play for the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl was a horrid pass that Kelly Herndon of the Seahawks (15-4) returned a record 76 yards. 
Super Bowl XL was an American football game played at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan on February 5, 2006 between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Seattle Seahawks and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Pittsburgh Steelers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2005 season. In controversial fashion, the Steelers defeated the Seahawks 21–10

Host selection process Looking toward the stadium on the night of the Super Bowl. Ford Field was selected to host Super Bowl XL on November 1, 2000, at the owners meetings held in Atlanta, two years before the stadium opened in 2002; [7] the only previous Super Bowl held in the Detroit area, Super Bowl XVI, had been played at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1982 (also between teams from the AFC  
Though the goal for any team is to win the Super Bowl and hoist the Lombardi Trophy, the Seattle Seahawks were playing for individual hardware too in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
View the Box Score for the NFL football game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Pittsburgh Steelers on February 5, 2006. 
The Steelers earned their fifth title in Super Bowl XL against the Seahawks 
The Pittsburgh Steelers were Super Bowl champions for the fifth time in franchise history, and they won this one as a No. 6 seed in the AFC, by becoming the first team in NFL history to do it all on the road. The 2005 Steelers had done what Dan Rooney had told them to do in that meeting almost two weeks before _ they had made Super Bowl XL  
Stevens did too much talking in the weeks leading up to Super Bowl XL, making him a prime target for Steelers fans. As for Bettis, he hoped to retire after winning a Super Bowl in Detroit. The Steelers were technically the “home” team for this game, but they chose to wear their white jerseys because they had won three games to get here in them. 
With 58 Super Bowls currently in the books, NFC teams have won 29 Super Bowls. And AFC teams have won 29 Super Bowls. Aerial view of Dallas Cowboys QB Troy Aikman leading the offense during Super Bowl XXVIII. 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
The Seattle Seahawks lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-10 at Ford Field in Detroit. To this day (until the Lions host a wild-card game this January), it is the only playoff game played at that venue. Seattle’s hopes of their first Super Bowl win were dashed as the Steelers partied with their fifth Lombardi Trophy. 
After stumbling to a 7-5 start, the Steelers rebounded and entered Super Bowl XL finishing the regular season with an 11-5 record. (Although the team finished tied with the Cincinnati Bengals for the division lead, the Bengals won the tiebreaker for the AFC North championship based on better divisional record.) </p>
