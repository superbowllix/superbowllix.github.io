        <h2><strong>dallas cowboys super bowl wins by team super bowl performers through the years</strong></h2>
        <p>How many times have the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl? The Dallas Cowboys have won a total of 5 Super Bowls, in 1971, 1977, 1992-1993 and 1995. All of these Super Bowls happened while the team was in Dallas. 
The Dallas Cowboys won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXVII and XXVIII); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl XXIX champion San Francisco 49ers. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three titles in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super  
The Dallas Cowboys are a team with a rich Super Bowl history. With five Super Bowl wins, the team has the second-most Super Bowl wins in the history of the NFL. The Cowboys have made it to eight  
1996 Super Bowl (30): Dallas Cowboys 27, Pittsburgh Steelers 17 1997 Super Bowl (31): Green Bay Packers 35, New England Patriots 21 1998 Super Bowl (32): Denver Broncos 31, Green Bay Packers 24 
The Dallas Cowboys have been much more than an football team; they are a symbol of greatness and tradition. With several Super Bowl titles in their trophy case, they have forged one of the most successful and legendary stories. From the dominant teams of the 70s to the unstoppable offenses of the  
Another Super Bowl followed six years later before the Cowboys' dominance faded in 1982, and so started a nine-year stretch in which Dallas only reached the post-season twice. But as the 1980s came to an end, life under new owner Jerry Jones was about to begin, and under head coaches Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer, the Cowboys were crowned  
Dallas Cowboys All-Time Super Bowl Record The Cowboys are one of the winningest teams in NFL history, owning a 5-3 all-time record in the Super Bowl. They've won the title in each of their past three SB appearances, rattling off wins in 1992, 1993 and 1995. 
How many Super Bowls have the Cowboys won? Dallas has captured five Super Bowls in its franchise history, making it one of the most successful organizations since the merger.  Team: Wins: Most  
The Cowboys became the first team to win Super Bowls in consecutive seasons since the early 1990s 49ers. They faced the Bills who failed to avenge three straight Super Bowl losses. The game was played on January 30, 1994 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. 
The Dallas Cowboys have 5 wins in Super Bowls all-time. TEAM DATE W ROUND TM OPP RESULT TD 1DWN OFF OPP OFF 3DWN% 4DWN% 1 : Cowboys. 
Haley was instrumental in helping the 49ers win two Super Bowls, and the deal helped Dallas get over a playoff hump, winning three Super Bowls in the next four seasons after the addition of Haley. The Cowboys haven't made a blockbuster trade in quite some time, but could one similar to that of the Haley deal be the missing piece for Dallas? 
Dallas returned to the Super Bowl, following the 1978 season, losing to Pittsburgh 35–31. Bob Ryan, an NFL Films editor, dubbed the Cowboys "America's Team" following the Super Bowl loss, a nickname that has earned derision from non-Cowboys fans but has stuck through both good times and bad. [30] 
At the start of every NFL season, all 32 teams have the same goal: win the Super Bowl. While that goal is more realistic for some teams than others, every squad dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. 
The Dallas Cowboys won five Super Bowls with two starting quarterbacks:Super Bowl VI (1-16-72) -- Dallas 24, Miami Dolphins 3 [Roger Staubach, game MVP].Super Bowl XII (1-15-78) -- Dallas 27, Denver Broncos 10 [Staubach].Super Bowl XXVII (1-31-93) -- Dallas 52, Buffalo Bills17 [Troy Aikman, game MVP].Super Bowl XXVIII (1-30-94) -- Dallas 30, Buffalo 13 [Aikman].Super Bowl XXX (1-28-96  
The Dallas Cowboys’ Last Super Bowl Victory. Dallas became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years. During the 1995 season, they made history by beating the Steelers 27-17. The Super Bowl came after several key veterans left the team, including wide receiver Alvin Harper and safety James Washington. 
In the twenty-seventh Super Bowl, which was held at Rose Bowl Stadium California, the Dallas Cowboys made their most historically satisfying win against the AFC champions Buffalo Bills. Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, James Washington, etc all played their part most wonderfully to earn our American team their most amazing win of 52 to 17. 
The Packers won the first two Super Bowls (1966 and 1967) but had to wait 30 years for the next win, which came in Super Bowl XXXI. The team’s most recent Super Bowl victory capped off the 2010  
At the time of their fifth Super Bowl win in 1995, the Cowboys were tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the most Super Bowl titles in the NFL. However, Dallas has since been surpassed by teams below them on the all-time list. 
They would go on to win two more titles in the late 1970s, with victories in Super Bowl XIII (35-31 against the Cowboys) and Super Bowl XIV (31-19 against the Los Angeles Rams), solidifying their  
The Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers both have 5 Super Bowl wins but neither team has won since the mid-1990s. The 49ers reached the Super Bowl in 2012 and 2019 but lost to the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs in those contests. The Dallas Cowboys haven’t reached a Super Bowl since they won the title back in 1995. </p>
