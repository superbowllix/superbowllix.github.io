Notably, once the Super Bowl champion is determined, the trophy is sent back to Tiffany &amp; Co. for engraving before being delivered to the winning team to keep. All that said, understanding the making behind the Super Bowl trophy definitely adds to the allure of the award, especially considering the effort and detailing that goes into it.
