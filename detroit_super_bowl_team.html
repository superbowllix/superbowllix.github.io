        <p>The other two teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl (Cleveland and Detroit) both held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season. [n 7] Teams are listed below according to the length of their current Super Bowl droughts (as of the end of the 2024 season): 
In 2003, the team added black trim to their logo and jerseys. The facemasks on the helmet changed from blue to black with the introduction of the new color. In 2005, the team introduced an alternate black jersey. [10] [17] For 2008, the team dropped the black jersey in favor of a throwback uniform to commemorate the franchise's 75th anniversary. 
Detroit has never been to a Super Bowl. As a result, their streak is up to 57 years, with a chance to extend to 58 if the team can't take down San Francisco in the 2024 NFC championship game.

Their last appearance in an NFL championship game came in 1957 before the Super Bowl era got underway. How Many Super Bowls Have the Lions Won? Again, the Lions have never won a Super Bowl. However, Detroit has four pre-Super Bowl NFL Championships, with the last coming in 1957. They are one of 14 teams in NFL history to have won four or more  
Detroit Lions have never won the Super Bowl in the NFL, and are NFC's only team to never reach it. However, Lions are the Super Bowl 2025 favorite. 
Have the Detroit Lions Ever Won the Super Bowl? (The Lions fell short of an SB appearance in the 2023 season. Photo: Junfu Han-USA TODAY Sports) The Detroit Lions have never won the Super Bowl. They also have never played in the Super Bowl. Since 1970, Detroit has only appeared in the NFC Championship Game twice. 
The Detroit Lions have never won a Super Bowl. They have been in the NFL since 1930. This makes them one of the few teams without a Super Bowl win. They have four NFL championships before the Super Bowl started. These were in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. But, they have no Super Bowl wins. Understanding the Lions’ journey is key. 
Ever since the Super Bowl became the biggest stage in American sports in 1967, the Lions have not had the best history. However, change has come in Detroit and it warrants a deeper look. To begin  
NFL work crews, consisting of grounds keepers from numerous NFL teams, paint the Super Bowl logos onto Ford Field on Jan. 25, 2006.

In this edition of The First Read, Jeffri Chadiha surveys the entire 14-team playoff field, ranking them based on their likelihood to win Super Bowl LIX. Plus, a final top-five ranking in the MVP  
However, only one team can turn that dream into reality each year. Winning a Super Bowl is extremely difficult, as evidenced by the fact that over a third of the league’s teams have yet to win one. Let’s examine which teams have the most Super Bowl victories and revisit the final score of each game. 
As anticipation builds for Super Bowl 59, set to take place on February 9, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, fans are already eyeing tickets to witness the Detroit Lions potentially make history. With the Lions favored to represent the NFC in the big game, many are wondering just how much it will cost to be part of this monumental  
The 15-2 Detroit Lions are just the sixth team in NFL history to win at least 15 regular-season games and not win the Super Bowl. (Though it's worth nothing just two 15-game winners — the 1984  
Opening early in 2023, the Detroit Lions Super Bowl window has been opened and won’t close for a while. Here’s why I believe this franchise will be a top team for a long time. 
Of those 12 franchises, only two have appeared in four Super Bowls: the Bills and Vikings. The Falcons, Panthers, and Bengals each have two Super Bowl appearances as well. The Cardinals, Chargers, and Titans have all appeared in one Super Bowl. However, four teams have never even played in the Super Bowl: the Browns, Lions, Texans, and Jaguars. 
Now that the NFL playoff field is set, all eyes are on Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans. Fourteen teams still have their championship dreams alive, but only one will walk away with the Lombardi Trophy
