        <p>The Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams met for Super Bowl LVI, the most recent Lombardi Trophy battle, at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. It's not altogether surprising that these two teams made it (even if the Bengals' win over Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs was a bit of a surprise) considering they both feature star quarterbacks: Matt Stafford for L.A. (having finally been  
Either way, there have been several quarterback performances in Super Bowl history that are memorable for all the wrong reasons. 24/7 New York news stream: Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are 
These 10 quarterbacks, plus one honorable mention, played for exactly one winning team in the Super Bowl—and I think Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger owes his entire team a debt of gratitude. 
Trent Dilfer’s inclusion among of the worst quarterbacks in Super Bowl history is somewhat nuanced, as it wasn’t so much his poor performance in the Super Bowl itself, after all, his team won  
After Gannon, four quarterbacks sit at No. 2 on the list of most interceptions thrown in a Super Bowl: Kerry Collins (XXXV), Drew Bledsoe (XXXI), Jim Kelly (XXVI) and Craig Morton (XII) all threw  
Morton is one of the worst Super Bowl quarterbacks in history. In SB XII, he registered four completions and the same amount of interceptions without a touchdown. The Cowboys gave the Denver

A look at the five worst quarterback performances in Super Bowl history, including Denver Broncos legend John Elway. NFL.  5 best San Francisco 49ers teams of all-time. 3. Kerry Collins, New  
As bad as Eason’s day was, his passer rating still dwarfs Morton’s from Super Bowl XII. By completing zero passes while also throwing zero interceptions, Eason came away with a 39.6 passer rating. Which quarterbacks have been benched in the Super Bowl? Along with Eason and Morton, Earl Morrall was also sent to the bench in a Super Bowl. 
But this Super Bowl is also remembered for being one of the most unwatchable championship games in history and for the worst quarterback play by a winning starting quarterback in Super Bowl history. Second-year Pittsburgh quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger was terrible in the game, posting a 22.6 passer rating, the worst quarterback rating in  
Nick Foles etched his name in NFL history with his unfathomable run to Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl victory. Following an injury to MVP candidate Carson Wentz, Foles rose to prominence with the Philadelphia Eagles and guided them to victory in Super Bowl LII — earning Super Bowl MVP in the process after throwing for 373 yards and three touchdowns. 
But, the two-time First-Team All-Pro did not play well in the Super Bowl against Tampa Bay. 14. Matt Ryan. Rich Barnes - Imagn Images. Matt Ryan shouldn’t be on this list. Not because he doesn’t deserve it, but because he led a Super Bowl 28-3, only to see it slip away at the hands of Tom Brady. 
2007 New York Giants. The 2007 Giants, on paper, were very mediocre. They were 14th in points per game, 17th in points allowed, and had just a +22 point differential, which is the second worst for a Super Bowl-winning team in NFL history. 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
Quarterbacks Rich Gannon and Craig Morton had some of the worst passing games in Super Bowl history.  team. The Oakland Raiders QB tossed a Super Bowl record five interceptions against the  
To be fair, in that Super Bowl, he did not hurt his team much at all. 153 yards, one pass below 50% and no INT. Easy to win when your defense intercepts Kerry Collins 4 times, Ray Lewis alone forced 5 turnovers. 
Bradshaw threw for 300-plus yards in half his Super Bowls which, in the 1970s, was the quarterback equivalent of going to the moon (Super Bowl XII, in 1978, featured 217 total net passing yards). 
Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are the only starting quarterbacks to have won Super Bowls for two NFL teams, while Craig Morton and Kurt Warner are the only other quarterbacks to have started for a second team. Jim McMahon won a second Super Bowl ring having been a backup on the Brett Favre-led Green Bay Packers team that won Super Bowl XXXI.
