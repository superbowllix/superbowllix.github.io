        <p>However, only officials who have worked in the league for at least five seasons and have previously worked during the playoffs are eligible to officiate in a Super Bowl. A referee cannot work the Super Bowl at that position until she or he has been a referee for at least three seasons, while also meeting the five-year minimum service requirement. 
The NFL has released the officiating crew for Super Bowl LVIII, which is set to take place at Allegiant Stadium on Feb. 11.. The crew chief is Bill Vinovich, who has 18 years of experience in the

Five of the eight officials have Super Bowl experience: Cheffers (Super Bowl 55, 52); Ellison (53, 42); Bergman (53, 31); Hall (55, 53) and Paganelli (54, 47). Together, they have a combined  
Of the eight officials, five (Cheffers, Ellison, Bergman, Hall, Paganelli) have a combined decade of experience in the Super Bowl, as indicated by the numbers next to their names.

Carl Cheffers will be the Super Bowl referee for the third time in the past six years.  Josh Peter of USA Today noted Ellison has been disciplined twice by the NFL for using derogatory language  
The Super Bowl LIX matchup is officially set: the Philadelphia Eagles will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in New Orleans on Sunday, February 9. 
The NFL announced Tuesday its officiating crew for Super Bowl LIX, which is set for Sunday, Feb. 9 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The crew will be led by referee Ron Torbert, who is  
Though the participants for Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans won't be decided until Sunday, the officials were announced by the NFL on Tuesday. Ron Torbert will be the referee, taking on his second  
New Orleans may be tempting fate. Super Bowl 59 will be the first held in the city since 2013, when a power outage delayed the game for 34 minutes – the first and only time the nation's biggest  
Mike Pereira, a former veteran NFL official and the league's VP of officiating from 2004 to 2009, is surprised to see referees with less experience be selected for the biggest game of the season  
Fans stream into Caesars Superdome in 2025. As New Orleans prepares to host the Super Bowl at the arena, local officials are preparing for the possible presence of firearms in the nearby French Quarter. 
The first officials to call a Super Bowl with triple-digit jerseys were head linesman Dale Hamer (104), and back (now field) judge Dick Hantak (105), both in Super Bowl XVII. Hantak was the first official at there referee position with a three digit jersey to call at Super Bowl (XXVII). 
With the Kansas City Chiefs set to play for their third straight championship, the state of NFL officiating is under the microscope ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl. So much sp that commissioner Roger  
Super Bowl Sunday Forecast. Anyone wanting to warm up for the Super Bowl (and the gobs of food that will be consumed watching it) with a walk, hike, or a family game of touch football can expect sunny skies and a high of 56 on Sunday.

Kind of like this Super Bowl 59 hubbub around NFL referees and the Kansas City Chiefs. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell called it "ridiculous." Indeed, it doesn’t make sense for the NFL to  
The biggest football game of the year will take place when the NFL announces its officials for Super Bowl LVIII.
