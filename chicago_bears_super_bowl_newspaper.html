        <h2><strong>chicago bears super bowl newspaper super bowl ring error</strong></h2>
        <p>Next Sunday, football fans will be gathering for the Super Bowl, and the Chicago Bears will be watching from the sidelines — again. The Bears haven’t played in a Super Bowl since 2007, a loss  
The Chicago Bears aren’t playing in Super Bowl LIX. And if we’re being honest with ourselves, the Chicago Bears aren’t anywhere near playing in Super Bowl LX. Ben Johnson News  
"The Bears don't need much right now, but adding a veteran corner who has playoff and Super Bowl experience to play on the other side of Jaylon Johnson wouldn't be a bad idea," the authors said  
During her stewardship, the Bears won a Super Bowl in 1986 and lost a second 21 years later. McCaskey, the older of Halas’ two children, never expected to find herself in charge. Her brother, George “Mugs” Halas Jr., was being groomed to take over the team, but died suddenly of a heart attack in 1979. 
Here's what Super Bowl LVIII said about the Chicago Bears. 1. The Obvious  Copley News Service and has been a contributor for the Daily Herald, the Associated Press, Bear Report, CBS Sports.com  
Patrick Mahomes wills Chiefs to 38-35 Super Bowl win against Eagles - Chicago Sun-Times - One the most brilliant Super Bowl displays of quarterbacking prowess in league history — between  
Decades have since passed, and not only have the Bears not won another Super Bowl, but they’ve also struggled to achieve any form of sustained success. That can, and should, change in 2025. 
The Bears are one pass rusher, most of the offense and experience away from a Super Bowl. They have a kicking game, could use a better punt returner, but a dependable person fielding the ball can  
III: The Bears taped "The Super Bowl Shuffle" at the Park West in Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 3, hours after landing in Chicago following their only loss of the season, a 38-24 defeat on Monday Night Football in Miami. Walter Payton and Jim McMahon taped their portions later via a green screen in a racquetball court at Halas Hall. 
However, just because the Bears get one Super Bowl doesn’t automatically mean they’ll be in the rotation. Let’s keep that in mind. Ford Field (Detroit) and Lucas Oil Stadium (Indy) are new-era northern stadiums that have hosted just one Super Bowl. U.S. Bank Stadium (Minnesota) also fits, but it feels like that joint could enter the rotation. 
Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times Share NEW ORLEANS — The Sun-Times’ Bears experts pick the winner of Sunday’s Super Bowl between the Eagles and Chiefs (5:30 p.m., Fox 32): Chiefs, 31-28: Sorry to  
Take heart, Bears fans. Your team is in a 21-year cycle of recurring excellence — 1985, 2006, etc. Should it persist, you’ll be headed for New Orleans and Super Bowl LXII after the 2027 season. 
Lou talks Chiefs and Super Bowl history with Bears legend Tom Thayer Tom Thayer anchored the Bears' offensive line when they won Super Bowl XX. He caught with Lou Canellis before Super Bowl LIX  
In 1932, at age 8, she attended her first NFL championship game (in the pre-Super Bowl era), and the Bears won. They won it six more times before the Super Bowl was created. 
Chicago Bears owner Virginia McCaskey has died at the age of 102. During her stewardship, the Bears won a Super Bowl in 1986 and lost a second 21 years later. 
Virginia represented 13 family members in holding about 80% of the Bears. On the board of directors, she voted her family’s shares. How that voting bloc will be affected after her death is unclear.
