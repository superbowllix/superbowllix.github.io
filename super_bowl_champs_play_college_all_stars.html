        <p>The last game, a 24‑0 win by the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers in 1976, was played in a 'surreal' deluge.  When the College Football Stars Played NFL Champs; 
In 1976, 22-year-old Jackie Slater out of Jackson State played in a game that was known as the College All-Star Football Classic, where he and other college all-stars faced off against Joe Greene  
In the 42 College All-Star Games, the defending pro champions won 31, the All-Stars won nine, and two were ties, giving the collegians a .238 winning percentage. The second game, played in 1935, involved the hometown Chicago Bears , runner-up of the 1934 season , instead of the defending champion New York Giants .

Imagine getting the best of both worlds: college football, and the NFL, in one place! It might be hard to believe today, but back in the 1900s, 42 such games were played and even racked up millions in charity. The defending NFL champions would play against the best of the senior class of the previous year in an exhibition game for a noble cause. 
But there was a time when one of the major events of the American sports year was a game between the reigning NFL champions and a team of college all-stars. And it all came to an end 42 years ago today. Known as the Chicago Charities College All-Star Game, the contest was played every year from 1934 until 1976, with the exception of 1974, when  
What about a team of college All-Stars going against the defending Super Bowl champions?  College All-Star Game, the contest was played every year but one between 1934 and 1976, with 1974 being  
Beginning in 1934, the Chicago College All-Star game served as the preseason kickoff to each NFL season. Conceived by Arch Ward of The Chicago Tribune (who also developed major league baseball’s annual All-Star Game), it matched the previous season’s NFL champion against a squad composed of top college players, many of whom were about to enter the pro ranks (in 1935, the runner-up Chicago  
The Chicago Charities College All-Star Game was a preseason football tilt played annually (except 1974) from 1934 to 1976 between the National Football League champions and a team of star college seniors from the previous year. (There was one exception: The 1935 game involved the 1934 runner-up Chicago Bears instead of the champion New York  
In 1976 the Pittsburgh Steelers, Super Bowl X Champions, were beating the College All-Stars 24-0 with 1:22 left in the third quarter when the game was delayed after a torrential rainstorm hit  
One aspect of the College All-Star Game was later revived. The concept of the Super Bowl champion playing in the first game of the season was adopted in 2004 for the National Football League Kickoff game; in that game, the first game of the regular season is hosted by the league champion from the previous year. 
The first college all-star team to win was the 1937 squad. The college all-stars were led by future Hall of Famer Sammy Baugh, who threw the only touchdown pass of the game in a 6-0 victory over Curly Lambeau’s Green Bay Packers. The final game was played in 1976 against the Super Bowl X champion Pittsburgh Steelers. 
But back in the day, the NFL Champion/Super Bowl Champion would take on a College All-Star team in an exhibition game prior to the start of the next season. The game was called the Chicago College All-Star Game and it took place from 1934-1976 (with the exception of 1974, due to the NFL strike). 
I was looking at the SI article with the iconic pictures and it reminded me of the old practice that ended in 1976 where the Super Bowl Champs from the previous year took on a team of college all-stars in the summer during the preseason. 
The All-Stars were unable to generate meaningful offense as Tagge came under constant pressure and the running game was kept in check as well. On the last play of the first half, Chester Marcol of Hillsdale tried for a 68-yard field goal on a free kick that fell far short of the mark. The NFL champs took their ten-point lead into halftime.
