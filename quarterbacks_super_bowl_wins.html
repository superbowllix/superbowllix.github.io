Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
In his Super Bowl career, the six-time champion has the most starts (10) and wins (6) as a quarterback. He also holds the most career passing yards (2,838) and career passing touchdowns (18) in

A note on the rankings: the quarterbacks listed below are ranked by the Super Bowl wins and NFL Championships won as the starting quarterback for their teams. If one were to include wins as the backup quarterback, Steve Young, for example, would have three wins as opposed to the one he achieved as the starter. 
Super Bowl 54 (2019 season): 31-20 win over San Francisco 49ers; Super Bowl 55 (2020 season): 31-9 loss to Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Super Bowl 57 (2022 season): 38-35 win over Philadelphia Eagles  
The webpage lists the quarterbacks who have won Super Bowls for the Washington Redskins. 
Tom Brady’s seven Super Bowl wins are the most among any quarterbacks — and all players — in NFL history. Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana are both tied for second all-time among starting quarterbacks with four Super Bowl victories. With Brady’s retirement, Patrick Mahomes is the active leader for most Super Bowls among quarterbacks.
