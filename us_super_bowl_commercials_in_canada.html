        <p>But the fact remains: A 2019 CRTC decision means the commercials we see north of the border — the Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles game on Sunday in New Orleans will be broadcast in Canada  
Has Canada Ever Shown U.S. Super Bowl Commercials? Canadians were able to watch American commercials between 2016 and 2018. A Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) policy had banned broadcasters (such as CTV and TSN) from replacing U.S. ads with Canadian ones (also called simultaneous substitution or “simsub”). 
Here is everything you need to know about Super Bowl 58, including the top streaming option if you want to watch the US broadcast. WATCH: Super Bowl 58 in Canada and United Kingdom with DAZN 
Canadians have always wanted to see the famous Super Bowl commercials made for the audience south of the border. This pressure led to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) deciding in 2015 to end the practice of simultaneous substitution for the Super Bowl, effectively letting Canadians see the same stream as

Following a 2019 Supreme Court of Canada decision, Canadian ads will now be broadcast by Canadian channels and also shown on Super Bowl American broadcaster. American ads might also be aired on Canadian channels that hold the broadcasting rights as US companies can buy advertising time in Canada for this highly watched sporting event. For those  
For a few years, Canadians were able to enjoy the glossy, star-studded U.S. ads that have become a staple of the Super Bowl..

Super Bowl advertisers paid up to $8 million to secure a spot in television's most watched broadcast. Here's a lineup by product category of the commercials that will run. 
This commercial features actor Amrit Kaur and comedian Gerry Dee re-enacting Super Bowl commercials so everyone in Canada can get the full Super Bowl experience. Michelob ULTRA. 
Crypto ads dominated the Super Bowl scene last year, but much like the dot-com boom and bust at the dawn of the millennium, increasingly cautious cryptocurrency companies are backing away from big  
This Sunday, however, could be the last time Canadians will be able to watch the U.S. Super Bowl ads, because of Canada’s new trade deal with the United States. 
See you in court. Bell Media, which owns Canada’s Super Bowl-carrying network CTV, promptly went to court alleging the CRTC had overstepped its bounds with its 2016 decision and that it was  
Molson Coors is investing in a Canada-specific Super Bowl ad for the first time that features the “chill train.” The full spot dropped on Monday. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

The Super Bowl is one of the most watched television events annually, and Canadian advertisers want to soak up those sweet sweet ad dollars. Bell Media and the NFL signed an exclusive deal in 2013 to broadcast the Super Bowl in Canada, and they argued to the Supreme Court that the CRTC didn’t have the power to let American ads through. 
There is no better opportunity for advertisers than the Super Bowl, which is watched by an average of more than 100 million Americans each year. Naturally, the price of running a commercial during  
You could watch the 2024 Super Bowl in Canada with or without cable but couldn't see American Super Bowl commercials during the game.
