        <p>According to NBC Sports, “the Los Angeles Rams–who played home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at the time–played at the Rose Bowl in Super Bowl XIV (1980). A few years later, The  
Super Bowl LIX between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will be in the Caesars Superdome, home to the New Orleans Saints.The Big Game is coming to the Big Easy for the eighth time in  
In 1980 the Los Angeles Rams made it to the title game, but played Super Bowl XIV at the Rose Bowl instead of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The same thing would happen to the San Francisco  
The Kansas City Chiefs pulled it off against the San Francisco 49ers, 25 to 22, at home in Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024. 
A team has never played a Super Bowl game in their home stadium, but twice teams have played in their home area: In 1980, the Los Angeles Rams played in the Super Bowl in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, about 15 miles from their home stadium, and in 1985, the San Francisco 49ers played in Stanford Stadium, about 25 miles from their home stadium.

For the first 54 Super Bowls, it was true that teams had never played the game in their home stadiums. Then it happened two years in a row: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the first team to play in a Super Bowl in their home stadium for Super Bowl LV during the 2020-21 season. The Los Angeles Rams played at home for Super Bowl LVI in the 2021  
No Super Bowl team has played in their home stadium. The closest a Super Bowl team has been to playing at home was Super Bowl XIV when the Los Angeles Rams played the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California and Super Bowl XIX when the San Francisco 49ers played the Miami Dolphins at Stanford Stadium. 
Super Bowl matchups by year. Super Bowl 1: Green Bay Packers 35, Kansas City Chiefs 10; Super Bowl 2: Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14; Super Bowl 3: New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7 
Although no team other than the Buccaneers has officially won the Super Bowl in their home stadium, the 49ers were victorious in Super Bowl XIX in January 1985 at the Stanford Stadium, home of  
Ever wondered how a team is deemed the “home team” in a Super Bowl? The Super Bowl will not be played in their home stadium unless the stadium was already preselected. Super Bowl venues are usually selected 3 to 5 years before the event is due to take place, just take the Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas – the venue was picked in 2018. And  
Super Bowl XLVII [Wikimedia Commons / djanimal] It would be another seven years until the Super Bowl returned to the Superdome. Super Bowl XXXI was played on January 26, 1997 between the Green Bay Packers (35) and the New England Patriots (21). This victory is Packers quarterback Brett Favre's only Super Bowl win. 
The Philadelphia Eagles will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX.. The team's will meet up again after squaring off two seasons ago in Super Bowl LVII, with the Chiefs beating the  
The NFL playoffs have two teams left to battle for the Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl 59. The Philadelphia Eagles (17-3) and the Kansas City Chiefs (17-2) will meet in Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans  
The AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs were the home team in Super Bowl 58 last February, so as the NFC champions, the Philadelphia Eagles are the designated home team in Super Bowl 59 on February 9, 2025. This dates all the way back to Super Bowl I, in which the Green Bay Packers were the designated home team. 
Super Bowl LIX (59) will be played on Sunday, February 9 at 6:20 p.m. EST. The broadcast will be televised on FOX, with Kevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady as the announcers. 
The Eagles claimed the NFC's No. 2 seed with a 14-3 record, then won three straight home playoff games to reach the Super Bowl. 19. The two teams share history at the head coaching position  
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were the home team in Super Bowl LV – both figuratively and literally since the game was played at their home stadium, Raymond James Stadium – and chose to wear white  
Super Bowl 59 uniforms. Each year, the Super Bowl is played at a neutral site. The "home" team alternates yearly between the AFC and NFC champions. 
I think it would be a beautiful thing for a football team to go 15-1, hold a Super Bowl in its own city, kick the other team's ass, and then have the confetti come down at home. Equally devastating would be the loss at home, and doesn't make it the slightest bit more compelling than this neutral site shit? </p>
