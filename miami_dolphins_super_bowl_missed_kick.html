        <p>In Super Bowl VII Miami Dolphins K Garo Yepremian had his kick blocked by the Washington Redskins, and it just got worse from there for him. He fielded the b 
Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian's infamous missed field goal and failed pass attempt against the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII comes in as the No. 75 play in NFL history. 
He led the NFL with 117 points in 1971, [9] [10] and in Super Bowl VI, he scored the only three Dolphin points against the Dallas Cowboys. [11] The next year, he was a key member of the 1972 Miami Dolphins "Perfect Season" team — he was the leading scorer and converted on many clutch field goals to help the Dolphins stay unbeaten. [12] 
Super Bowl 17: The Dolphins trail the 49ers by 1 with 5 seconds left on the clock. Miami Kicker Ray Finkle from 26 yards out – misses. Wide Right. Only Finkle knows why he really missed that kick – Dan Marino held the ball laces in. Watch the video below for the rest of the story 
Garo Yepremian, the former NFL kicker who helped the Miami Dolphins win consecutive NFL championships but is best remembered for a Super Bowl blooper, died Friday of cancer. He was 70. 
Super Bowl XIX was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Miami Dolphins and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1984 season. 
In that season’s Super Bowl, the Dolphins fell short against the Cowboys, 24–3, Yepremian’s field goal marking Miami’s only points. The 1972 Dolphins were built in their coach’s image  
Yepremian could laugh about it later because the Dolphins ultimately won to complete the only perfect season in NFL history. Here are highlights from Super Bowl VII. Final score: Miami 14  
Place Kickers get no love from anybody, and when they screw up, nobody wears the goat horns higher. This brings us to Ray Finkle, who cost the Miami Dolphins the Super Bowl by missing what would have been the winning Field Goal by going “Wide Right”. His failure in the big game (which he blamed on D 
Super VII, the capstone to Miami's perfection, came a year after the Dolphins were trounced in Super Bowl VI by the Dallas Cowboys. The Dolphins reacted to losing the championship game after the  
Sunday in Gillette Stadium, Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard game-tying field goal that would have sent the Baltimore Ravens and New England Patriots to overtime, where the winner earned a spot in  
In one of the most painful field goal misses in NFL history, kicker Scott Norwood broke the hearts of Buffalo Bills fans with his gut-wrenching miss in the Super Bowl against the New York Giants. 
The Miami Dolphins have lost Super Bowl 17 in 1983 due to a missed field goal by fictional kicker Ray Finkle, which was held incorrectly by quarterback Dan Marino, who was still in college in  
In the 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, a key plot point involves a kicker for the Miami Dolphins named Ray Finkle; in the story, Finkle misses a field goal attempt in the closing moments of Super Bowl XVII, causing the Dolphins to lose the game by a single point–an obvious reference to Norwood's infamous kick in Super Bowl XXV. 
Ray Finkle, also known as "Lt. Lois Einhorn", is the main antagonist of the 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. He was the former popular kicker for the Miami Dolphins group, but was ultimately dismissed for costing the team a Super Bowl win. Finkle went completely insane, escaped from Shady Acres mental hospital, and had a sex reassignment surgery to escape the authorities. He read an  
This story has been corrected to say that Scott Norwood's kick in the 1991 Super Bowl came against  the ex-Miami Dolphins kicker who missed the game-winning field goal in the 1984 Super Bowl  
Miami Dolphins: 1967. A journeyman kicker who plied his trade across several teams in the 1960s, Booth Lusteg's time with the Miami Dolphins was short-lived but memorable. Known for his powerful leg and unorthodox kicking style, Lusteg brought excitement and flair to the Dolphins' special teams during his brief stint with the team. 
The NFL place-kicker might be the loneliest athlete in all of sports, especially after missing a an important field goal. Here's our list of the 20 most memorable failed field-goal attempts. 
Tight end Jonnu Smith and kicker Jason Sanders etched their names in the Dolphins record book. In his first season in Miami and with two games still to play, Smith has 76 catches and 802 yards – both franchise records for tight ends. 
The Miami Dolphins defense came up big in a much-needed victory at SoFi Stadium.  it didn't matter once Duke Riley recovered the onside kick to clinch the victory. So, the Dolphins moved to 3-6  </p>
