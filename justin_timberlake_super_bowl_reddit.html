        <p>This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018). I remember people being quite negative about him being picked in 2017 because it was assumed he and Janet were banned after the controversial 2004 performance - CBS officials would deny placing a ban on her. 
I feel like the target demographic that watches the Super Bowl doesn't dislike Taylor, though. Like the reasons people dislike her - fake feminism, Kanye controversy, too many boyfriends - just aren't things that most of America really cares about. Most of them probably don't even know about the Kim thing. 
This was Justin’s third appearance at the Super Bowl in less than 20 years (2001, 2004 and 2018).

Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after he tore off part of her clothing covering her breast at the end of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston, Texas, on the CBS television network, is notable for a moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast and nipple—adorned with a nipple  
MINNEAPOLIS — Justin Timberlake is headed here to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, stirring talk and fueling questions about one of the most scandalous moments in the history  
Justin Timberlake was already emerging as the most recognizable member of *NSYNC even before the band went on hiatus. As Bianca Gracie noted in an article for Billboard, his vocals typically featured on the hooks of the group's biggest hits, meaning he was the focus of the songs' catchiest moments. 
The field being set up for Timberlake's performance. In July 2017, Britney Spears was rumored to be the headliner, but Pepsi quickly denied it. During August and September 2017, several publications informed that Timberlake was the frontrunner to perform at the Super Bowl LII halftime, first along with his frequent-collaborator Jay-Z as co-headliner, and then as the solo performer.

Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson perform together at the Super Bowl in 2004. Getty Images Jackson appreciated that women these days are “comfortable in their skin, in their size, in being  
I heard this was basically a Leave Justin Alone piece and is it ever. “On February 1, 2004, the now-infamous “Nipplegate” incident occurred at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show as Janet Jackson performed with Justin Timberlake, crescendoing to a costume malfunction/reveal that begot the aforementioned name. 
Tom Brady is offering his thoughts on the 2004 Super Bowl halftime performance featuring Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake that remains a topic of debate to this day.. During the latest episode  
I mean, up to that point, the super bowl halftime show was a PG affair. Parents can't be on defcon alert 24/7 and watching TV at home just might be one of those instances when you lower your guard. Reply reply 
Lowe asked if Timberlake and Jackson “took some time to do that after the fact and kind of resolve the situation and were able to make peace of the whole thing.” Timberlake responded, "Absolutely," he said. "And I don't know that a lot of people know that. 
Another thing people forget is that Janet Jackson had been famous for at least eighteen years at at the time of the Super Bowl. She released Control in 1986 and the Super Bowl occurred in 2004. I remember her career being a little on the decline at this point. I never stopped letting Janet be a megastar. 
An older lady had invited us over to have a super bowl party and watch the game on her big screen. When that happened the youth pastor just covered his face with his hands and ran out of the room lol 
So Justin Timberlake was doing a performance and he went into the stands for a part of it. When he was in the isles doing dancing and stuff a kid brought out his phone and took a selfie with him. I think people are poking at the kid because he was either a bit awkward or he was on his phone and that's where the memes came in about it. 
Well, I dispute that "Justin Timberlake caused" it. It was just so incredibly obvious they planned it. Justin, Janet, and several MTV execs and choreographers all decided they were going to do that, and they made up a ridiculous story when the reaction they got wasn't what they expected. 
Timberlake gives an audible "woo!" to the audience. JT: How ya doin', y'all? Let's do this. Justin goes through a montaged series of his hits, including What Goes Around, Cry Me A River, SexyBack, etc. before going into Suit &amp; Tie. JT: Ladies and gentlemen put your hands together for mister Jay Z!!! 
Timberlake has never shown any signs of thinning/balding. There's slight recession of the hairline, but nothing that would be of concern. I mean, I'm sure there are plenty of celebrities on finasteride even purely for preventative measures so who really knows when it comes to anyone, but either way Timberlake is just born with great genetics. 
This was not new or scandalous to the super bowl. Janet already told us exactly what happened in her video statement the day after the incident. It was a choreographed moment accidentally gone wrong.
