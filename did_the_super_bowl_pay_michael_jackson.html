Here's how much Super Bowl halftime performers like Usher and Rihanna got paid for appearing in the show.  Beyoncé, Prince, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna. 
The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show took place on January 31, 1993, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, as part of Super Bowl XXVII. In an effort to increase its profile after being counterprogrammed by an In Living Color special the previous year, the show featured a performance by Michael Jackson. The performance was successful in its  
The efforts had failed three times with Michael even asking the NFL for a fee of $1million however the league did not pay performers.  Michael Jackson's Super Bowl halftime show that changed  
Super Bowl performers do not receive a single cent for their exploits. That's not to say the NFL leaves these musicians up a creek without a paddle. The league covers the costs for the theatrics. 
From Michael Jackson to JLo: Look back at every Super Bowl halftime performer Do Super Bowl halftime performers get paid? Despite the euphoria surrounding the event, entertainers do not get paid  
The first ever music artist to perform at the Super Bowl Halftime was Michael Jackson in 1993. He performed his greatest hits like ‘Billie Jean’ and ‘We Are the World’. After that, artists like Janet Jackson, Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, and others graced the stage at Halftime. 
Michael Jackson's halftime show is recognized as one of the best halftime shows in Super Bowl history. The league doesn't pay performers for the halftime show, but the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to  
Super Bowl 2024's halftime show featured Usher taking the stage, while some are wondering how much performers get paid for their work.  Prince, Madonna, Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. The  
Michael Jackson’s 1993 performance during Super Bowl XXVII is credited as the origin of the superstar-packed halftime show. Prior to his performance, the show was more about marching bands and card stunts, Billboard reported. The King of Pop set a high bar for this new halftime show format. 
MASTER entertainer Michael Jackson was a "nervous wreck" before his record-breaking Super Bowl performance 30 years ago - which was watched by billions, The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal. MJ was worried about how the crowd, mostly made up of NFL fans, would react to his pop-hit medley. 
Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson and the Rolling Stones haven't headlined a combined four Super Bowl halftime shows, but Up With People has. Something seems off there. Super Bowl XXV (1991) 
The show began with James Earl Jones’ voice introducing an “unprecedented Super Bowl spectacular starring Michael Jackson”. Then, four giant screens around the stadium showed Jackson’s silhouette, as he appeared to teleport from one screen to another, before finally emerging from the centre of the stage in a cloud of smoke and fireworks. 
That would be his longtime hero, Michael Jackson, who forever changed the halftime show — turning it into the biggest gig in music — when he put the “superstar” in the Super Bowl in 1993. 
The modern communal pop extravaganza known as the Super Bowl halftime show can trace its roots to Jan. 31, 1993, when Michael Jackson took the stage at the Rose Bowl for Super Bowl XXVII, where the Dallas Cowboys would trample the Buffalo Bills, 52-17.

Looking at Michael Jackson's 1993 halftime performance, it's got all the elements of a halftime show still employed today.

The modern communal pop extravaganza known as the Super Bowl halftime show can trace its roots to Jan. 31, 1993, when Michael Jackson took the stage at the Rose Bowl for Super Bowl XXVII, where  
That’s not much for the country’s top recording artists, but they almost had to settle for less lucrative deals: Ahead of Super Bowl XLIX, the NFL flirted with the idea of making the performers pay for the privilege of taking the stage, the Associated Press reported. 
The Super Bowl halftime show has been a marquee music event ever since Michael Jackson revolutionized the broadcast with an electric set that kept viewers glued to televisions around the country  </p>
