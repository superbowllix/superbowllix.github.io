        <p>[5] [6] In fact, the Super Bowl is the American sports broadcast with the most consistent ratings, [7] and draws substantially higher ratings than other sports events, including the NBA Finals and World Series. [8] Ratings for the Super Bowl first peaked from 1977 to 1987, when no less than 44.4% of American households with television sets  
The 2023 NBA Playoffs averaged a 2.7 rating and 5.12 million viewers across ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV, marking the highest average in five years (2018: 5.21M) and third-highest in a decade. After bottoming out at a 1.8 and 3.08 million in the fanless summer and fall “bubble” of 2020, playoff viewership has increased in three-straight years. 
In 2024, NBA Finals viewership was only a fraction of the number of viewers of the Super Bowl in the U.S.,  NBA Finals TV ratings in the U.S. 2002-2024; 
The NBA Finals air every year on ABC; Fox has the World Series rights on a long-term basis. The Super Bowl rotates between CBS, NBC and Fox. Due to a trade with NBC, CBS had the Super Bowl in both  
The highest rated and most watched NBA Finals series was the 1998 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz, which averaged an 18.7 rating / 33 share and 29.04 million viewers on NBC. That series also featured the highest rated and most watched NBA Finals game, as the Sunday night averaged a 22.3 rating / 38 share and 35.89 million  
Compare the Super Bowl to the entirety of the NBA Finals. Compare a Wild Card Round game to a first-round NBA matchup.  It would be more fair to compare the NBA Finals’ ratings to that of the

On the flip side, Game 3 of the Lakers-Heat NBA Finals in the fanless, months-delayed “bubble” ranks as the lowest rated and least-watched on record with a 3.1 rating and 6.08 million. That six-game series ranks at the bottom on average, with a 4.1 and 7.66 million. NBA Finals ratings, viewership. 2024: Celtics 2, Mavericks 0 
In the context of the current state of the television industry, Super Bowl LVII beat the NBA Finals' viewership by a significant margin. The former reportedly had 113.06 million viewers tuned in  
After a series-low in Game 4, the NBA Finals concluded with a four-year high in Game 5.. Monday’s Heat-Nuggets NBA Finals Game 5 averaged a 7.0 rating and 13.08 million viewers on ABC, edging Celtics-Warriors last year (7.0, 13.03M) as the most-watched Game 5 of the Finals in four years — since Warriors-Raptors in 2019 (18.60M). 
The 2021 NBA Finals were about as successful as a Milwaukee vs. Phoenix matchup in July could be, and grew 32% in total viewers from last year's series (when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the  
On ESPN's ‘Get Up’, Ryan Clark further explained that being the top seed doesn't guarantee progress in the NFL playoffs. He said: “Wildcard teams, number 7 or 8 seeds don’t win the NBA  
So it was no surprise that the Super Bowl averaged 113 million viewers this Sunday according to Nielsens TV ratings agency. However it was still astounding for me to see that all 6 NBA games of the 2022 finals combined (86.81 million viewers) would not even come close to a single Super Bowl viewership. 
The Super Bowl acts a the punctuation mark to the long NFL season. After the Super Bowl, the sports world is entertained by the NBA All-Star weekend. The hype continues to be matched with NBA playoff basketball as fans are blessed with the opportunity to watch their favorite players battle in heated series from March until June. After the NBA

The last normal Final for the NHL which was 2019 with the Bruins vs Blues, got a 3.0 rating, and of course as I said NBA got a 5.2 rating this year. What really shocked me is that Game 7 of the 2019 Cup, which was a 4.9, got better ratings than Game 1, Game 3, and Game 5 of this years NBA Finals. That alone is just crazy. 
Giannis Antetekounmpo’ s 50-point effort, which snapped the Milwaukee Bucks’ 50-year drought, posted a 50 percent increase in viewership over last year. Tuesday’s Suns-Bucks NBA Finals Game 6 averaged a 6.6 rating and 12.52 million viewers on ABC, up 57% in ratings and 50% in viewership from Lakers-Heat in the “bubble” last October, which aired opposite Sunday Night Football (4.2, 8  
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event of the year by a wide margin. People who haven’t watched a single NFL game all year will plan Super Bowl parties. That’s not to say that people consciously think ‘winning the Super Bowl is more impressive than winning the NBA Finals’. But way more people care about the former than the latter. 
In the final’s participating home nations, the match had 24 million viewers on French television’s TF1 and 12.07 million across three channels airing the match live in Argentina on TV Publica
