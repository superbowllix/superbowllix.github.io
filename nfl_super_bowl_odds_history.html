        <h2><strong>nfl super bowl odds history super bowl 2025 date las vegas</strong></h2>
        <p>The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of the NFL but also a cornerstone of the sports betting world. So, there is a lot to look into when it comes to Super Bowl betting odds history and betting trends. Betting on the NFL’s greatest Sunday matchup requires skill and some historical knowledge.

There are 12 NFL teams who have never won a Super Bowl: Arizona Cardinals; Atlanta Falcons; Buffalo Bills; Carolina Panthers  
The most infamous finale in Super Bowl history for oddsmakers was Super Bowl XIII and a lesson learned for all individuals standing behind the betting counter. The 13th installment saw the Steelers open as 4.5-point favorites over the Cowboys and the number dropped to 3.5 -points with early action on the Cowboys. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole.

Steelers: Super Bowl 10, 43 49ers: Super Bowl 23 Cowboys: Super Bowl 30 Patriots: Super Bowl 38, 39 Six times in Super Bowl history has a team won the game SU, but failed to cover the point spread. It first occurred in Super Bowl 10, when Terry Bradshaw and the Steelers beat the Cowboys 21-17, but failed to cover the 6.5-point spread. 
It is worth mentioning that the first Super Bowl had no over/under odds posted, but with 45 points scored, one would assume it would have gone over.
