        <p>During the same time frame, the Super Bowl scored 1,201 points. The Grey Cup has more scores than the Super Bowl – a Canadian win. The next question is, however, how points are calculated. Fans like to see high-scoring games, but they are more interested in touchdowns. In the last 25 Grey Cup games, 130 touchdowns have been scored. 
The Grey Cup is, of course, far older than the Super Bowl. This Sunday’s clash in Hamilton will mark the 108th time that teams have played for the CFL title — the first tilt taking place in 1909 between the University of Toronto Varsity Blues and the Parkdale Canoe Club. The Super Bowl, on the other hand, has only been around since 1967. 
In the same timeframe, 1,201 points were scored in the Super Bowl. The Grey Cup sees more points scored than the Super Bowl – a win for Canada. The next question, though, is how those points are scored. Fans want to see high-scoring games, but mostly want to see touchdowns. Over the last 25 Grey Cup games, 130 touchdowns have been scored. 
The Canadian Super Bowl, known as the Grey Cup, stands as the pinnacle of Canadian football. This championship game of the Canadian Football League (CFL) has been a cultural touchstone since 1909. While often compared to the NFL’s Super Bowl, the Grey Cup has its unique flavor that sets it apart in the world of North American sports. 
Regarding the Super Bowl, I felt this year's Grey Cup game was more exciting, actually. There was too much stop of play to debate whether someone had "control" of the ball or not. There's less of that nonsense in the CFL, because players actually have space to properly play the game. 
The NFL vs CFL Debate; A dip for the CFL? Regional and generational difference; More prefer Super Bowl to Grey Cup; The NFL vs CFL Debate. The NFL and CFL have competed for viewership for decades. This has led to innovations in the Canadian game, including feature games on Friday nights to avoid the Sunday head-to-head. 
Now when it comes to attending a Grey Cup versus a Super Bowl, the difference is as vast as the Pacific. You can’t deny the fact that the Super Bowl is not for the average fan. Anthony Beyrouti of Venue Kings – a Vancouver-based ticker broker firm – tells us that it will cost you $8,500 US just to get into Allegiant Stadium on Sunday to  
It's the fact that the Grey Cup brings with it century-old traditions, green-wearing fans with watermelons for hats, and the fact that you can find a horse from Calgary drinking at a local pub the days leading up to the big game - which is always held in the dead of the Canadian winter - that sets the governor general's contest above the marketing machine masquerading as a football game south  
A new poll from the Angus Reid Institute found that 70% of Saskatchewan and Manitoba residents would only watch the Grey Cup if given the choice between the Super Bowl or the Canadian championship  
The Grey Cup continues to be one of Canada's most-viewed sporting events. [129] The 1962 "Fog Bowl" game was the first Grey Cup to be broadcast on American television. [27] The CBC carried the first national telecasts exclusively, but the CTV Television Network purchased rights to the 1962 game. 
Cornerback Brandon Browner is the second double Super Bowl winner as he collected one Grey Cup ring and two Super Bowl rings. Browner was initially signed by the Denver Broncos in 2005. A forearm fracture saw him put on IR. So he headed North instead. He was with the Stamps from 2006-10. Between 2008-10 he was named a CFL All-Star three times. 
During the same time frame, the Super Bowl scored 1,201 points. The Grey Cup has more scores than the Super Bowl – a Canadian win. The next question is, however, how points are calculated. Fans like to see high-scoring games, but they are more interested in touchdowns. In the last 25 Grey Cup games, 130 touchdowns have been scored. 
The Baltimore Stallions were the only American team to appear in the Grey Cup (twice, losing in 1994 and winning the following year). Although the first Grey Cup game was in 1909, none were played from 1916 to 1919 or in 2020, thus the most recent final was the 111th Grey Cup game which was played on November 17, 2024, at BC Place in Vancouver. 
Today's 2024 Grey Cup live stream serves up the Canadian Football League's answer to the Super Bowl, with the Toronto Argonauts taking on the Winnipeg Blue Bombers at BC Place in Vancouver. 
In the final game of the CFL season, the Toronto Argonauts look to upset the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Grey Cup on Sunday at 6 p.m. ET (TSN/RDS, CFL+) from BC Place in Vancouver, B.C. 
Stallions linebacker O.J. Brigance would later win Super Bowl XXXV on January 28, 2001 as a member of the National Football League's Baltimore Ravens, becoming the only football player in history to ever win a Grey Cup and a Super Bowl with teams based out of the same city. This was the first Grey Cup to be played in the province of Saskatchewan. 
The Super Bowl may not be for another three months, but it's championship Sunday in Canada. LIVE: Updates, highlights from Blue Bombers vs. Alouettes The 110th Grey Cup is today, as the Montreal  
A decade ago, the Grey Cup drew more Canadian viewers than the Super Bowl. In 2005, New England’s victory over Philadelphia drew 3.1 million viewers to Global Television in Canada, down from 3.  
Here are my best free betting picks for the Grey Cup on TSN, with kickoff at 6 p.m. ET at BC Place in Vancouver on Sunday, November 17. Make sure to also check out Trevor Knapp's favorite Grey Cup  
Levy went 43-31-4 during his five-year tenure in Montreal and reached the CFL’s version of the Super Bowl three times, twice winning the Grey Cup and losing his shot at a third by the same one-point margin the New York Giants would beat his Bills by in the first of those four Super Bowl defeats. </p>
