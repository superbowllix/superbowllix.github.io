        <p>The NFL Super Bowl and UEFA Champions League final are two of the most-watched games on TV. Over 123.7 million viewers watched the Super Bowl in 2024, making it the largest TV audience to date. 
The 2024 UEFA Champions League final brings the curtain down on European club football before attention turns to Euro 2024 in Germany and  That's more than 12 times the viewership of Super Bowl 58. 
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe, but one towers over the other due to the availability of a larger global audience. 
What Has More Viewers: Super Bowl or Champions League Final? Champions League final vs. Super Bowl viewership reaches into the hundreds of millions, easily, for both games! Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, which ended as a 25-22 overtime win for the Chiefs, was the most-watched telecast in US history. 
The UEFA Champions League final and the Super Bowl are two of the most-watched sporting events around the globe. Both the NFL and UEFA have built their versions of football into global powerhouses, and fans have responded in droves, with viewership numbers increasing rapidly across the world. 
This figure beats every other sporting event: the '24 NBA Finals averaged 12 million, the '23 UEFA Champions League final attracted 450 million viewers, and the '24 Super Bowl had 173 million (123 million in the United States). 
It's like when Australians wheel out the statistic that the AFL Grand Final is one of the most attended sporting events in the world, well yeah, it is, because the AFL Grand Final is always played at a ground that holds over 100,000 people. And there's only a handful of other sporting venues in the world that can boast that kind of attendance. Der. 
The Super Bowl stands as a cultural phenomenon in the United States, while the Champions League final is established as a spectacle of truly global reach. Both events demonstrate the power of sport to bring together people from different cultures and nationalities, albeit with distinct focuses and geographical scopes. 
That garnered 26.73m average viewers, but even that amounts to less than the lowest-viewed Super Bowl ever, Super Bowl II, which drew an audience of 39.1m in 1968. The NFL has mastered the art of monetizing the Super Bowl, with the half-time commercials having become almost as big a part of the spectacle as the action on the field. 
The sadness in this AS piece is that a Champions League final ad draws very little money compared to a SuperBowl ad, for a number of reasons. For once, the US audience is wealthier on average than that of Champions League viewers. But also, there are very few - if any - legacy teams in the NFL. 
The 2024 UEFA Champions League final brings the curtain down on European club football before attention turns to Euro 2024 in Germany and  That's more than 12 times the viewership of Super Bowl 58. 
Take last year’s Super Bowl versus the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar. The 2023 Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles set a domestic viewership record with 115.1  
The 2024 UEFA Champions League final brings the curtain down on European club football before attention turns to Euro 2024 in Germany and  That's more than 12 times the viewership of Super Bowl 58. 
The Super Bowl versus the FIFA World Cup: two colossal events that captivate the globe, each with its own fervent following. In this video, we dive deep into 
The 2024 UEFA Champions League final brings the curtain down on European club football before attention turns to Euro 2024 in Germany and  That's more than 12 times the viewership of Super Bowl 58. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
However, there’s another annual sporting event that competes with the Champions League Final in terms of popularity and revenue: the US’s Super Bowl Sunday, which concludes the NFL season. Back in 2015, the Super Bowl brought in 114 million viewers compared to the Champions League Final’s 380 million, according to Infographics. 
However, the Super Bowl viewership is dwarfed in comparison to the UEFA Champions League final in general. According to reports, the UCL final generally attracts between 380 million to 400 million
