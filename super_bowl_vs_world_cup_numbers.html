        <h2><strong>super bowl vs world cup numbers bears vs colts super bowl quarterbacks</strong></h2>
        <p>The massive viewership numbers of the World Cup and Super Bowl pad the coffers of FIFA and the NFL respectively. FIFA has turned a profit of nearly $5 billion or more from the last three World Cups. 
The 2022 Super Bowl pales in comparison, having had an average TV viewership of 99.2 million on NBC plus an estimated 30 to 50 million viewers around the world. Felix Richter 
Super Bowl vs World Cup. As you can see, the numbers don’t lie when comparing the Super Bowl with the World Cup. If you want to compare football and soccer domestically, we have an NFL vs MLS article that may interest you. Also, here is one more look at the facts and figures comparing the Super Bowl with the World Cup. 
The Super Bowl isn’t going to become the most-watched sporting event on Earth, and the FIFA World Cup — nor anything else — is likely going to oust the NFL title game from its domestic throne. 
The Super Bowl pulls in larger sums of TV advertising revenue than the World Cup, and there are a number of reasons attributed to this. For one thing, the United States is one of the biggest advertising markets in the world, so its advertising revenues would of course be significantly higher. 
Both the Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup have established themselves as iconic events with rich legacies that go beyond just the games themselves. The Super Bowl, which began in 1967, has grown into a cultural juggernaut in the United States. Over the years, it has become synonymous with American sports excellence and spectacle. 
The disciplines also have two of the most popular competitions. Dig in for a complete Super Bowl vs World Cup Finals comparison, focusing on fan participation, viewership, and revenue generated.

The World Cup final is an unbeatable global behemoth and that’s the problem when comparing the men’s World Cup final with the Super Bowl. You simply cannot get past the numbers. 
The World Cup champions unarguably make more money than the Super Bowl winners, as FIFA is known to be one of- if not the most- powerful entities in the world with a total worth of $1.52 billion. 
How does ticket data compare in the World Cup vs. Super Bowl? Tickets to Super Bowl LVI in SoFi Stadium ranged from $6,800 for the lowest price on Ticketmaster to up to $81,800 for VIP seats. To attend a World Cup game in Qatar could cost you somewhere between $11 to $1,067, with the final on Dec. 18 likely raising the numbers. 
The 59th Super Bowl (Super Bowl LIX) kicks off this weekend, February 9, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, USA, in a clash between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs that is not only the height of American football but also a worldwide spectacle combining business, entertainment, and competition. 
Recommended Reading. In 2018, the FIFA World Cup garnered more than 35 billion viewers, with 1.12 billion tuning in for the final match.Compare that to the most-viewed Super Bowl, which was the 2015 matchup between the Seahawks and Patriots (114.4 million viewers). 
While the World Cup obviously gets more viewers, it is, again, not easy to compare the two events without multiplying the Super Bowl numbers by four. We can only imagine what the Super Bowl would  
Sport Super Bowl vs World Cup: The Record-Breaking Numbers and Social Media’s Reaction. Record-breaking viewership numbers, incredible sporting merit and unlimited entertainment value – the Super Bowl and the World Cup Final had it all. 
It's going to be easy to beat for the US in the 2031 world cup, I mean they first got knocked out from getting a direct space against a team that only went professional a season or two ago, Chile. Then they got knocked out by a team in the final qualification tournament of which most players play in the third tier of French rugby with exception  
The soccer finale, as per FIFA, had fetched around 1.5 billion views worldwide. Now that’s a mind-boggling number if there ever was. However, due to all the high octane passion, action and emotion in the NFL finale, many fans are opining that Super Bowl might have also fetched similar amount of views. 
Is The Super Bowl Losing Popularity? The Super Bowl is undoubtedly the most watched broadcast in the US year after year. According to the NFL, the highest Super Bowl viewership in NFL history was Super Bowl LVII in 2023, with 115 million views. The last time the NFL saw numbers like that was Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 with 114 million viewers.
