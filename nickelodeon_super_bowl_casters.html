        <p>The following is a list of Super Bowl broadcasters, encompassing all national American television and radio networks, as well as sports announcers who have covered the first four AFL-NFL World Championship Games and subsequent championship games of the National Football League.

[21] In August 2024, CBS announced that Nickelodeon would carry another Wild Card game during the 2024–25 NFL playoffs. [22] 
For Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014, Nickelodeon produced a string of programming across its networks. This included a special edition of TeenNick Top 10, hosted by Nick Cannon and featuring an interview with then New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz, an episode of the animated series NFL Rush Zone that featured J. J. Watt of the Houston Texans and Vernon Davis of the San Francisco 49ers, and  
There will be two broadcasts of Super Bowl 58 between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs for fans to watch. The traditional NFL broadcast with Jim Nantz and Tony Romo on CBS. 
Time will tell if the Nickelodeon broadcast on Sunday will be a hit, but if it is they likely won't be able to run it again in 2025. Fox owns the broadcasting rights for the 2025 Super Bowl and does not fall under the Paramount tree like CBS and Nickelodeon do. 
But using last year’s record 115.1M Super Bowl viewers on Fox as a benchmark, Nickelodeon’s reach is bound to grow. Particularly given the networks’ multiplatform promotional strategy that included a weeks-long, Nickelodeon and NFL-themed campaign on Roblox to funnel younger viewers to the alt-cast. 
For the first time in NFL history, the Super Bowl will feature an alternate telecast. The NFL announced on Tuesday that a kids-focused Super Bowl broadcast will air on Nickelodeon in 2024. Super Bowl 58 is scheduled to be played in Paradise, Nevada, on Feb. 11, 2024.

CBS Sports and Nickelodeon are taking things to the next level with their NFL coverage. After their Emmy Award-winning coverage of the NFL wild-card round, the slime is headed to Super Bowl LVIII  
This season’s NFL Wild Card telecast on Nickelodeon will mark CBS Sports’ and Nickelodeon’s sixth family-friendly collaboration on an NFL game – and third NFL Wild Card game. It follows up Super Bowl LVIII Live from Bikini Bottom, the historic Sports Emmy Award-winning alternate telecast of the Super Bowl, which was the first of its kind. 
The popular Nickelodeon broadcast of NFL holiday games will be heading to Allegiant Stadium for Super Bowl 58 between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs. 
Super Bowl LVIII will be given the Nickelodeon treatment for the first time ever, with a unique telecast on the children's network aimed at young NFL fans. With superstars Patrick Mahomes and Brock Purdy set to face off in Las Vegas, some familiar animated characters will instead be the stars of the show in this pioneering alternative broadcast. 
We have reached Super Bowl 58, with the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs playing for the championship. It’s CBS’ turn in the Super Bowl rotation to broadcast the game. As you would expect, CBS is going all out with an expanded pregame show, additional reporters for the game, and an alternate broadcast for kids on Nickelodeon.
