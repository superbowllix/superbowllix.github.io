        <p>The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl championships all-time with six each. The Patriots won their first in 2002 (Super Bowl 36) and their most recent in 2019 (Super Bowl 53). The Steelers won their first Super Bowl in 1975 (Super Bowl 9) and their most recent came in 2009 (Super Bowl 43). 
For OVER/UNDER bets, a total point threshold is set, such as the 49.5 total point mark for Super Bowl LIX. Bettors predict whether the combined score of both teams will be OVER or UNDER this number. The UNDER has hit in five of the last six Super Bowls. 
Taking out two pushes and one pick ’em game, favorites are 28-27 (51%) in the game against the spread. The over/under is split exactly down the middle with 29 games going over the total and 29 staying under (Super Bowl I had no over/under odds posted, but one would have to assume it would have gone over with 45 points scored). 
Favorites are 28-28-2 in the 58 Super Bowls that have been contested. The UNDER is 29-28 in Super Bowl betting history. There was no total posted for Super Bowl 1. This year's Big Game will be a

The ‘over/under’ has gone 29-28 in the first 58 Super Bowl matchups. No total was posted on Super Bowl I between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. In the 2019 Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. 
The Super Bowl odds of the past are quite reflective of football history as a whole. The low totals in the early years were true to a lower-scoring era, while the tremendous spreads of the first few games are indicative of the major gap between the NFL and fledgling AFL that had to be overcome in order to create the modern league. 
Largest Over/Under Differential. Super Bowl 53: Patriots vs. Rams Record: 39.5 points Tom Brady won his sixth ring was a low-scoring affair. Patriots vs. Rams closed at 55.5, the third-highest over/under in Super Bowl history. 
The Bills and the Vikings are the only teams in Super Bowl history to go 0-4 against the spread. In the 2019 Super Bowl, Star quarterback Tom Brady and the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a margin of 13-3 – and the combined 16 points was the lowest ‘over/under’ result in Super Bowl history. The three points by the  
Super Bowl Over Under History. The Super Bowl over-under has gone an even 27-27 over the years. This is both a testament to just how good Vegas is at picking these numbers and how evenly matched the majority of Super Bowls have been over the years. The first Super Bowl did not have an over-under, hence there being records of just 54 Super Bowls  
Since a run of 12 consecutive totals under 40 from Super Bowl IV to Super Bowl XV, the Super Bowl over/under has been below 40 only four times in over four decades.

More people than ever are expected to bet a record amount on this year’s Super Bowl,  The over/under for the Super Bowl is actually lower than the 49ers’ two previous playoff games and the  
For instance, star Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter is getting an Over/Under Super Bowl sack number of 0.25. Over 0.25 sacks is priced at +121 for Carter. Under 0.25 sacks is -152. 
For a third straight year, I'm betting the over in the Super Bowl as the total goes just over this number into the low 50s with so much firepower offensively on each sideline. Chiefs vs. Eagles
