        <h2><strong>super bowl quarterbacks by college massachusetts super bowl matchups</strong></h2>
        <p>Dawson was 1–0 in an AFL Championship game played before the NFL and AFL first met in the Super Bowl. Three pairs of quarterbacks faced off twice in the Super Bowl: Staubach and Bradshaw, Aikman and Kelly, and Brady and Eli Manning. In each case the same quarterback (Bradshaw, Aikman, and Manning) won both games. 
Super Bowl titles: 2 Finishing his career with a long list of NFL records, the former Vols star picked up two Super Bowl championships, first in XLI after the 2006 season with the Colts and  
How many Super Bowl winning starting quarterbacks has your school produced? How many wins can they each brag about? That's going to mean something different in the near future with all the transfers and movements in the college game - Wisconsin gets credit for Russell Wilson, not NC State, and of course UCLA can claim Troy Aikman, not Oklahoma - but it's all fairly obvious. 
Top college football programs don't always create Super Bowl-level quarterback talent.; The Cal Golden Bears have produced five Super Bowl-starting quarterbacks — the most of any school. 
Let’s take a look at the six Super Bowl games started by Cal alumni quarterbacks: Joe Kapp, Minnesota Vikings, Super Bowl IV, January 11, 1970. Final score: Chiefs 23, Vikings 7

Former Boston College Eagles quarterback Matt Ryan didn't just appear on a Super Bowl roster; he led the Atlanta Falcons to 2017's Super Bowl LI. SLIDE 19 of 50 32 (TIE). 
Louisiana Tech (Terry Bradshaw and Luke McCown) and Stanford University (Jim Plunket, John Elway) have also produced multiple Super Bowl quarterbacks. However, worth noting that there's no guaranteed route to making it to the Super Bowl, regardless of where you go to college. 
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is also the first to represent his college — the University of Oklahoma — at the Super Bowl. Hurts spent his senior season with the Sooners after  
Despite their recent collegiate prowess, the Alabama Crimson Tide hasn't had a Super Bowl-winning QB since 1977. Recent 'Bama quarterbacks drafted into the NFL have fallen short of ultimate glory  
Ben Roethlisberger has won two Super Bowl rings with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the first at Super Bowl XL in 2006 and the second in Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. He also lost Super Bowl XLV in 2011. Ben was the quarterback of the Miami Redhawks while at Miami and is the career record holder for pass completions. The school has since retired his jersey 
Joe Theismann is the only other former Notre Dame quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl, leading the Washington Redskins to a 27-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins in the 17th big game. 
Elway and the Broncos were beaten up again in Super Bowl XII by another NFC East team; this time, it was MVP Doug Williams and his Washington teammates smashing Denver 42-10 to get on the list of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks. Williams was the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
When Hurts takes the field for Philadelphia in Super Bowl 59 against the Chiefs, he'll become just the fifth quarterback in NFL history to reach two Super Bowls before age 27. Hurts' success, on  
Super Bowl LIX will be the ultimate test for both quarterbacks. Mahomes is chasing history, looking to close the gap on Tom Brady ’s 35 career playoff wins, while Hurts aims to cement his legacy  
With Super Bowl LIX fast approaching, let's take a look at which quarterbacks have managed to win both the NFL title and the National Championship in the NCAA. A new edition of the Super Bowl is  
One of the most famous examples is Roger Staubach, who won the Heisman in 1963 while playing for Navy. He later led the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowl victories, earning MVP honors in Super Bowl VI. 
Allen’s 101.5 career passer rating in the playoffs ranks fourth best among the 74 quarterbacks with at least six playoff starts in the Super Bowl era, trailing only Super Bowl winners Mahomes (105.6), Kurt Warner (102.8) and Matthew Stafford (102.3). 
Since 1987, only 15 QBs have started for the AFC in the Super Bowl compared to 30 for the NFC. 38 total Super Bowls in that timespan. upvotes · comments 
HOFers Named Super Bowl MVP 23 members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame have earned Most Valuable Player honors in a Super Bowl. Three of them -- Bart Starr (2), Terry Bradshaw (2), and Joe Montana (3) -- have earned the award more than once. </p>
