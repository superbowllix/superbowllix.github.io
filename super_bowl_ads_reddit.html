        <p>Join the discussion of the commercials from Super Bowl LVII on Reddit. See the list of ads, watch the videos, and read the comments from other viewers. 
Robert F. Kennedy Super Bowl LVIII Advertisement Commercial Ad American Values. In e.l.f we Trust | e.l.f Cosmetics Game Day Commercial 2024. Robert Kraft Call with Dr. Clarence Jones: Super Bowl Commercial. Gift Mode: Etsy’s 2024 Big Game Commercial. Paramount+ Super Bowl Spot | Sir Patrick Stewart Throws a Hail Arnold | A Mountain of  
The NFL gives teams $4,000 for each Super Bowl ring, and team owners spend their own money to improve them. The rings Chicago Bears players received from the McCaskey family for Super Bowl XX cost $4,000. 
25. Nationwide Insurance — 'Boy' Super Bowl: 46 (Feb. 5, 2012) This is the most controversial one on the list, not because of its humor — because there isn't any — but because of its pure  
Let’s dig in. The all about the eyeballs ad. More than 123 million people watched the Super Bowl in 2024, in the U.S. alone. The four games during NFL Divisional weekend this year averaged 36.6  
No, it wasn’t a glitch — for some Super Bowl viewers, a Reddit commercial really did pop up on the screen.. The spot, which was just five seconds, opened as if it were a car commercial, but  
The Kellogg School Super Bowl Advertising Review, an annual ranking from Northwestern University’s business school, reported shortly after the game on Sunday that Reddit’s commercial was among  
Tide went meta when it bought an ad in every quarter of the 2018 Super Bowl. Each spot riffed a stereotypical Big Game commercial: a car ad, a beer ad, a deodorant ad, and more. 
The use of celebrities in a Super Bowl commercial doesn't get any better than Betty White getting laid out trying to catch a slant over the middle of the field. Snickers has done multiple  
The truncated commercial is probably the shortest to air this Super Bowl season, but its impact is undeniable. Kicking off with a pair of racing SUVs, the ad cuts to a screen with Reddit's  
2.9K subscribers in the SuperBowl_Commercials community. This is a subreddit for commercials played during the yearly American Football Championship 
Super Bowl commercials are stupid, too overhyped and they are just simply regular tv commercials with bigger bells and whistles! Not worth any hype. I know a ton of posts on this sub are actually semi popular posts and constantly get critiqued for being such. 
Hello! I'm back again. 30 seconds ads have gone up to about 5.6M per spot Trailers will be in bold. Any extended/full versions of the videos will be the ones linked. Not including ads for shows on the same network (FOX), local ads, or political ads. If I miss any let me know! Previous threads: 2019 | 2018 | 2017 
I'm going to be grading every commercial as it goes, break by break. I'll update this comment with all of my ratings, and I'll also try to link to every commercial on youtube later. Grades are my personal opinion, and may change over the course of the night. Will be commenting in the main threads, and editing them onto this one. Cheers! 
But while they slashed their ad budgets during the Great Depression, Coke doubled down, and now most people don’t even know Moxie existed while Coke is one of the biggest brands on Earth. People won’t support what you’re doing if they don’t know about it. 
We also hate commercials, it's just typically the Super Bowl has better commercials than average. They cost a ton of money, like over 1 million to air once during the game, so they are usually funnier or have higher production value than regular ads. 
Super Bowl ads are subject to the same rules of effectiveness as all ads: People can’t remember the ad without remembering the brand. People can’t describe the ad to a friend without repeating the message it conveyed. SB ads miss #1 because they try to hard to impress, and miss #2 because there wasn’t a clear message in the brief. 
The study design isn't assessing the correct data to come to the very broad conclusion that '80% of Super Bowl ads don't help sales'. Most of the Super Bowl ads I have seen have just been about brand building anyway, and the effect of brand building on consumer behaviour is only seen at its strongest in the long term, which this study isn't  
The Super Bowl is one of the most American events of the year. Not enough people are talking about how weird it is that Temu was even allowed to have not one but two commercials Reply reply More replies 
I liked Larry David’s reluctance to new ideas a lot “I HAVE TEN FORKS RIGHT HERE!” And the NFL commercial where the video games characters came out. Lays with Seth and Paul was decent. I think the Super Bowl spots being the golden standard for commercials is no longer a thing. They’ve been flat for years now. Often just a few good ones. </p>
