        <h2><strong>most unexpected super bowl wins super bowl watch party 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>It is not surprising to anyone that the New England Patriots are once again in the Super Bowl . The Giants weren't expected to be in the Super Bowl, but it will not be a surprise if they win 
Just making it to the Super Bowl would have been an amazing story, but they took it even further. They upset the St. Louis Rams 20-17. St Louis were one of the biggest favorites in Super Bowl history. 
Cincinnati did that in spades to become the most unexpected Super Bowl team ever. Bengals AFC Champions gear now available The Bengals are going to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1989. 
This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos). 
It was the first of six Super Bowl wins for the Brady/Bill Belichick-led Patriots. 3. 1981 49ers Bill Walsh’s team became the first squad in NFL history to win the Super Bowl after having the league’s worst record two years earlier. A 6-10 outfit in 1980, the 49ers started the season 1-2 before finishing with a 13-3 regular-season record. 
The Most Surprising Super Bowl Wins of the 21st Century: The Super Bowl is the biggest event of the NFL season, and it's played between two equally matched teams. However, sometimes the game is too close to call - and some wins have surprised players and spectators alike. 
Super Bowl I took place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on January 15, 1967 between the Chiefs and Packers which Green Bay won, 35-10. Packers receiver Max McGee scored the first ever TD in a  
Normally, the preseason Super Bowl odds provided by sportsbooks like Betway can be used as an excellent indicator of who will make it to Super Sunday. The Chiefs, 49ers, and Eagles have all delivered as betting favorites in recent seasons, while the 2024 campaign was dominated by the expected likes of the Detroit Lions, as well as Kansas City and Philadelphia once more. 
The Kansas City Chiefs are facing the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans (6:30 p.m. ET, Fox). The game features big-name stat-stuffers like quarterback  
The 49ers, seeking their third championship of the 1980s under coach Bill Walsh, had an 80% win probability when Super Bowl XXIII kicked off, but the opposing Bengals had league MVP Boomer Esiason  
Coming off a 5-11 season, the Patriots didn’t appear to be playoff contenders, let alone threats to win the Super Bowl. But during the second game of the season, quarterback Drew Bledsoe got hurt. 
That Super Bowl 57 triumph marked the beginning of the Chiefs' current championship streak. Mahomes and Co. last year became just the ninth team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls, and they now  
We were a play away from the Super Bowl the year before and had 4 straight playoff runs with at least one win. Just because the media declares New England and Denver the AFFCG in week 2 every year doesn't mean it's going to be true. 
For the Eagles to win Super Bowl LIX, Chris Simms believes that Jalen Hurts will have to audible at the line of scrimmage and expect the unexpected against the Chiefs' defense. 
Limiting Barkley hasn’t put the clamps on the Eagles’ ability to win. Knocking Hurts off his game has. There were six games in 2024 in which Philadelphia’s quarterbacks recorded a passer  
Tom Brady has the most career wins by a quarterback in Super Bowls, with 7 wins. 
7. 1996 New England Patriots. Previous season: 6-10, 5.7 Pythagorean wins Super Bowl season: 11-5, 10.6 Pythagorean wins Why they improved: The Patriots improved from the league's 23rd-ranked  
Just ask the 1969 Jets, who won Super Bowl III despite being 18-point underdogs. However, you’d be hard pressed to find a more shocking Super Bowl upset than the one the New York Giants pulled off in 2008. Their opponents, the New England Patriots, finished the season 16-0, and boasted one of the most lethal offenses in NFL history. 
4 wins: Green Bay Packers, New York Giants, Kansas City Chiefs 3 wins: Denver Broncos, Washington Redskins/Commanders, LA / Oakland Raiders In 2025, Super Bowl LIX sees the Philadelphia Eagles  
After years of bouncing around the league and being labeled a bust, he found himself leading the Raiders in Super Bowl XV. The Raiders blew out the favored Philadelphia Eagles 27-10, becoming the first wild-card team to ever win the Super Bowl. Plunkett, who had been written off by just about everyone, earned Super Bowl MVP honors. </p>
