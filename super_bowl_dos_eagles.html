        <p>Entering Super Bowl 59 this year, Philadelphia has been to four NFL title games and holds a 1-3 record in Super Bowl matchups. The Eagles lost in each of their first two Super Bowl appearances.

The Eagles’ journey to their Super Bowl victory is rooted in strong team-building and a commitment to excellence. Founded in 1933, the franchise initially found success in the pre-Super Bowl era, winning three NFL Championships (1948, 1949, and 1960). However, a Super Bowl title eluded them for decades. 
The Philadelphia Eagles have won one Super Bowl in franchise history. The Eagles were champions of the 2017 NFL season after beating the Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. Before the Super Bowl era, the Eagles won three NFL Championships in 1948, 1949, and 1960. 
The Eagles won their only Super Bowl in the 2017 season and Nick Foles, the QB in that game against New England, was the honorary captain.
