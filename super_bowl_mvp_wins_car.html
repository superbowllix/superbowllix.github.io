From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX the Super Bowl MVP won a new car as a part of their MVP award. However, since Hyundai became the official vehicle partner of the NFL from the 2015 NFL season onward no new car has been awarded to the Super Bowl MVP since Super Bowl 50. [13]

From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XLIX, MVP winners received a new car as part of their prize. However, this tradition ended when Hyundai became the official NFL sponsor in 2015 . 
The list of Super Bowl MVPs includes some of the biggest names in the sport, so etching your name into that history book is impressive, to say the least. Up until 2015, Super Bowl MVP winners were also given a free car. Tom Brady, after winning the award for his Super Bowl 49 performance, was the last Super Bowl MVP to be given a free vehicle. 
One Super Bowl tradition came to an end a couple years ago when the NFL stopped giving the game’s MVP a brand new car. But over the years MVPs drove off in some of the nicest cars and trucks available at that time. Here are a few of those lucky guys and their rides. Bart Starr – 1967 &amp; 68 
The prize for his MVP performance was a blue Dodge Charger R/T, complete with a snarling 440-cid V8. “That’s why I call the MVP car a win-win-win,” Namath explained. “Even Uncle Sam gets his cut.” While the first years of the Super Bowl coincided with the heyday of American muscle, not every MVP was so fired up about receiving a

FOR five decades, the Super Bowl's most valuable player has walked away with a new ride - but Patrick Mahomes won't be adding new wheels to his garage after winning this year's award. The Green Bay Packers won the first Super Bowl in NFL history, and the game's winning quarterback, Bart Starr, brought home a new Corvette. 
As I’ve blogged since 2019 on this blog and every year since, I’ve confirmed the Super Bowl MVP doesn’t get a car.. In fact, the last time a Super Bowl MVP won a car was in 2015 when Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady won a 2015 Chevrolet Colorado from GM and then turned around and re-gifted it to Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler, the arguable hero of the that particular game. 
Though the goal for any team is to win the Super Bowl and hoist the Lombardi Trophy, the Seattle Seahawks were playing for individual hardware too in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
In 2014, Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith won Super Bowl MVP, as well as a new Chevrolet Silverado.  For those who want to see the Super Bowl MVP get a car, here’s some interesting news.

Yes, Mahomes has won Super Bowl MVP three times during his career. Every time his team has won the Lombardi Trophy, he ended up taking home MVP honors. He will be hoping to continue both trends in  
Super Bowl MVPs have been getting cars for decades, but here’s why Patrick Mahomes probably won’t get a car this year. Every year, moments after the Super Bowl MVP gets their trophy, NFL fans across the world wonder if a car manufacturer rep will step up to say a few words before rewarding the big game’s star player with a set of keys to a brand new car (or truck or SUV) parked just off

Some fans may be taken aback when they find out that the Super Bowl MVP isn’t getting a free vehicle after the game. However, this prize isn’t the common practice it once was. 
But there’s another corporate Super Bowl tradition that has fallen by the wayside in recent years: Awarding a new car to the game’s most valuable player, a ritual that ended seven years ago.It  </p>
