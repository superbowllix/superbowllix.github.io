        <p>I mean I get people will shit on Super Bowl 53, but I definitely isn't the only boring Super Bowl of the last 20 years. Ravens/Giants was boring Bucs/Raiders was boring Steelers/Seahawks was boring and was a horrifically reffed game Colts/Bears was eh Seahawks/Broncos was a complete beatdown and never in doubt. Broncos/Panthers was eh. 
#1- Super Bowl 51 Patriots-34 Falcons-28. I think this is the consensus opinion on the best Super Bowl out of this group and it has a good case for greatest Super Bowl ever but I think Ravens-49ers or Steelers-Cardinals are pretty hard to top. 
2014 Divisional Round against the Ravens though. overcame a 14 point deficit twice.That game was something else. SB51 was incredible and is definitely up there in best games, but I've seen that game before against the 49ers, I think back in like 2012 was the game where we got blown out and then came back hard (lost unfortunately by like 3 points) and the Broncos I think in 2013 where we were  
Super Bowl XXIII: 49ers 20, Bengals 16 The berth of "Joe Cool," as Joe Montana leads an 11-play, 92-yard drive in the final minutes for a game-winning touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds  
2. Super Bowl XLIII: Steelers 27, Cardinals 23 It was a game many thought would be the perfect bookend to Kurt Warner's Hall of Fame career, but it turned on two iconic plays by Pittsburgh players. 
In the postseason, Young’s offense scored 44, 38, and 49 points in the Niners’ three wins. In the Super Bowl, Young torched the Chargersto put it lightly. Young finished with 325 yards and six touchdowns. Jerry Rice put together another historic Super Bowl performance of his own — hauling in 10 catches for 149 yards and three TDs. 
The best player in NFL history adds another Super Bowl MVP to his ledger to join Michael Jordan (6), Tom Brady (5) and LeBron James (4) as the only players in NFL/NBA/MLB/NHL history with at least  
The Best. 4. Super Bowl XXXIV: January 30, 2000, Georgia Dome in Atlanta . St. Louis Rams 23, Tennessee Titans 16 . St. Louis Rams linebacker Mike Jones keeps Tennessee Titans wide receiver Kevin  
It was only the second Super Bowl to enter the fourth quarter with the score tied (3-3) though, ultimately, the Rams would match Miami's 47-year old mark for fewest points scored on Super Sunday. 34. 
Super Bowl 2025 is right around the corner, with the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles poised to face off at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on February 9. Of course, the Super Bowl  
Patrick Mahomes in his first 4 years as a starter: 4 AFC Championship game appearances all in Arrowhead, 2 Super Bowl appearances (so far) a Super Bowl win, Super Bowl MVP, and regular season MVP. Has to be the best start of a career in the history of the NFL for a QB right?

EDIT: Looking at this thread, it appears there are two camps of nacho. The other camp is the liquid queso camp. The nachos above are more like a pull-apart chewy cheese like you find on pizza. I guess the only way to settle the debate is to bring both to a Super Bowl party.

Big games are best to bet on though because you know the effort will be there. Betting moneylines during the year isn’t the best strategy because the law of averages spreads will be better odds. But in a game where the team you bet will be going all out, if you really think they’ll win you can go big. Does that make any sense? </p>
