Though that name was good enough, the late Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt came up with the term "Super Bowl." Sports Illustrated reports Lamar's suggestion was "inspired by his son's 'Super Ball' toy." Ultimately, the league owners decided on the "AFL-NFL Championship Game," but Lamar's suggestion remained an option.
