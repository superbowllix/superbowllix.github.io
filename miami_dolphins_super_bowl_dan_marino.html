        <p>This is an accepted version of this page This is the latest accepted revision, reviewed on 31 January 2025. American football player (born 1961) For the singer formerly billed as Danny Marino, see Danny (Finnish singer). American football player Dan Marino Marino preparing for a 2005 ESPN interview Miami Dolphins Position: Special advisor Personal information Born: (1961-09-15) September 15  
Miami Dolphins 16 vs. San Francisco 49ers 38 on January 20th, 1985 - Full team and player stats and box score  Super Bowl XIX - Miami Dolphins vs. San Francisco  
The game was hyped as the battle between two great quarterbacks: Miami's Dan Marino and San Francisco's Joe Montana. The Dolphins entered their fifth Super Bowl in team history after posting a 14–2 regular season record. 
Marino led Miami to 10 playoff appearances and one Super Bowl game in 1985. Unfortunately, the Dolphins suffered a 38-16 defeat against Joe Montana's San Francisco 49ers in the one big game that  
The battle between Marino and Montana had this Super Bowl battle drawing huge hype, even by Super Bowl standards. This remains the only time in history that two teams with a combined 29 regular season wins met in a Super Bowl. Miami was a (+3) underdog and for a quarter, it looked the game might meet expectations. 
Dan Marino is widely considered the greatest quarterback never to have won a Super Bowl. He brought the Miami Dolphins to one early in his career, sparking hopes of future championships for the franchise. Marino never got the Dolphins back to the big stage after his second year in the league and first as the team’s No. 1 quarterback. 
Dan Marino, right, confers with coach Don Shula on the sideline during Super Bowl XIX on Jan. 20, 1985, at Stanford Stadium in California. It was Marino's only Super Bowl — and he lost. “I thought we had a lot of good teams,” he said. “It just goes to show how hard it is to win a Super Bowl, because there’s so much change in the league. 
In 1984, Dan Marino punted just about every NFL record into the sun on his way to leading the Dolphins to a 14-2 record, an AFC Championship, and a trip to Super Bowl XIX to face off against Joe  
Marino and the Dolphins faced the San Francisco 49ers, led by Joe Montana, one of the famous retired quarterbacks whose Super Bowl résumé stands in stark contrast to Marino’s. Montana, in his prime, was surgical, throwing for 331 yards and three touchdowns en route to a 38-16 victory over Miami. 
When the Miami Dolphins lost in Super Bowl XIX to the San Francisco 49ers, Dolphins fans were disappointed but optimistic. After all, starting QB Dan Marino had broken multiple records in just his second season in the league, as he broke the records for most passing touchdowns in a single season (48) and passing yards (5,084). 
Later, Marino chatted with Adam Schein of Mad Dog Sports Radio where the topic of Tua Tagovailoa and his chances of leading the Dolphins to a Super Bowl in his career was discussed. 
Dan Marino, a quarterback from the University of Pittsburgh, was selected by the Miami Dolphins as the 27th pick, in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft. Much like Griese, Marino was slated to develop under starting quarterback David Woodley . 
Later, Marino chatted with Adam Schein of Mad Dog Sports Radio where the topic of Tua Tagovailoa and his chances of leading the Dolphins to a Super Bowl in his career was discussed. 
Snowball it did. As a team, the 49ers broke new ground. Their 537 yards gained in total offense, 326 passing (331 minus five on one sack) and 211 rushing, set a Super Bowl record. It was the most yards they'd gained in a game since '61. To put it in still tighter perspective, in their '82 Super Bowl victory over Cincinnati the Niners had 275 yards. 
Super Bowl XIX . For the second time in three years, Miami was returning to the Super Bowl. The matchup for Super Bowl XIX looked juicy as Marino would face the San Francisco 49ers and their ace, Joe Montana. Miami was in control by the end of the first quarter, taking a 10-7 lead. That proved to be the highlight of the day for the Fins. 
Dan the Man, Dan Marino! Dolphins fans will never forget the forever impact he had &amp; continues to bring post career for the Miami Dolphins organizations. Although he was never able to win a Super Bowl, his presence, hard work, determination, and skill lead the Dolphins to ten playoff appearances with one Super Bowl appearance []

Dan Marino, born Daniel Constantine Marino Jr. on September 15, 1961, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a former professional American football quarterback renowned for his exceptional career with the Miami Dolphins in the National Football League (NFL). 
And while they came up short against Joe Montana and the 49ers in Super Bowl XIX, Marino's 318 passing yards was at the time tied for the second-highest total in Super Bowl history. 1. The 1984  
The Dolphins were certain to return to a Super Bowl, and Marino was certain to face Chicago again for a Lombardi Trophy. Anyone who watched the Bears and Dolphins that season knew it had to happen  </p>
