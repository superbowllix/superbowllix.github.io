        <h2><strong>any super bowl overtime new orleans super bowl record</strong></h2>
        <p>Super Bowl LI (2017) was the first to go to overtime, while the second was Super Bowl LVIII (2024). The NFL uses different overtime rules during the regular season and the playoffs. 
In what is widely regarded as the most thrilling Super Bowl ever, Atlanta led 28-3 in the third quarter until Tom Brady and his teammates rallied and forced overtime, with the result level at 28-28. 
That game is one of the greatest comebacks in Super Bowl history, with the New England Patriots defeating the Atlanta Falcons in overtime, 34-28, in Super Bowl LI. 
The New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons became the first two teams to enter overtime in a Super Bowl game. The Patriots won the coin toss, and they elected to receive the football. 
In the first 56 Super Bowls, though, only one went into overtime, when the New England Patriots rallied from behind to win 34-28 over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. 
When was the first and only Super Bowl that went overtime? Who played in it, and what was the eventual outcome? Super Bowl 51: The only overtime game in history. Five years ago, the Patriots and Falcons met in Super Bowl 51. Yep. It’s that Super Bowl. The one known simply by a score: 28-3. The odds of any Super Bowl going to overtime are slim. 
Two Super Bowls have gone to overtime: Super Bowl LI and Super Bowl LVIII. The Patriots beat the Falcons in Super Bowl LI and the Chiefs beat the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. Super Bowl Overtime Rules. Super Bowl overtime rules are the same as NFL playoff overtime rules: Both teams have the opportunity to possess the football. If the game is tied  
Only two Super Bowl have ever gone to overtime. You might remember both. Somehow, the Patriots forced an extra period despite trailing the Falcons 28-3. And of course Tom Brady and New England won  
The first Super Bowl that went to overtime also ended in walk-off fashion, but that game was more famous for its historic comeback than it's extra session. How many Super Bowls have gone to overtime? Prior to Sunday, only one Super Bowl had gone to overtime: the New England Patriots' 34-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. 
Prior to Sunday, only one Super Bowl had gone to overtime: the New England Patriots' 34-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. Better known as the 28-3 game. COMEBACK COMPLETE. 
Overtime in any sport is thrilling and the NFL is no different. The 2023 postseason featured the debut of new NFL overtime rules. It ensures both teams receive at least one possession in any playoff game that goes to overtime. Below, we will discuss the differences between the overtime rules for the regular season compared to the NFL playoffs. 
One of the biggest criticisms of the NFL’s overtime rule pre-2023 was that the overtime period represented a much different game than the previous 60 minutes did. From 2010 to '22, there were 11  
Only one Super Bowl has ever needed overtime, and it didn't happen until Super Bowl 51 between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons. The Patriots stormed back from a 28-3 deficit to score  
The San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs are tied 16-16 in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LVIII.. If overtime happens, it wouldn't be a first for a Super Bowl. 
Has the Super Bowl Ever Gone Into Overtime? Yes, the Super Bowl has gone into overtime before. However, it's a rare likelihood and FanDuel Sportsbook's Super Bowl odds show +1080 odds that this year's game will go to overtime and -2000 odds that it will not. It's only occurred once in 56 previous games, with SB LI between the New England  
Sunday’s loss is Shanahan’s second as a head coach in the Super Bowl; four years ago, the 49ers blew a 10-point fourth-quarter lead to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV, eventually losing 31-20.

The Grid: Your Gateway to Super Bowl Squares Fun. Imagine a 10×10 grid, similar to a bingo card. (free printable grid here) Each row and column is numbered 0-9.One team (usually the designated “home” team) gets assigned the rows, while the other team (the “visitor”) gets assigned the columns. 
Super Bowl 58 went to overtime between the Chiefs and 49ers, and after San Francisco kicked a field goal with 7:22 left in the first overtime, the Chiefs drove down to the 49ers' three-yard line  
They punted and gave the ball back to Brady and gave him a chance to take the Super Bowl to overtime. New England comes up clutch and forces overtime in Super Bowl 51. On their own 9-yard line, the Patriots were 91 yards and a 2-point conversion from immortality and Super Bowl history. No Super Bowl had ever gone to overtime. They needed to be  </p>
